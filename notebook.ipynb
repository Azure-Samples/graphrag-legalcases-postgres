This argument is incorrect under case law more recent than Trigg. Only if the waters are determined to be “surface waters” are the Postemas entitled to seek the shield of the common enemy doctrine.

The case also involves issues concerning RCW 90.03.380, the surface water statute governing changes in and transfers of water rights, and issues of abandonment and statutory forfeiture of water rights. We conclude that the Department of Ecology has authority to impose bypass flow conditions in a water quality certification regardless of whether the applicant has existing water rights that may be affected. We also conclude that when acting on change applications under RCW 90.03.380, Ecology may not deny an application based upon public interest considerations, and that the change statute does not apply to inchoate water rights.

First, as to payment of fees, the statute states that “the failure to file statement and pay the fees, as herein required, for any power site or claim of power rights on account of riparian ownership within two years after June 12, 1929, shall be conclusive evidence of abandonment.” RCW 90.16.060 (emphasis added). The statute was enacted in 1929 and, evidently, the quoted language was intended to assure that power developers complied with the new act’s provisions in a timely fashion.

See, e.g., RCW 90.03.030; RCW 90.44.040. In this connection, we disagree with the District’s contention that the absence of a savings clause in chapter 90.48 RCW has no significance. The District says that the state Water Pollution Control Act, chapter 90.48 RCW, simply authorizes the “discharge” of material into water that causes or tends to cause pollution, and authorizes cooperation with the federal government under the Clean Water Act. The District maintains that the withdrawal and use of water is not the same as the discharge of pollutant(s) under the state Water Pollution Control Act or the Clean Water Act. Therefore, the District says, neither the Congress nor the Legislature authorized regulation of the use of water under existing water rights.\\nOf course, Elkhorn II clearly holds to the contrary as far as the Clean Water Act is co...</td>\n",

       "70     Postemas claim the water is surface water. Smith, and his expert, claim the water was a natural watercourse. If the water comes from a natural watercourse or through a “natural drain,” the common enemy rule does not apply. The Postemas argue that even if the water were not surface water, they still have no liability because they only directed it through the natural watercourse. This argument is incorrect under case law more recent than Trigg. Only if the waters are determined to be “surface waters” are the Postemas entitled to seek the shield of the common enemy doctrine. The determination of what classification of water is involved is a question for the trier of fact and should not be taken from “the jury.” There are disputed issues of material fact, and summary judgment should not have been granted.\\nAlternatively, even if the Postemas are correct, that these waters are merely surface waters, there also exists a question of material fact as to whether the Postemas’ upstream actions caused a greater dis...   \n",

Moreover, we do not find' in the record that the estimates of the plaintiffs ’ witnesses were disputed by the other side. There was a leakage from the roof at one time for which the defendants admitted fault, and they offered testimony to the effect that the damage caused thereby did not exceed $50, but on the general question of the amount of damages, the cause went to the jury on the testimony of the plaintiffs ’ witnesses. It would seem that, under these circumstances, the court could hardly find either passion or prejudice had the verdict been for the full amount demanded.\\nThe second contention under this head is that the overwhelming weight of the evidence relating to the cause of the damage is against the verdict of the jury. It is first argued that the building was constructed according to the plans and specifications, and if it was so constructed as not to furnish protection agai...   \n",
       "504   Madsen, J.\\n— This case raises the question whether the Department of Ecology has authority to condition a water quality certification under the Clean Water Act of 1977 (33 U.S.C. §§ 1251-1387) on maintenance of minimum instream flows, where such conditions affect existing water rights. The case also involves issues concerning RCW 90.03.380, the surface water statute governing changes in and transfers of water rights, and issues of abandonment and statutory forfeiture of water rights. We conclude that the Department of Ecology has authority to impose bypass flow conditions in a water quality certification regardless of whether the applicant has existing water rights that may be affected. We also conclude that when acting on change applications under RCW 90.03.380, Ecology may not deny an application based upon public interest considerations, and that the change statute does not apply to inchoate water rights. In addition, we conclude that the water rights at issue were neither abandoned nor forfeited unde...   \n",

It also paid fees in connection with the 1980 water right, although for a period of years it failed to pay the fees for most of the 440 cfs right, due to a clerical error. In 1998, it informed Ecology about the missing fees and paid the late fees.\\nIn 1992, the District proposed to reestablish power generation. The new Sullivan Creek Project would use the same configuration for the project as the original project, but would be bigger than the original. As noted, in 1994 the District filed the application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to amend its federal license to allow power generation. Because the project requires a federal license, on October 30, 1996, the District filed an application for a state water quality certification with the Department of Ecology (Ecology), as required under the Clean Water Act. On October 28, 1997, Ecology issued an order certifying that the District’s project complies with the act a...   \n",

We do not read RCW 90.16.060 as providing for such abandonment. First, as to payment of fees, the statute states that “the failure to file statement and pay the fees, as herein required, for any power site or claim of power rights on account of riparian ownership within two years after June 12, 1929, shall be conclusive evidence of abandonment.” RCW 90.16.060 (emphasis added). The statute was enacted in 1929 and, evidently, the quoted language was intended to assure that power developers complied with the new act’s provisions in a timely fashion. Nothing in the statute indicates that the abandonment provision applies to the failure to pay fees after 1931. Moreover, the rest of the statute demonstrates that it does not.

The applicants there were a city and a local utility district that wanted to build a dam, and applied for a hydroelectric license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

He also argued that under § 101(g) the irrigation exemption should be applied so as to avoid impairment or abrogation of his state allocated irrigation rights, which he claimed were rendered virtually meaningless otherwise.\\nThe court disagreed, reasoning that “any incidental effect on [the farmer’s] rights to state-allocated water from [the river] is justified because protection of [the wetlands] is the type of legitimate purpose for which the [Clean Water] Act was intended.” Akers, 785 F.2d at 821.

See, e.g., RCW 90.03.030; RCW 90.44.040. In this connection, we disagree with the District’s contention that the absence of a savings clause in chapter 90.48 RCW has no significance. The District says that the state Water Pollution Control Act, chapter 90.48 RCW, simply authorizes the “discharge” of material into water that causes or tends to cause pollution, and authorizes cooperation with the federal government under the Clean Water Act. The District maintains that the withdrawal and use of water is not the same as the discharge of pollutant(s) under the state Water Pollution Control Act or the Clean Water Act.
