The case was tried to the court, and judgment rendered in favor of defendants.\\nMay 14, 1923, the town of Long Beach passed ordinance No. 48, creating local improvement District No. 6, which district included the property involved in this action and was owned at that time by Lillian E. Stout.\\nMarch 17, 1924, the town council passed ordinance No. 59, confirming the assessment which had been spread against the properties included within the district. Thereafter, Mrs. Stout failed to pay the assessments as they became due. After the assessments became delinquent, the town treasurer attempted to give notice of foreclosure and sale under the provisions of Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 9250 [P. C. \\u00a7 7580].\\nNotice was published March 18, March 25, and April 1, 1927. Respondents\\u2019 predecessors in interest purchased the property at the sale April 2, 1927, and received a certificate therefor. Mrs. Stout having failed to redeem the property within the two year period provided by statute, it was deeded by the mayor and clerk of the town of Long Beach, December 17, 1929, to the purchasers at the foreclosure sale. No notice, either personal or by publication other than that to which we have just referred, was afforded to Mrs. Stout.\\nMrs. Stout deeded to appellants her interest in the property involved June 8, 1933, and this action was begun March 14, 1936. Neither she nor appellants have been in possession since December 17, 1929.\\nIn their answer to the complaint, respondents pleaded that the action was not brought within three years after the date of the deed given by the city, and that the action was, therefore, barred by the three year statute of limitations, Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 9394-1 [P. C. \\u00a7 1022-1].\\nAppellants urge error on the part of the trial court in holding that respondents were the owners of the property free and clear of all claims of the appellants. They take the position that the tax deed under which the respondents claim title is void for want of compliance with the notice requirements of Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7\\u00a7 9250 and 9256 [P. C. \\u00a7\\u00a77580, 7586]; further, that the deed is void on its face because not signed by the city treasurer as provided for by the terms of \\u00a7 9256. It is appellants\\u2019 contention that a deed issued subject to these defects is not sufficient to set in motion the three year statute of limitations upon which respondents rely.\\nWe are of the opinion that the action is barred by the statute of limitations. In the discussion of the case, we assume that the deed given by the city was, as contended by appellants, void.\\nLaws of 1927, chapter 275, p. 666, \\u00a7 6, Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 9394-1, provides:\\n\\u201cActions to set aside or cancel any deed heretofore or hereafter issued after and upon the sale of property for local improvement assessments or for the recovery of property sold for delinquent local improvement assessments must be brought within three years from and after date of the issuance of such deed; provided that this section shall not apply to actions not otherwise barred on deeds heretofore issued or property heretofore sold if the same be commenced within one year after the passage of this act.\\u201d\\nBy comparing the above quoted section of our statute with Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 162 [P. C. \\u00a7 8167], which reads:\\n\\u201cActions to set aside or cancel the deed of any county treasurer issued after and upon the sale of lands for general, state, county or municipal taxes, or for the recovery of lands sold for delinquent taxes, must be brought within three years from and after the date of the issuance of such treasurer\\u2019s deed: Provided, that this section shall not apply to actions not otherwise barred on deeds heretofore issued if the same be commenced within one year after the passage of this act.\\u201d\\nwe find them to be identical, with the exception that \\u00a7 9394-1 refers to deeds to property sold to satisfy the lien of local improvement assessments and \\u00a7 162 applies to deeds given as the result of foreclosure of general tax liens.\\nThis court has, in the cases of Cordiner v. Dear, 55 Wash. 479,104 Pac. 780; Huber v. Brown, 57 Wash. 654, 107 Pac. 850; Baylis v. Kerrick, 64 Wash. 410, 116 Pac. 1082; Fleming v. Stearns, 66 Wash. 655, 120 Pac. 522; Savage v. Ash, 86 Wash. 43, 149 Pac. 325; Keller v. Davis, 93 Wash. 336, 160 Pac. 946; Porter v. Burkley, 112 Wash. 282, 191 Pac. 799; and Jorgensen v. Thurston County, 145 Wash. 282, 259 Pac. 720, given full force and effect to the limitation contained in \\u00a7 162 by holding that a tax deed issued more than three years before the beginning of an action attacking it becomes invulnerable even though the foreclosure proceedings contained jurisdictional defects.\\nIn the case of Huber v. Brown, supra, this court said:\\n\\u201cThe point is made that the published summons and the affidavit upon which it is based are so defective that the court did not acquire jurisdiction, and that the judgment is therefore void, and that a tax deed based upon a void judgment is not within the protection of the statute. This is no longer an open question in this state. A like question was made in Hamilton v. Witner, 50 Wash. 689, 97 Pac. 1084, 126 Am. St. 921, and in Lara v. Sandell, 52 Wash. 53, 100 Pac. 166. In the Lara case we said:\\n\\u201c \\u2018Whatever the rule may be in other jurisdictions, it is firmly established in this state that a void tax deed may constitute a sufficient basis for the running of the statute of limitations.\\u2019\\n\\u201cIn these cases the court was considering the seven-year statute of limitations, but we do not conceive that a different principle should obtain in applying the provisions of the act of 1907, which is special to tax deeds and general in its terms. Its purpose was to foreclose investigation as to the validity of the proceedings leading up to the judgment unless challenged within the time limited by the act. The precise question was raised in Cordiner v. Dear, 55 Wash. 479, 104 Pac. 780. Whilst this question was not discussed in the opinion, it was assumed that the law was settled in this jurisdiction adversely to the appellant\\u2019s contention. The act of 1907 would serve no purpose if limited to deeds executed on sales regularly made upon valid judgments only. Such deeds need no legislative aid.\\u201d\\nAnd in the case of Savage v. Ash, supra, the following statement was made:\\n\\u201cOn the second branch of the objection, it will not be disputed that the legislature has power to limit the time within which actions may be commenced where fraud enters into the transaction, and this regardless of the question whether the fraud is discovered or discoverable within the statutory period. The question is never one of power but always one of intent, and here the question is, did the legislature intend the statute under consideration to bar all actions brought for the purposes mentioned unless brought within three years. On its face it so indicates. It contains no exceptions whatsoever. It was enacted long after the enactment of the section on which the appellant relies, and, in so far as a conflict exists between the two, must be read as superseding that section. It is in aid of the taxing power. Speedy and prompt payment of taxes are necessary to an economical administration of the state\\u2019s affairs, and to secure this the law provides that, if the owner will not pay the taxes levied upon his property, another may pay them for him and have a lien on the property for the amount paid, which he can enforce as other liens are enforced. But tax titles, seemingly, especially in the earlier periods of our history, did not meet with favor from the courts; indeed, with such little regard were such titles held that the phrase \\u2018worthless as a tax title\\u2019 was proverbial, and no one but those of a speculative turn would deal with property under such titles, and those only in cases where the chances of gain were large and the amount risked proportionately small. The purpose of statutes like the present is to make such titles desirable as investments by making them more secure, and we think the manifest purpose of the present statute was to fix a time beyond which a tax foreclosure proceeding cannot be questioned for any cause whatsoever.\\u201d\\nThe reasoning relative to the interpretation of \\u00a7 162 which is included in the foregoing excerpts applies with equal force and effect to the provisions of \\u00a7 9394-1. Appellants\\u2019 argument, based upon defects in the giving of notice, is squarely met by, and falls before, the weight of this authority.\\nThe second contention made by appellants is that, as the deed given by the town was not signed by its treasurer as commanded by statute, and was therefore void upon its face, its execution, delivery, and recording was not sufficient to start the running of the statute of limitations.\\n\\u201cThere is great conflict of authority as to whether a deed which is void on its face will give color of title. Many decisions hold that such deeds do not give color of title. But the weight of authority is to the effect that a deed void on its face may give color of title as effectually as though the deed was regular on its face and void for reasons dehors the instrument.\\u201d 2 C. J. 176, \\u00a7 338.\\n\\u201cThere is no doubt that a deed fair on its face constitutes color of title, no matter what defect may really exist in the proceedings; but it has been held that a deed void on its face would not amount to color of title. The weight of authority and reason is, however, to the effect that whether the deed be void on its face or not, if it is a deed, and of such a character that an ordinary purchaser unskilled in the learning of the law might believe it to be a good conveyance, it will be sufficient.\\u201d 2 Blackwell on Tax Titles (5th ed.), 805, \\u00a7 861.\\nWe are unable to apprehend why distinction should be drawn between a fact appearing upon the face of a deed which shows a defect in title, and a fact existing outside the deed having the same effect, which the purchaser is equally bound to notice.\\nThe statute, \\u00a7 9394-1, does not contain language which shows, or in any way tends to show, that the legislature contemplated difference in the legal consequences attendant upon one or the other of these possible defects in the purchaser\\u2019s title. The statute, in fixing the limit of three years in which action may be instituted, makes no reference to the form or contents of the deed. It does not state that the tax deed must be valid upon its face. It provides in plain, concise language that the action to set aside or cancel \\u201cany deed . . . must be brought within three years from and after the date and issuance of such deed.\\u201d\\nNo logical reason can be advanced for establishing a distinction between defects which are apparent upon the face of the deed itself and defects appearing in the record of the proceedings anterior to the issuance of the deed.\\nThe trial court was correct in holding that the action could not be maintained, and the judgment is accordingly affirmed.\\nBlake, C.

Rev. Stat. (Sup.), \\u00a7 784-1 [P. C. \\u00a7 8108-21] et seq., Laws of 1935, chapter 113, p. 305, as amended by Laws of 1937, chapter 14, p. 39), to have its rights and liabilities determined under a certain fife insurance policy issued by plaintiff upon the life of Paul E. Newport, Jr. Defendants demanded a jury, claiming they had a right so to do under Rem. Rev. Stat. (Sup.), \\u00a7 784-9 [P. C. \\u00a7 8108-29], there being an issue of fact to be determined. The procedure in this case was not questioned.\\nIt is undisputed that plaintiff, on February 27, 1933, issued an insurance policy on the life of Paul E. Newport, Jr., in consideration of the annual premium of $36.88, which premium covered a period of one year, from February 27, 1933, to February 27, 1934; that, by the terms of this policy, plaintiff agreed to pay, upon the death of Paul E. Newport, Jr., who was then approximately eighteen years of age, the sum of two thousand dollars to his brother, Richard Newport, a minor, who was then about seven years of age. The policy contained the following provision:\\n\\u201cSelf-Destruction.\\u2014In event of self-destruction during the first two insurance years, whether the insured be sane or insane, the insurance under this policy shall be a sum equal to the premiums thereon which have been paid to and received by the company and no more.\\u201d\\nThe policy also contained the usual two year non-contestable clause required to be a part of all such policies issued in this state.\\nIt appears that Paul E. Newport, Jr., died on or about January 21, 1934, and prior to the expiration of the first two insurance years of the policy; that, on the death of insured, and after an investigation of the facts surrounding such death, plaintiff denied all liability to pay to the beneficiary the sum of two thousand dollars and so notified Paul E. Newport, Sr., father of the minor beneficiary, but plaintiff did admit liability for, and offered to pay to the father of the beneficiary, the sum of $36.88, the amount of.the premiums paid, in full settlement of all its liability under the policy; that plaintiff, at all times after making such investigation, claimed insured\\u2019s death was deliberately self-inflicted, and that plaintiff was therefore not liable under the policy, except as herein stated, while defendants alleged and at all times claimed insured\\u2019s death was not self-inflicted, and that plaintiff was hable for the full amount of the policy.\\nThere was considerable testimony introduced relative to the general habits, activities, mental and physical condition of insured, and it must be admitted that he was an exceptional young man in many respects. The testimony shows that, in spite of a physical handicap of one leg being about an inch and a half shorter than the other, resulting apparently from an early sickness, he excelled in many outdoor sports, and had taken a great interest in the boy scout work. There was testimony to the effect that, in 1930, two operations were performed on insured, in an endeavor to correct this physical defect. There was testimony, which the jury were entitled to believe, that these operations were not as successful as hoped for, although the defect was helped to some extent; that, after these operations, there was soreness and pain in the foot, and that the boy began to be troubled with insomnia; that visits were made to doctors in regard to this condition of nervousness, and that a nerve specialist was recommended; that he was withdrawn from high school at various times and sent to the country. There was some testimony that the boy had developed some sort of a complex and had threatened to take his life.\\nOn January 21, 1934, insured took his mother\\u2019s coupe and apparently drove to a small clearing in the woods just south of the Spokane city limits, where his body was found the next day, lying on the ground about twenty-five feet from the car. A few feet from the head, and backward from it, was a .410 short-barreled shotgun, which the insured had purchased a few days before, without the knowledge of his family or friends. At the time the boy was found, all of his clothing was in place, his shirt and undershirt being tucked in his trousers, and his outer garments being in place. The clothing was not penetrated in any way, and there was no blood on the clothing, except in the immediate area of the wound. It was evident the gun must have been held practically against the body, as the wad from the shell was found in the heart. Plaintiff demonstrated to the jury the manner in which it contended the act could have been committed, while counsel for defendants claimed and attempted to demonstrate the impossibility of self-destruction. There was testimony also that, about noon of the day of insured\\u2019s death, he was seen, with a stranger whom the witnesses did not recognize, driving his mother\\u2019s car on Grand avenue, toward and about five miles from the place where the body was found.\\nThe jury returned a unanimous verdict for plaintiff, and-further found that defendants were entitled to recover $36.88, as returned premium, and interest thereon from date of proof of death.\\nDefendants moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and in the alternative for a new trial, upon the last four statutory grounds permitted under Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 399 [P. C. \\u00a7 8225]. The court denied the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and granted defendants\\u2019 motion for new trial, as shown in the order, for the sole reason that the court erred in failing to give defendants\\u2019 proposed instructions Nos. 6 and. 7. Plaintiff has appealed, making the following assignments of error: (1) In entering the order granting a new trial; (2) in holding that it failed to give defendants\\u2019 amended instruction No. 6 and proposed instruction No. 7; (3) in holding that it failed to give defendants\\u2019 amended instruction No. 6 and proposed instruction No. 7, and that such failure was error; (4) in failing and refusing to enter judgment for plaintiff upon the verdict of the jury.\\nWhile the trial court, as shown by its memorandum opinion, did not feel that, under the instructions as given, the respondents were limited in their argument to the jury on their theory of the case, which was that the shot may have been fired by some person other than deceased, either accidentally or intentionally, or that the jury were, in their deliberations, precluded from giving consideration to such theory, still the court seemed to feel that, because of its failure to give the proposed instructions, the theory of respondents may not have received the consideration of the jury to which it was entitled.\\nThe trial court granted the new trial on one specific ground, but we have consistently held, since our decision in Rochester v. Seattle etc. R. Co., 75 Wash. 559, 135 Pac. 209, that, although a motion for new trial be granted on a specific ground, where there is an appeal from such order by the adverse party, the one in whose favor the order was granted may, on such appeal, urge in support of the order before this court any ground set out in the motion, and that the appellate or reviewing court, even though it be of the opinion that the order cannot be sustained upon the specific ground stated, or reason given, by the trial court, will not reverse the order if it can be sustained upon any ground stated in the motion.\\nAmended instruction No. 6, proposed by respondents, provides:\\n\\u201cThe court instructs you that \\u2018the burden of proving suicide in an action on a life insurance policy is not sustained by proof of motive, with circumstances probably indicating suicide, if there is equal probability that death was accidental,\\u2019 or was deliberately or accidentally caused by some person other than the deceased.\\u201d\\nInstruction No. 9, as given by the court, provides:\\n\\u201cYou are instructed that the burden of proving suicide is not sustained by proof of motive, with circumstances probably indicating suicide, if there is equal probability that the death was accidental.\\u201d\\nInstruction No. 4, as given, provides:\\n\\u201cYou are instructed that upon a showing that death was caused by external and violent means, the presumption arises that the death was accidental, and such presumption remains in the case until overcome by evidence to the contrary.\\n\\u201cYou are further instructed that if you find from a fair preponderance of the evidence that the death of Paul E. Newport Jr. was caused by external and violent means, then the law raises a presumption that such death was accidental, and upon such showing, aided by the presumption, a prima facie case of accidental death is made.\\n\\u201cYou are instructed that suicide is an affirmative defense and in order that the plaintiff prevail, it must establish by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the wound which caused the death of Paul E. Newport Jr. was intentionally self-inflicted.\\u201d (Italics ours.)\\nThe court gave instruction No. 5, as follows:\\n\\u201cYou are instructed, however, that in order to find that the death of Paul E. Newport Jr. was intentionally self-inflicted, it is not necessary for you to find from the evidence that he had a motive or reason for committing suicide.\\u201d (Italics ours.)\\nInstruction No. 7, as given, provides in part:\\n\\u201cIf you find from the evidence that such a controversy exists, and also find under these instructions that the wound which caused the death of Paul E. Newport Jr. was intentionally self-inflicted, then your verdict must be for the plaintiff.\\n\\u201cYou are further instructed, however, that if, upon all the evidence, it is your conclusion that the death of Paul E. Newport Jr. by accident is equally as likely and probable as by suicide, then the defendant would be entitled to the benefit of the presumption of law that the death of the insured was not by suicide, and it would be your duty to return a verdict in favor of the defendant.\\u201d (Italics ours.)\\nInstruction No. 8, as given, is as follows:\\n\\u201cYou are instructed that in determining whether Paul E. Newport Jr., the insured, intentionally and designedly took his own life, you should consider any motive or lack of motive therefor, his condition of health, and all other facts and circumstances surrounding and connected with the death.\\u201d (Italics ours.)\\nAgain, in instruction No. 10, as given, the court instructed the jury that, in order for appellant to prevail, it must not only prove that the insured killed himself, but it must be shown that his act was deliberate, and that his death was not accidental.\\nInstruction No. 7, prepared by respondents and refused by the court, provides:\\n\\u201cThe court further instructs you that unless the plaintiff, New York Life Insurance Company, has established by a preponderance of the evidence that Paul E. Newport, Jr., intentionally killed himself, you shall return a verdict for the defendant, Paul E. Newport, guardian ad litem of Richard Newport, a minor, for the sum of Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000), with six per cent (6%) interest thereon from the time evidence or proof of his death was furnished to the plaintiff; and\\n\\u201cYou are further instructed that unless such intentional killing of deceased by himself has been so established by a preponderance of the evidence, the defendants do not have to prove that he accidentally killed himself, or that he was accidentally or intentionally killed by someone else, because the law presumes, in the absence of such proof by the plaintiff, that the deceased did not kill himself.\\u201d\\nIt is evident, we think, that the only question really involved in this trial was whether or not insured\\u2019s death was self-inflicted. If the jury found that it was, appellant was entitled to prevail; if not, appellant could not prevail, but the jury must find for respondents. The court, in at least seven different instructions, told the jury that, before the appellant could recover, it must prove by a fair preponderance of the testimony that the death of Paul E. Newport, Jr., was deliberately and intentionally self-inflicted. How the court could, in plainer language, have told the jury that appellant could prevail only under such circumstances, or how the jury could have been told more plainly that, unless they could so find, the presumption was that he did not kill himself, we are at a loss to understand. We think the court fairly and correctly instructed the jury on all the issues as presented by both parties, and could not have gone further than it did and have any basis in the evidence for any instruction which might have been given.\\nThe court, having properly covered the issues in the case by the instructions as given, erred in granting a new trial because of its failure to give the requested instructions.\\nWe appreciate the rule relative to the discretion of the trial court in granting or refusing to grant a new trial, but here we do not think there is any discretion involved, this being a purely legal matter, in which case we are in no way bound by the action of the trial court.\\nThe cases of McGee v. Wineholt, 23 Wash. 748, 63 Pac. 571; Gabrielson v. Hague Box & Lumber Co., 55 Wash. 342, 104 Pac. 635, 133 Am. St. 1032; Polk v. Spokane Interstate Fair, 73 Wash. 610, 132 Pac. 401; and others cited by respondents in support of their contention that the trial court in the instant case did not instruct the jury on their theory of the case, are not in point, for the reason, among others, that they either held, as in the McGee case, supra, that the court did not instruct at all on a matter in issue, or that the court, in its instructions, did not properly present the issues to the jury.\\nWe have considered the other grounds of respondents\\u2019 motion, and we are of the opinion that the order cannot be sustained on any of the grounds given.\\nIn Fagerdahl v. North Coast Transportation Co., 178 Wash. 482, 35 P. (2d) 46, we held that, where a verdict is returned in favor of plaintiff, and the defendant moves for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and in the alternative for a new trial, and the trial court overrules the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and grants the motion for a new trial, and the plaintiff appeals, the defendant may, upon that appeal, present the question as to whether the evidence was sufficient to take the case to the jury.\\nIn the instant case, respondents contend that there was not sufficient evidence to take the case to the jury, and that their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been granted. We are satisfied there was sufficient evidence introduced herein to warrant the jury in reaching the verdict returned, and that the trial court correctly denied the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\\nRespondents also contend that appellant should not have been permitted to raise the question of self-destruction, because of the two year noncontestable clause in the policy, also claiming that the noncontestable clause controls over the suicide clause. While we have serious doubts as to respondents\\u2019 right to raise these questions at this time, in any event we think this court, in Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Fishback, 171 Wash. 244, 17 P. (2d) 841, has answered the questions raised, contrary to respondents\\u2019 contention. See, also, Wright v. Philadelphia Life Ins. Co., 25 F. (2d) 514.\\nFor the reasons herein given, the order granting a new trial must be, and is, reversed, with instructions to the trial court to enter judgment on the verdict.\\nBlake, C.

Stat., \\u00a7 2442, to read as follows:\\n\\u201c(1) Every person who shall take any indecent liberties with, or on the person of any female of chaste character, without her consent, shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor;\\n\\u201c(2) Every person who shall take any indecent liberties with or on the person of any female under the age of fifteen years, or make any indecent, or obscene exposure of his person, or of the person of another, whether with or without his or her consent, shall be guilty of a felony, and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state penitentiary for not more than twenty years, or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year.\\u201d Rem. Rev. Stat. (Sup.), \\u00a7 2442 [P. C. \\u00a7 9114],\\nIn March, 1939, the state filed an information against the appellant, charging as follows:\\n\\u201cHe, said Harry Markus Stuhr, in the County of King, State of Washington, on or about the 18th day of December, 1937, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously then and there did take indecent liberties with and on the person of one Jane Doe, then and there a female child under the age of fifteen years, and not then and there the wife of the said Harry Markus Stuhr.\\u201d\\nThe following is, in substance, the evidence produced by the state at the trial: Roy Mahoney, a member of the detective division of the Seattle police department, testified that, while going to lunch on that day, he noticed the defendant and a little girl, and that defendant\\u2019s actions seemed suspicious; that he followed them and saw them go into an alley; that he went around to the other end of the alley, and they were not in sight. On one side of the alley, there was a row of garages, of which all but one were padlocked. He opened the door and saw the defendant and the girl in a dark corner. The evidence as to what was taking place is so revolting that we shall not set it out in this opinion. It will be sufficient to say that, if true, it described the commission of an independent and unnatural crime. Officer Mahoney grappled with defendant, but he broke away, the officer in pursuit. During the chase, the officer fired three times, hitting the defendant on each occasion, the third shot bringing him down. The little girl, whom the officer described as being seven or eight years old, with blond hair and wearing a red coat and a blue dress, fled and was never found or identified. The defendant was \\u2022so severely wounded that it seems extraordinary that he survived.\\nOfficer Roy Davis testified that, two days later, on December 20th, defendant denied that he had done the specific act attributed to him by Officer Mahoney, but admitted another, describing it, which would, undoubtedly, constitute the taking of an indecent liberty with, and upon, the body of the child. Captain Miller, of the Seattle Police, was present at that interview and fully corroborated the testimony of Davis. Dr. Rickies, a hospital physician, testified that the defendant made the same statements to him sometime between the 22nd and 27th of December. Later, after being released from jail, the defendant told Dr. Rickies that the impulse to do such things came upon him from time to time.\\nRobert Riley heard the shots and saw the defendant running, with Officer Mahoney in pursuit. Esther Linden heard a shot and saw a man, with a revolver in his hand, running north up the alley. The defendant had passed beyond her vision. She saw the little girl running in the opposite direction. \\u201cShe was about ten to twelve years of age and had on a red coat and was blond.\\u201d\\nAlbert Wyse, a resident of the neighborhood, heard the shooting and saw the little girl running down the alley. He said she was blond, wore a red coat, and seemed ten to eleven years of age.\\nThere were one or two other witnesses called, but the above is the substance of the state\\u2019s case. When the state rested, the defendant moved to dismiss, on the ground that the state had failed to prove the crime alleged in the information. The motion was denied. The defendant then made his opening statement to the jury in person. In so doing, he, of course, did not subject himself to cross-examination. We do not know what advantage, if any, he took of this opportunity, since his statement is not in the record. He did not take the witness stand, nor was evidence offered on his behalf other than a hospital chart; this, presumably, to show that, while in the hospital, his condition was so serious that he ought not to be held accountable for what he said to the police officers and the attending physician.\\nThe appellant contends that his demurrer to the information should have been sustained. It is urged that the information was too indefinite and did not sufficiently inform him as to the crime charged.\\nThe general rule is set out in State v. Randall, 107 Wash. 695, 182 Pac. 575, to the effect that it is sufficient, in charging a crime, to follow the language of the statute. To that rule, we have recognized exceptions in the case of general statutes, such as those covering conspiracy, State v. Scollard, 126 Wash. 335, 218 Pac. 224, 32 A. L. R. 1082; forgery, State v. Kuluris, 132 Wash. 149, 231 Pac. 782; and extortion, State v. Pettett, 141 Wash. 668, 252 Pac. 104.\\nThe question here presented is: Are the words \\u201cindecent liberties,\\u201d as used in Rem. Rev. Stat. (Sup.), \\u00a7 2442, so indefinite in meaning that an information must go beyond the statute and plead the specific act or acts relied on? In so far as we are advised, the question is one of first impression in this state, but there are persuasive decisions in a number of other jurisdictions. One of the leading cases is State v. Kunz, 90 Minn. 526, 97 N. W. 131. In this opinion, it is said:\\n\\u201c. . . for the term \\u2018indecent liberties,\\u2019 when used with reference to a woman, old or young, is self-defining; and it would be as unnecessary and as indecent to allege the defendant\\u2019s particular acts as it would be, if he were charged with rape, or carnally knowing or abusing a female child under the age of consent, to set forth the evidence in the indictment.\\u201d\\nThe supreme court of Utah quoted the above excerpt from the opinion of State v. Kunz in State v. MacMillan, 46 Utah 19, 145 Pac. 833, and added:\\n\\u201cWe thoroughly agree with the Supreme Court of Minnesota that the term \\u2018indecent liberties,\\u2019 as used in the statute, is clearly self-defining. What more could be said, except to state the evidence which proves or establishes the offense? We think that every person of the most ordinary intelligence and understanding, who is familiar with merely the rudiments of the English language, understands what is meant when he, or any one else, is charged with having taken indecent liberties with the person of a child. To say more is merely to explain what was done, which, like in a charge of carnal knowledge, or of assault with intent to have carnal knowledge, is not necessary. We think the information was sufficient.\\u201d\\nThis holding is reaffirmed in State v. Therkelson, 48 Utah 629, 161 Pac. 59. See, also, People v. Hicks, 98 Mich. 86, 56 N. W. 1102; Dekelt v. People, 44 Colo. 525, 99 Pac. 330. The state cites State v. Farnham, 119 Me. 541, 112 Atl. 258, also, but, as we read the opinion, it is somewhat favorable to appellant. We are of the opinion that the information was sufficient.\\nThe appellant\\u2019s assignment as to instruction No. 2 raises a closely related question. This instruction reads as follows:\\n\\u201cThe term \\u2018indecent liberties\\u2019 is incapable of a precise legal definition. However, for the purpose of this case you are instructed that an indecent liberty is a privilege or license taken in violation of the laws of propriety, and is such an act or acts as the common sense of society would regard as indecent and improper, and offensive to modesty and delicacy.\\u201d\\nException was taken upon, the ground that the instruction did not limit the jury to any specific act and permitted each of its members to determine for himself what an indecent liberty is. It was said, in taking the exception, that the jury, or some member thereof, might believe that the mere act of walking up street with a strange girl was indecent, and, more to the point, during the oral argument, that the jury might think that the mere taking of the little girl into the garage constituted an indecent liberty. These last possibilities, however, were precluded by the next instruction, wherein the jury was told:\\n\\u201cTo convict the defendant of the crime herein charged, the State must prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt, all of the following elements:\\n\\u201c(1) That on or about the 18th day of December, 1937, the defendant Harry Markus Stuhr did take indecent liberties with and on the person of one Jane Doe; ...\\u201d (Italics ours.)\\nIt would be as difficult to accurately define \\u201cindecent liberties\\u201d as to define \\u201cfraud\\u201d or \\u201cdue process of law.\\u201d We do not know that any court has made the attempt. As we have already shown, it is held in State v. Kunz, supra, that the term is self-defining. It is said in People v. Hicks, 98 Mich. 86, 56 N. W. 1102:\\n\\u201c \\u2018Indecent and improper liberties with the person of such child\\u2019 means such liberties as the common sense of society would regard as indecent and improper. In this case, as in State v. Millard, 18 Vt. 577, it may be said that \\u2018no particular definition is given by the statute of what constitutes this crime. The indelicacy of the subject forbids it, and does not require of the court to state what particular conduct will constitute the offense. The common sense of the community, as well as the sense of decency, propriety, and morality which most people entertain, is sufficient to apply the statute to each particular case, and point out what particular conduct is rendered criminal by it.\\u2019 The prosecution in that case was for indecent exposure of the person.\\u201d\\nIt is urged upon the court that the evidence was not sufficient to prove any crime. In this connection, it is said that, in so far as can be known, some of the members of the jury may have found the defendant guilty because they believed he did the act testified to by Mahoney, while others did not believe that, but found him guilty upon the strength of his admissions while in the hospital. Hence, it is contended that, if the evidence be insufficient as to either of these acts, the verdict should be set aside. As a next step in the argument, it is contended that the evidence is insufficient to prove either act. As to the first act, the appellant invokes the rule of Fluhart v. Seattle Electric Co., 65 Wash. 291, 118 Pac. 51:\\n\\u201cOral statements, although undisputed, must yield to undisputed physical facts and conditions with which they are irreconcilable.\\u201d\\nMahoney\\u2019s testimony was undisputed. It is urged that physical facts and conditions were shown with which it is irreconcilable. We will be unable to demonstrate why we think such physical facts were not shown without relating the disgusting details. The appellant and his counsel must be content with the statement that we do not think the photograph (defendant\\u2019s exhibit 4) proves what they contend it does; and further, that it is not impossible that the defendant managed to rearrange his clothing before he encountered other witnesses. The physical facts and conditions tend to throw some doubt on Mahoney\\u2019s story, but they are by no means irreconcilable with it.\\nIn this connection, it is argued, vigorously and at some length, that Officer Mahoney\\u2019s testimony is unworthy of belief, on the theory that he was under the necessity of magnifying appellant\\u2019s offense in order to justify his having shot him three times. But that argument is two-edged. There are persons, fortunately, who, in spite of the treatment commonly accorded to police officers in criminal trials, continue to believe that police officers, as a rule, are as conscientious in the performance of their duties as other men are. Such persons might draw the inference that Mahoney must have seen the defendant committing a serious crime or he would not have shot him to prevent his escape. But all this is, of course, immaterial. Credibility is for the jury, not for the court.\\nAs to the acts admitted by the appellant while in the hospital, it is said that his statements amounted to confessions, and confessions are not alone sufficient to establish the corpus delicti, citing State v. Marselle, 43 Wash. 273, 86 Pac. 586. But the admissions or confessions do not stand alone. Mahoney testified, in addition to the major act, that appellant had one hand on the child, although he could not determine whether it was under her dress or not, and other witnesses testified that they saw the appellant and the child fleeing from the scene.\\nIt is also urged that, if, as is possible, some of the jury found the defendant guilty on the ground that he did the act testified to by Mahoney, and others, because he did the act which he admitted in the hospital, the verdict cannot be upheld. But a finding that he committed either act established his guilt of the crime charged. Suppose the two acts had been set up as the basis of separate counts, each charging the commission of the crime in a different way, and a jury had found the appellant guilty without specifying on which count they found the verdict, the verdict would have been good. State v. Talbott, 199 Wash. 431, 91 P. (2d) 1020.\\nFinally, it is assigned as error that the court gave the stock instruction as to direct and circumstantial evidence. It was excepted to on the ground that there was no circumstantial evidence in the case, and the giving of the instruction, it is urged, was unnecessary and confusing. But there was circumstantial evidence in the case, a great deal of it. For example, one of the arguments most pressed upon us on the appeal is that the physical facts, circumstances, and conditions shown completely nullified the direct evidence of Officer Mahoney. The instruction was appropriate and favorable, rather than harmful, to the appellant.\\nThe judgment and sentence appealed from is affirmed. '\\nBlake, C.

Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 2509-3 [P. C. \\u00a7 4071-3]. Dr. P. L. Sanders was also charged in the same information with having illegally made the prescriptions. The counts in the first information, in so far as these defendants are concerned, were in the same language, except as to names and dates, as the language in the informations now before us.\\nDefendants demurred to the first information, claiming that the information did not charge a crime. The demurrer was sustained by the lower court, and, the state having elected to stand on its complaint, the action was dismissed, and the state appealed. This court affirmed the judgment, on the ground of misjoinder of parties, but we specifically stated in the opinion that the information properly charged the defendants with a crime under the statute. State v. Harkness, 196 Wash. 234, 82 P. (2d) 541.\\nThe prosecuting attorney then, by separate information, charged each of the defendants with a violation of Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 2509-3. In count one of the amended information in case No. 13964, now before us, Lyle Harkness was charged as follows:\\n\\u201cThat he . . . did unlawfully and feloniously present to a druggist ... a physician\\u2019s prescription signed by one P. L. Sanders, a physician, for one half grain sulphate morphine and issued in the name of one R. C. Love, with intent by means thereof to procure from said druggist a narcotic drug . . ., to-wit, sulphate morphine; and the said defendant did then and there sign said certificate as R. C. Love and did procure from said druggist one half grain sulphate morphine; the said defendant then and there knowing said physician\\u2019s prescription to have been falsely made and forged in the name of R. C. Love ...\\u201d\\nCounts two and three of the information were in the same language as count one, except that the prescriptions were issued in the name of Jerry Donovan, and on different dates.\\nIn case No. 13965, defendant Rex Harkness was charged in three counts, in the same language as that used in the counts in the Lyle Harkness information, except that, in the Rex Harkness case, in all three counts the prescriptions were issued in the name of Ray Douglas, and on different dates.\\nA demurrer was interposed to the amended information in each case, and overruled. The defendants were granted separate trials, and thereafter Lyle Harkness, after a plea of not guilty had been entered, went to trial, and on April 14, 1939, was, by a jury, found guilty on counts one and three of the amended information.\\nUpon the return of the verdict, the prosecuting attorney immediately filed an habitual criminal charge against Lyle Harkness, by a supplemental information, using as a basis for such charge the judgment just rendered in Kitsap county, a judgment of the superior court of the state of Washington for Okanogan county, rendered June 29, 1925, wherein a person by the name of Lyle Harkness was convicted of burglary in the second degree, and a judgment rendered in the superior court for Chelan county, on March 21, 1925, wherein one Lyle Harkness was convicted of the crime of unlawfully having in his possession narcotics, with intent to sell same.\\nAfter the filing of this supplemental information, defendant was placed on trial before the same jury on the habitual criminal charge, and thereafter, on April 14, 1939, was found guilty on this charge. Alternative motion in arrest of judgment and for new trial was made and denied, and thereafter, on April 24, 1939, judgment was entered, adjudging the defendant guilty of the substantive offense and also of the habitual criminal charge, and defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment in the state penitentiary at Walla Walla. Defendant has appealed.\\nDefendant Rex Harkness, after a plea of not guilty, went to trial on the amended information in case No. 13965, and thereafter was found guilty on counts one and three of the information.\\nImmediately upon the return of the verdict in this case, habitual criminal charges were filed against Rex Harkness, by a supplemental information, and he thereafter went on trial and was convicted of this charge. As no error is based upon the conviction of this defendant on the habitual criminal charge, no further reference will be made thereto. Alternative motion in arrest of judgment and for new trial was made and denied, and on April 24, 1939, defendant was sentenced to the state penitentiary at Walla Walla for life. Defendant has appealed.\\nIt was stipulated that these two appeals would be submitted on one statement of facts and one brief.\\nThe error assigned relative to the Rex Harkness case pertains only to his conviction on the information charging him with a violation of the narcotics act.\\nThe first assignment of error is based upon the court\\u2019s refusal to sustain a demurrer to the information in each case charging a violation of the narcotics law. It is contended here, as it was contended in State v. Harkness, supra, that there is a clear distinction between the false making of an instrument and the making of a false instrument, and that the provision in Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 2509-3, that\\n\\u201c . . . any person who shall falsely make, forge or alter or knowing the same to have been falsely made, forged or altered shall present to any druggist a physician\\u2019s prescription,\\u201d\\napplied only to a false making of an instrument, as distinguished from the making of a false instrument.\\nAppellant Rex Harkness admits that the evidence is sufficient to prove that he signed the name of Ray Douglas to the prescription referred to in counts one and three, and admits that these particular prescriptions were made out to him in the name of Ray Douglas.\\nAppellant Lyle Harkness admits that the prescription referred to in count one was made out to him in the name of R. C. Love, and was signed and endorsed by him as R. C. Love; and admits that the prescription referred to in count three was made out to Jerry Donovan, for Jerry Donovan, and that appellant signed the name of Jerry Donovan on the prescription.\\nRem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 2509-3, in so far as pertinent, provides:\\n\\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to sell, furnish, or dispose of, or have in his possession with intent to sell, furnish, or dispose of any narcotic drug or drugs, except upon the written and signed prescription of a physician regularly licensed to practice medicine and surgery who has complied with the regulations of, and is duly registered under the laws of the state of Washington, and the laws of the Congress of the United States. All such prescriptions shall be written with ink or indelible pencil, must be signed by the physician issuing the same, and must contain the name and address of the person for whom prescribed . . .\\n\\u201cAny person violating any of, the provisions of this section and any person who shall falsely make, forge or alter or knowing the same to have been falsely made, forged or altered shall present to any druggist a physician\\u2019s prescription with intent by means thereof to procure from such druggist any narcotic drug as defined in this act shall be guilty of a felony, . . . \\u201d\\nThe contention made herein by appellant under assignment of error No. 1 was presented in the former case of State v. Harkness, supra, and we there held the information properly charged a crime. We are satisfied with our former decision, and we are therefore of the opinion the information in each of the cases being considered herein 'charged a crime, and that the trial court properly overruled the demurrer in each case.\\nUnder assignment of error No. 2, appellant Rex Harkness claims the court erred in refusing to give requested instruction No. 5, and under assignment of error No. 3, this appellant contends the court erred in refusing to give requested instruction No. 11.\\nAppellant Lyle Harkness, under the fourth and fifth assignments of error, contends the court erred in refusing to give requested instructions Nos. 4 and 9.\\nAssignment of error No. 6 is based upon the exclusion by the court of evidence to prove that Dr. P. L. Sanders was treating the appellants in the course of his professional practice, and that the narcotics were obtained for their personal use in pursuance of such treatment.\\nInstruction No. 5, as requested by appellant Rex Harkness, is the same as instruction No. 4 requested by appellant Lyle Harkness, and is as follows:\\n\\u201cI instruct you that the word \\u2018patient\\u2019 means one who applies to a physician for the alleviation of pain or disease.\\n\\u201cIt is the duty of a physician to relieve the pain and suffering of his patient when such relief can be effected by the use of morphine in quantity proportionate to the needs of such patient.\\n\\u201cIn this case there is a presumption that the defendant, P. L. Sanders, as a physician was acting in the course of his practice as a doctor, and that he was prescribing morphine for a legitimate purpose, and before this presumption can be overcome you must be satisfied by competent evidence to the contrary beyond any reasonable doubt.\\u201d\\nInstruction No. 11, as requested by appellant Rex Harkness, is the same as instruction No. 9 requested by appellant Lyle Harkness, and provides:\\n\\u201cIt is not the purpose or intent of the law to prohibit physicians from administering morphine to their patients, or to establish any hard, fast or legitimate rule by which the judgment of the physicians in such cases is to be governed.\\n\\u201cIn administering morphine to his patients, the law requires that the physician, in the course of his professional practice, only administer it for legitimate purposes and in such quantities as are proportionate to the needs of the patient. The law requires that the physician shall act in good faith. He is not required or expected to withhold his services, advice and assistance from his patient under penalty of being convicted for an error of judgment. While on the other hand, he is not permitted to use his profession as a subterfuge for unlawfully disposing of morphine.\\u201d\\nWe think the trial court properly refused to give the requested instructions and properly excluded the evidence of treatment by Dr. Sanders. Appellants\\u2019 contention, in effect, is that, because they are narcotic addicts, they had a right to procure the issuance of prescriptions in false and fictitious names, and thereafter, by endorsing the false and fictitious names, procure the drug. We do not think any such act is contemplated or authorized by the statutes, or that one, because he is such an addict, has any more right to procure morphine by such a false prescription, even though it be issued by a doctor from whom he is taking treatment, than any other person. The law prescribes the manner in which narcotic drugs may be procured, and plainly, we think, appellants, when they procured a prescription to be issued to a fictitious person, and then endorsed that name on the prescription to obtain the drug, violated the statute. We so stated in State v. Harkness, supra.\\nAn addict is not, by this statute, deprived of obtaining, in a proper manner, such amounts of morphine as a physician may deem necessary for his well being.\\nAppellant Lyle Harkness contends the court erred in refusing to give requested instruction No. 7, which reads as follows:\\n\\u201cIt is not the purpose or intent of the law to deprive morphine from those who are entitled to its use. The narcotic law of the state of Washington is not aimed at the use of drugs by those whose treatment requires that they obtain the drug. The state narcotic law is intended as a regulation to prevent the obtaining of narcotics either by those who are not entitled to obtain them, or by those who intend to obtain the drugs for the purpose of sale.\\u201d\\nUnder this assignment and assignment No. 8, appellants again contend that they were guilty of no crime in having procured narcotics for their own use, even though procured by them under names not their own.\\nWhat we have said herein we think also answers this contention. The statute authorizes narcotic drugs to be procured in only one way, and this regardless of who the person is or what his condition may be. As we have stated, this statute does not prevent a physician from administering to a patient such quantities of morphine or other drugs as his needs may require. We think the trial court properly refused to give requested instruction No. 7.\\nIt is next contended by appellant Lyle Harkness that the court erred in giving instruction No. 6, and in refusing to give requested instruction No. 12.\\nBy instruction No. 6, the jury were told that even though there was a person by the name of Jerry Donovan, if they found that the prescription made out in the name of Jerry Donovan was used and presented by appellant, and that he used the name of Jerry Donovan in procuring such prescription, and himself procured narcotics thereunder, then Jerry Donovan, for the purpose of such prescription, was a false and fictitious name.\\nRequested instruction No. 12 provides:\\n\\u201cIf you find that Dr. P. L. Sanders made out the prescription as alleged in count III in the name of Jerry Dono van. and intended that the said prescription should be presented and indorsed by Jerry Donovan, and if you further find that Lyle Harkness presented the prescription for Jerry Donovan and obtained the narcotics for him then you must find the defendant not guilty as to count III.\\u201d\\nIt is contended by appellant that the prescription was made out for Jerry Donovan, and that appellant signed the prescription as agent for Jerry Donovan, and procured the drug for Jerry Donovan.\\nEven if we should concede, which we do not, that narcotic drugs could be procured in this way, still there is no evidence to support this claim of agency.\\nIt appears from the testimony of Mr. Ames, the druggist who filled this prescription, that it was presented by appellant Lyle Harkness, whom he knew as Jerry Donovan, and that appellant signed the name of Jerry Donovan to the prescription and procured the drug.\\nIt appears from the testimony of Dr. Sanders, who signed this prescription, that he had known appellant Lyle Harkness sixteen or seventeen years; that he was treating appellant and his brother Rex, and that they requested him not to write their names in the prescriptions, but to write in names they would furnish him; that he had made out other prescriptions in the name of Jerry Donovan, and had given them to appellant Lyle Harkness. It does not appear from the testimony that he was requested by Jerry Donovan to make out this prescription, or that he was ever told it was for Jerry Donovan. The doctor did, however, finally state: \\u201cWell, he was acting as Donovan\\u2019s agent or friend.\\u201d It also appears that the doctor had once treated a man by the name of Jerry Donovan.\\nWe think it apparent from this testimony that there was no evidence which would have warranted the court in giving the requested instruction. We are of the opinion instruction No. 6, as given, was correct, and that the court properly refused to give requested instruction No. 12.\\nThe last assignment of error is based upon the refusal of the court to withdraw from the consideration of the jury the habitual criminal charge. We think this contention must be sustained.\\nThe habitual criminal charge was based upon the conviction of the narcotics charge and two claimed prior convictions, one purporting to be a judgment of conviction on the charge of burglary, rendered by the superior court for Okanogan county, the other being a judgment of conviction by the superior court for Chelan county on a narcotics charge. The conviction in the case now before us and the Chelan county conviction were admitted, but the conviction in Okanogan county was denied. The plea of not guilty to the habitual criminal charge put in issue, and required the state to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, all the necessary elements of the habitual criminal charge. It certainly was necessary that the state not only prove that there was a judgment rendered in Okanogan county, such as referred to in the supplemental information, but also that the Lyle Harkness therein named was the same person as the Lyle Harkness on trial in this action.\\nA certified copy of the Okanogan county judgment, which showed the conviction of a person by the name of Lyle Harkness, was admitted in evidence in this case. The only testimony, in addition to the identity of names, which it is claimed tended to prove that the Lyle Harkness named in the Okanogan county judgment and this appellant are the same person, is a claimed admission made by appellant when testifying in behalf of his brother Rex Harkness, in the action wherein Rex was defendant.\\nWe have carefully examined the testimony of appellant, as read into the record by the reporter from her notes taken in the Rex Harkness trial, and we are of the opinion there is nothing in that testimony tending to show that this appellant is the same person as the Lyle Harkness named in the Okanogan county judgment.\\nWe are also of the opinion this testimony was not admissible in the instant case, under our decision in Duffy v. Blake, 91 Wash. 140, 157 Pac. 480.\\nNeither do we think it was proper for the reporter to read her notes into the record. Duffy v. Blake, supra; Davis v. Associated Fruit Co., 135 Wash. 614, 238 Pac. 629; Preston v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 198 Wash. 157, 87 P. (2d) 475. State v. Lindsey, 150 Wash. 121, 272 Pac. 72, is not applicable herein, as, in the cited case, the admission claimed to have been made by Lindsey was made upon cross-examination in his own case.\\nCounsel for appellant moved for a directed verdict at the close of the state\\u2019s case, contending there was a failure of proof that appellant was the same person as the Lyle Harkness named in the Okanogan county judgment, and that identity of names was not sufficient to prove identity of the person.\\nIt is difficult to determine from the record on just what the court based its action in denying appellant\\u2019s motion, but it seems to have been upon the theory that the trial court was of the opinion that the name of appellant being the same as the name in the Okanogan county judgment, when considered in connection with appellant\\u2019s claimed admission, was sufficient proof of identity of the person to go to the jury. We believe this is the first case in which the question has been squarely presented to this court, of whether or not identity of names alone is sufficient proof of a former judgment of conviction to warrant the trial court in submitting that question to the jury, where the former judgment inheres in and increases the penalty of the substantive crime charged. We have had before us two cases touching this question in some measure, but in both of these cases there was some testimony admitted and held competent and material, in addition to the identity of names.\\nIn State v. Le Pitre, 54 Wash. 166, 103 Pac. 27, the record of the former conviction was received without objection. It is also stated in the opinion that a witness competent to testify proved the identity of appellant.\\nIn State v. Magnusson, 128 Wash. 541, 223 Pac. 325, the judgments of prior convictions were held properly admitted, but it appears therein that, upon cross-examination, appellant admitted that he had been twice convicted prior to the case on trial. The question was asked and answered without objection. In the cited case, however, we stated:\\n\\u201cIf previous convictions of unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor had the legal effect of aggravating the felony of bootlegging into a higher crime, calling for a greater punishment than the single offense of bootlegging, it may well be doubted that this attempted proof of appellant\\u2019s two previous convictions was sufficient to identify him as the persons previously so convicted.\\u201d\\nSee, also, State v. Dale, 115 Wash. 466, 197 Pac. 645.\\nThere are two lines of decisions, one holding that identity of names alone is sufficient to make a prima facie case of identity of the person, the other holding that identity of names alone is not sufficient proof of identity of person to warrant the court in submitting to the jury a prior judgment of conviction, but that, in addition to the identity of names, it must be shown, by evidence independent of the record of former conviction, that the person whose former conviction is proved is the' defendant in the present action. We think the latter is the better rule, and supported by the weight of authority.\\n\\u201cThe record of a former conviction is not sufficient .alone to show that defendant in the present prosecution was formerly convicted. It must be shown by evidence independent of the record of the former conviction that the person whose former conviction is proved is the defendant in the present prosecution.

Smith, 129 Iowa 709, 106 N. W. 187, 4 L. R. A. (N.

Every fact essential to the infliction of legal punishment upon a human being must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. And it would amount to a travesty to say that a prima facie case for an increased term of punishment could be made out against John Smith, being tried in Linn county, by showing isolated facts that' a man passing under that name had at some time or other been convicted in the courts of Lee county.\\u201d\\nState v.

Co. v. Ernst, 199 Wash. 176, 91 P. (2d) 718.\\nRespondent undertook this litigation by reason of a ruling made by the unemployment compensation division of the department of social security to the effect that carriers distributing papers for respondent were employees as defined by Laws of 1937, chapter 162, p. 610, \\u00a719, subd. (g), Rem. Rev. Stat. (Sup.), \\u00a7 9998-119 [P. C. \\u00a7 6233-317]. The ruling was challenged by respondent by the bringing of this action under the declaratory judgment act. The trial court entered a decree to the effect that the carriers in question were independent contractors and not employees of respondent under the provisions of the state unemployment compensation act. Costs in the superior court were awarded against appellants.\\nOn appeal, we affirmed the judgment of the superior court except that portion relating to costs. In disposing of appellants\\u2019 contention that the trial court erred in awarding costs against the state, we said:\\n\\u201cWhile this action was necessitated by the view of the law taken by appellants, thereby forcing respondent to litigation to have its rights ascertained, and it would be equitable to impose costs to be paid out of the unemployment compensation administration fund, the action was brought by the respondent against state officers in their official capacities; consequently, the action in effect is one against the state, and the award to the respondent of its costs and disbursements is an award of costs against the state. We have consistently held that, in the absence of statutory authority therefor, costs may not be assessed against the state. We know of no authority for assessing costs against the appellants; and to that extent, the judgment is erroneous.\\u201d\\nThe question of costs upon appeal was not decided.\\nBecause appellants subsequently filed a petition for rehearing, the clerk of this court made no immediate ruling upon the bill filed by respondent for costs upon appeal. After the rehearing was denied, respondent filed a supplemental cost bill to cover the expense of printing the answer to the petition for rehearing which had been requested by this court. Appellants took exception as to each cost bill, and September 22, 1939, the clerk of this court denied the costs on both bills.\\nThe general rules governing allowance of costs are well established. That costs are a creature of statute is beyond question.\\n\\u201cAt common law costs were not recoverable eo nomine . . . Costs can therefore be imposed and recovered only in cases where there is statutory authority therefor, and where the party claiming costs comes within the operation of the statutory provision relating to costs. The courts have no power to adjudge costs as against anyone on mere equitable or moral grounds.\\u201d 15 C. J. 21, \\u00a7 3.\\nThe following statement relating to cost statutes appears in 2 Lewis\\u2019 Sutherland on Statutory Construction (2d ed.), 1306, \\u00a7718:\\n\\u201cStatutes allowing costs, it was ruled at an early day, should be taken strictly, as being a kind of penalty. This reason is not strictly correct. Costs are compensatory to the prevailing party; they are allowed him to make his remedy more adequate. The liability to pay them is created by statute, because the party so made liable has furnished the occasion for incurring these costs. The obligation extends no further than it is plainly declared by the authority which creates it. \\u2018Costs are only recoverable when there is statutory authority awarding them.\\u2019 Statutes imposing costs are strictly construed as penal in their nature and as creating liabilities which did not exist at common law. The allowance of costs turns on the interpretation of the terms of the statutes and the intention deduced therefrom, and neither costs nor salaries can be given or increased by construction or in any indirect manner beyond the amount specified by law.\\u201d\\nIn Meade v. French, 4 Wash. 11, 29 Pac. 833, this court said:\\n\\u201cCosts are purely statutory, and can only be awarded where the statute gives them.\\u201d\\nIn Pierce County v. Magnuson, 70 Wash. 639, 127 Pac. 302, Ann. Cas. 1914B, 889, it was stated:\\n\\u201cThe awarding and payment of costs is purely a matter of statutory regulation. The recovery of costs was unknown to the common law, and no provision could be made for their payment except as expressly authorized by statute. This rule has been one of such universal application that it has become the settled doctrine of the courts that costs are the creature of statute merely, and that the allowance of them in any case would depend entirely upon the terms of some statute. It has also been held that there is no inherent power in the courts to award costs, and that they can be granted in any case or proceeding solely by virtue of express statutory authority. 5 Ency. Plead. & Prac., 110. In Coggill v. Lawrence, 2 Blatchf. (U. S.) 304, it was held that neither party can recover costs upon any equity in the case; nor does the court possess authority to award them as an incident of its power over the parties or the subject-matter of the litigation.\\u201d\\nSee, also, Perlus v. Silver, 71 Wash. 338, 128 Pac. 661; Eggerth v. Spokane, 91 Wash. 221, 157 Pac. 859; Nelson v. Industrial Ins. Department, 104 Wash. 204, 176 Pac. 15; Alberta Lumber Co. v. Pioneer Lumber Co., 138 Wash. 132, 244 Pac. 250; Victor Products Corp. v. Edwards, 172 Wash. 1, 18 P. (2d) 1045; and King County v. Seattle, 195 Wash. 293, 80 P. (2d) 838.\\nThe following rules are directed to the situation where, as here, the state is a party to the litigation and the question relates to costs on appeal.\\nIn 14 Am. Jur. 22, \\u00a7 34, this rule is stated:\\n\\u201cA sovereign state, in suits to which it is a party in its own courts, is not liable for costs in the absence of an express statute creating such liability.\\u201d\\nReferring again to Corpus Juris, we find this statement:\\n\\u201cThe right to costs of appeal or writ of error are dependent solely on statute. In the absence of special statutory authorization such costs cannot be allowed.\\u201d 15 C. J. 239, \\u00a7 594.\\nOur attention has been directed to the following sections of Rem. Rev. Stat., as having a bearing upon the allowance of costs against the state:\\n\\u00a7 886 [P. C. \\u00a7 6260]. \\u201cAny person or corporation having any claim against the state of Washington shall have a right of action against the state in the superior court of Thurston county. . . . \\u201d\\n\\u00a7 889 [P. C. \\u00a7 6263]. \\u201cNo execution shall issue against the state on any judgment, but whenever a final judgment against the state shall have been obtained in any such action, the clerk shall make and furnish to the auditor of state a duly certified transcript of such judgment; and the auditor of state shall thereupon audit the amount of damages and costs therein awarded, and the same shall be paid out of the state treasury.\\u201d\\n\\u00a7 491 [P. C. \\u00a7 7472]. \\u201cIn all actions prosecuted in the name and for the use of the state, or in the name and for the use of any county, the state or county shall be liable for costs in the same case and to the same extent as private parties.\\u201d\\n\\u00a7 493 [P. C. \\u00a7 7474]. \\u201cIn all actions and proceedings other than those mentioned in this chapter, where no provision is made for the recovery of costs, they may be allowed or not; and if allowed, may be apportioned between the parties, in the discretion of the. court.\\u201d\\nRespondent urges that this action is of the character mentioned in \\u00a7 886 and that the necessary statutory authority for the allowance of costs against the state may be found in the language of \\u00a7 889. The section last mentioned does no more than make provision for the manner in which recovery may be had for \\u201cthe amount of damages and costs\\u201d awarded in a judgment obtained against the state. No direct authorization for the allowance of costs against the state on appeal can be derived from the bare reference to costs in the description of the method to be employed in collecting them after they have been awarded. Section 889 is of assistance to the successful adversary of the state only in the event that specific statutory authorization for the granting of costs can be established from some other source.\\nIt is next contended by respondent that, under the provisions of \\u00a7 493, this court may, in its discretion, award costs against the state. It is manifest that the situation presented by the case at bar, in which the state was defendant in the superior court, does not fall within that group of cases wherein costs are allowable against the state under the provisions of \\u00a7 491. Section 491 plainly describes the only situation in which costs may be awarded against the state; that is, where the action is \\u201cprosecuted in the name and for the use of the state.\\u201d Section 493 cannot be employed to furnish express statutory authority for the granting of costs against the state. That section of the statute relates only to costs in cases between private individuals.\\nWe have also considered the provisions of Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 1744 [P. C. \\u00a7 7329], which relates to costs on appeal, but do not find therein any specific statutory authorization for allowing costs against the state.\\nRespondent argues that when, as in the instant case, the state, as defendant, prosecutes an appeal from an adverse judgment in the trial court, it thereby becomes the plaintiff in the action for the purposes of the appeal, and is liable for costs under \\u00a7 491 if the appeal proves unsuccessful. In support of this proposition, respondent cites Romine v. State, 7 Wash. 215, 34 Pac. 924. It is true that the facts in the Romine case are somewhat analogous to those with which we are now concerned. Romine, as plaintiff, obtained judgment against the state in the trial court with respect to title to certain school lands. The state prosecuted an unsuccessful appeal to this court after judgment had been entered against it in the trial court. Considering the question of costs, this court stated:\\n\\u201cThe statute does not authorize the assessment of costs against the state, and none should have been allowed. The state has never been in fault in these matters, but it has graciously allowed a suit to be brought that the landholder might secure further assurance of his title. It is all to his advantage, and he ought to pay the expense of the proceeding. But it was different when the state appealed, and thereby put itself in the wrong. . . .\\n\\u201cRespondent will recover costs of the appeal only against the state.\\u201d\\nThe case of State ex rel. Dill v. Martin, 45 Wash. 76, 87 Pac. 1054, presents another instance in which costs in this court were allowed against the state to the prevailing parties on appeal. This case is not in point. While the court did not mention the statute in its decision, it stated:\\n\\u201cSuch costs should not, however, be charged against the relators, but against the state on whose relation, in whose behalf, and for whose benefit alone the rela-tors acted, and at whose instance the erroneous judgment was entered.\\u201d\\nWe are unable to follow the ruling in the cases just cited, for the reason that the statutes relative to the costs on appeal were not considered or applied. Moreover, the holdings were contrary to the unanimous weight of authority.\\nWe hold in conformity with the recognized general rule that costs may not be taxed against the state in an action brought against it until the legislature, by express statutory provision, provides for such taxation, and, inasmuch as there is now no express statutory authority for taxing costs against the state, we must deny the motion for the retaxation of costs.\\nIt is so ordered.\\nBlake, C.

The injury suffered was a wrenched back and torn ligaments of the left leg, caused when respondent\\u2019s heel slipped from a worn step while he was walking down a flight of stairs in a dry kiln. He filed his claim for compensation with the department of labor and industries, and October 26, 1935, an allowance was made for time loss and temporary total disability to September 20, 1935. Shortly thereafter, respondent returned to work and continued his employment until May 15, 1937.\\nMay 27,1937, he made application to reopen his claim for the purpose of receiving further allowance for permanent partial disability, contending that his injury of August 24, 1935, had become so aggravated that he could no longer follow a gainful occupation. The supervisor of industrial insurance rejected the claim on June 9, 1937. June 17, 1937, respondent appealed to the joint board, which resulted in a hearing before that body. The joint board, April 4, 1938, sustained the order of the supervisor.\\nRespondent appealed to the superior court and, after hearing, obtained a judgment reversing the order of the joint board. The department of labor and industries appeals. The department contends that the court erred in reversing the joint board and in finding that respondent was entitled to a pension for total permanent disability.\\nThe record discloses that respondent had worked steady since the autumn of 1935, except for two short periods, one when he took a trip east and another when he was ill with influenza. He testified that he did not suffer pain until his injury, and after that time the pain was almost continuous up until the time of the hearing.\\nThe question for determination is whether or not his impaired physical condition was caused by his injury.\\nIn approaching the problem, we must bear in mind that our statute, Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 7697 [P. C. \\u00a7 3488], provides:\\n\\u201c . . . In all court proceedings under or pursuant to this act the decision of the department shall be prima facie correct and the burden of proof shall be upon the party attacking the same. ...\\u201d\\nand that, when a complainant appeals to the courts, he assumes and must meet the burden of proving that he sustained an injury compensable under the statute. Ferguson v. Department of Labor & Industries, 197 Wash. 524, 85 P. (2d) 1072, 90 P. (2d) 280.\\nIn determining whether the existing physical condition of a claimant is attributable to a preexisting disease or congenital infirmity, a finding of fact based upon the testimony of skilled and professional men, when reasonably supported, will not be disturbed.\\nIn Kavaja v. Department of Labor & Industries, 126 Wash. 284, 218 Pac. 196, this court stated:\\n\\u201cWhile the testimony of appellant and other non-expert witnesses has some bearing on the question involved, yet, in the main, the actual facts must be determined from the testimony of the medical witnesses.\\u201d\\nThe supreme court of Oklahoma in Fain Drilling Co. v. Deatherage, 179 Okla. 409, 65 P. (2d) 1212, and Atlantic Refining Co. v. Allen, 90 P. (2d) (Okla.) 659, stated:\\n\\u201cWhere, in a proceeding before the Industrial Commission, the disability alleged to exist is of such character as to require skilled and professional men to determine the cause and extent thereof, the question is one of science and must necessarily be proved by the testimony of skilled professional persons, and a finding of fact based thereon when reasonably supported will not be disturbed.\\u201d\\nSee, also, Stevich v. Department of Labor & Industries, 182 Wash. 401, 47 P. (2d) 32; McGrady v. Brink, 195 Wash. 626, 81 P. (2d) 800; Hoff v. Department of Labor & Industries, 198 Wash. 257, 88 P. (2d) 419.\\nA commission consisting of Drs. C. J. Sells, J. L. Norris, and J. F. Christensen made a thorough examination of respondent June 22, 1937, and later testified at the hearing before the joint board. Their testimony is as contained in their written findings as follows:\\n\\u201cOnly complaint is pain in lumbar region of back when bending or on pressure over 2nd & 3rd vertebrae. Looks well nourished. Weight 164 lbs. without coat. Height 67% inches. Posture\\u2014Stooping. Shoulder blades prominent, slight scoliosis to left in lumbar region. A very marked lordosis, from 10th dorsal to 5th lumbar vertebrae. Walks with stiff (poker) back.\\n\\u201cForward and backward bending normal. Can come within 4 inches of touching floor with finger tips on forward bending. Lateral movements of back and hip normal. Leg raising normal in every way. Reflexes are normal. Rhomberg negative. Co-ordination normal.\\n\\u201cBlood pressure abnormally high. S.182 D.90. Heart and lungs normal. Prostate normal. Urine negative.\\n\\u201cWears a canvas belt 8 in. wide around hips but is very loose and apparently does no good.\\n\\u201cIs not under treatment.\\n\\u201cX-ray of dorsal and lumbar spine shows no evidence of injury. Marked scoliosis to left. Lateral view shows very pronounced forward curvature of all lumbar vertebrae. The surfaces between 4th & 5th lumbar vertebrae are irregular and rough, almost obliterating the normal space. Fifth lumbar vertebrae has a congenital defect evidently a spina bifida with foramen in body of same.\\n\\u201cConclusion: There is a sacralization of 5th lumbar vertebrae and sacrum. There is a bony fusion of 10th, 11th and 12th dorsal and 1st lumbar vertebrae due to preexisting arthritis.\\n\\u201cHis condition is fixed. No further treatment is indicated. There is no disability as a result of accident in question, it is due to pre-existing congenital and arthritic condition of the spine.\\u201d\\nDr. C. J. Sells, called as a witness on behalf of respondent, who had examined him on two occasions, testified:\\n\\u201cWell, it is my opinion that arthritis\\u2014we were talking strictly about arthritis\\u2014it is my opinion that arthritis isn\\u2019t itself either improved or aggravated by an injury, but anyone who has arthritis is much more subject to so-called strains and pain as a result of having had this arthritis. In other words, a man who has arthritis, hypertrophic arthritis, as this man has, it is nearly always due to a focal infection some place in their body, causing a throwing out of spurring of bone and increased amount of calcium deposits into the tissue. Now, the accident didn\\u2019t make any part of that. Also, he has a congenital deformity since birth and that congenital deformity since birth might be the cause, and probably is the cause, of the direct fusion of the 5th lumbar onto the sacrum; but a man who has that kind of a back may not be suffering much pain and some minor accident may produce pain, which is a long time in leaving, which may be weeks and may be several years before the pain from that particular injury clears up. But it isn\\u2019t my opinion that the injury made the arthritis worse.\\u201d\\nCounsel for respondent has not cited any case, but contents himself with the argument that the doctors were wrong in their conclusions. We are unable to accede to that conclusion. The physicians were very frank in the giving of their testimony and evidenced a desire to be entirely fair to respondent, and their testimony clearly indicated that respondent\\u2019s existing physical condition was not occasioned by the injury.\\nThe judgment is reversed.\\nMain, Beals, Millard, Steinert, Geraghty, Robinson, and Jeffers, JJ., concur.\", \"type\": \"majority\", \"author\": \"Simpson, J.\"}, {\"text\": \"Blake, C.

Columbia Clinic, Inc., Respondent.\"], \"opinions\": [{\"text\": \"Geraghty, J.\\nThis action was brought by the plaintiff, individually and as administratrix of the estate of her son, Donald Burnham, to recover for financial loss sustained by her by reason of the death of her son, alleged to have resulted from the defendant\\u2019s negligent treatment of him while in its clinic as a patient. The plaintiff, in her complaint, asked for damages in the sum of twenty-five hundred dollars for herself, a like sum for the deceased\\u2019s estate, and the further sum of $446.04 for funeral expenses. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for the exact amount asked for funeral expenses, and the defendant moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The motion was granted, followed by the entry of a judgment of dismissal. The plaintiff appeals.\\nSaturday night, January 30, 1937, shortly after seven o\\u2019clock, the deceased, eighteen years of age, was riding in a car driven by Loren Forsman; a third young man was riding with them. As the car was driven along a street in the vicinity of Lake Sacajawea, in Longview, it was deflected from its course by a button in the roadway, struck a telegraph pole, and plunged into the lake.\\nThe car overturned and came to rest in water about waist high, with its wheels in the air. The night was cold, and the lake was covered with a thin sheet of ice. After extricating himself from the overturned car, Forsman went to the aid of the deceased, who was under water. He was unable to get him out of the car, but held his head above the water until assistance came. The deceased was hurried to the respondent\\u2019s clinic, where he died on the morning of the second day thereafter. The death certificate states that the cause of his death was \\u201cPulmonary edema and circulatory failure due to injury and inhalation of muddy water into lungs.\\u201d\\nThe acts of negligence alleged in the complaint were that the respondent did not make any attempt to diagnose deceased\\u2019s injuries, but placed him, while still unconscious, on a bed in a ward near an open window, in extremely cold weather, his body being only partially covered, and that death was. caused wholly by the carelessness and negligence of the clinic.\\nThe appellant testified that, on reaching the clinic; she found her son in bed, out on the porch in the solarium.\\n\\u201cDr. Steward was sewing up his leg. I asked the doctor not to give him any anesthetics. His body was frozen hard and he was unconscious. The nurse said he had received such a shock it would not be necessary in sewing up the cut on his leg and forehead. The doctor sewed up the cut on his head. There was no other doctor in the room or in the building. I called Dr. Hackett and asked him to come over and take charge of Don and do his best for him. Dr. Hackett said he would come. When he got there he examined him and said the boy was not in any danger and that there was nothing for me to worry about. They did not pump the boy\\u2019s stomach out. Dr. Hackett said I could go home as there was nothing I could dp there and they would call me if there was any change in Don\\u2019s condition. Before I left they moved Don into room 203. They put him in the bed next to the window. The wind was blowing and his head was wet. He was not well covered and constantly kicked the covers off. The door opened at the foot of his bed. They had to come in and go out that way. It was drafty in there with the door and window open at the same time. They brought the oxygen in about an hour after I came in. Dr. Steward was in and out of the room. They had a special nurse come in at 11:00 o\\u2019clock. . . . He was just ice-cold. He had one hot water bottle at his feet. I would close the window and the nurse would open it. The water Don threw up was thick and muddy. There were small rocks and gravel and muddy water in what he threw up. He filled up one of the pans and it ran over onto the bed. They started giving him oxygen about 10:30. He regained consciousness about 2:30. The first thing he said was, \\u2018Take that thing off my nose, will you?\\u2019 They raised it off just a minute. He seemed to rest and then all of a sudden he would seem to sink away. He tried to sit up in bed and would stand up and they put him in a strait-jacket.\\u201d\\nShe testified that her son was not given anything to eat or drink until Sunday afternoon; that his nightshirt \\u201cwas open in front and he could throw the covers off and they left him by that open window all the time.\\u201d A special nurse was in charge. Sunday morning, Dr. Hackett ordered a pneumonia jacket, and the nurse said she would put one on. Appellant remained with her son until 11:30 Sunday night, and no pneumonia jacket had been put on during that time. Dr. Hackett told her that a stomach pump was not necessary.\\nAppellant\\u2019s brother testified that the head of the patient\\u2019s bed was within sixteen or eighteen inches of the window, with no screen between. He heard Dr. Hackett tell the nurse to put on a pneumonia jacket. She put a towel on him and pinned it on one side.\\nForsman, the driver, who, following the accident, had pleaded guilty to a manslaughter charge, testified that he called on the deceased at the clinic the morning after the accident and found him \\u201clying there laughing and smiling and said he \\u2018sure felt swell.\\u2019 \\u201d\\nThe appellant\\u2019s evidence, in as far as it tended to show any lack of care in the treatment of the deceased, was contradicted by evidence produced by the respondent, which tended to show that the care and treatment given by its staff was in accordance with approved methods. But, on a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, in determining whether a case was made for the jury, we are to consider the evidence in the view most favorable to the appellant.\\nThe question is not whether the respondent\\u2019s treatment of the deceased was proper and adequate under the circumstances, but whether there is any substantial evidence, or inference from the evidence, from which reasonable minds could conclude that the respondent\\u2019s failure to properly treat the deceased, admitting improper treatment, was the cause of his death; not necessarily the certain cause, but the most probable cause.\\nIn Hessler v. Moore, 188 Wash. 80, 61 P. (2d) 1001, in affirming a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the court said:\\n\\u201cThe rule of law has long been settled in this state. Very recently, it was expressed as follows:\\n\\u201c \\u2018It is undoubtedly true that, -in determining the cause of a death for which recovery is sought, the jury may not speculate or conjecture as between several causes. That is to say, where the evidence goes no further than to show that death may have resulted from one of several causes, for one or more of which there is liability, and for another or others of which there is none, then the jury cannot speculate or conjecture and return a verdict as for a cause for which there is liability.\\u2019 Hill v. Great Northern Life Ins. Co., 186 Wash. 167,- 57 P. (2d) 405.\\n\\u201cThe language just quoted may be supplemented by the following:\\n\\u201c \\u2018A plaintiff in this character of case is not obligated to establish the material facts essential to a recovery beyond a reasonable doubt. Such a rule would amount to a denial of justice. It is sufficient if his evidence affords room for men of reasonable minds to conclude that there is a greater probability that the accident causing the injury happened in such a way as to fix liability upon the person charged with such liability, than it is that it happened in a way for which the person so charged would not be liable.\\u2019 St. Germain v. Potlatch Lumber Co., 76 Wash. 102, 135 Pac. 804.\\n\\u201cThese two extracts read together seem to fairly state the law on this question.\\u201d\\nConsidering the desperate state of the deceased when he was brought to the clinic, can it be said that the evidence affords room for men of reasonable minds to conclude that there was a greater probability that death resulted from the respondent\\u2019s negligent care of the deceased; or, stating the question in another way, a greater probability that death would not have resulted but for the lack of proper treatment?\\nWe do not think reasonable minds could so conclude. The jury\\u2019s verdict, in awarding the appellant her out-of-pocket funeral expenses only and nothing for loss sustained by reason of her son\\u2019s death, would seem to indicate that the jury was not strongly impressed with the strength of her case.\\nIn view of what we have already said, it is unnecessary to discuss the appellant\\u2019s further assignment of error, based upon the trial court\\u2019s denial of her motion for an increase of the jury\\u2019s award in the additional sum of fifteen hundred dollars.\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\nBlake, C.

The defendant relied upon the statute of limitations as a defense to the action. The facts are stipulated and, as they relate to the acquisition of the fifty shares of stock by the defendant, are as follows:\\nIn June, 1907, Clark Ring, father of the defendant, transferred twenty-five shares of the bank stock to Jessie Ring (who is now Jessie Ring Garrett and the defendant here), for which a stock certificate was issued and a receipt therefor given.\\nOn November 6, 1911, Jessie Ring, having married Garrett, signed a written assignment whereby the shares were transferred to the name of Jessie Ring Garrett. A new certificate was thereupon issued by the bank for the twenty-five shares in the name of Jessie Ring Garrett, for which a receipt was given.\\nThe certificates referred to were all on standard stock certificate forms. The receipts vary slightly, but are all substantially in the following form: \\u201cReceived of Bank of Saginaw Certificate No..............................., representing ..............................shares of the capital stock of said Bank. ..........................................................................................

Defendant thereby was entitled to an additional twenty-five shares of stock, and the bank thereupon issued to her a new certificate representing fifty shares, for which the defendant gave a signed receipt to the bank.\\nIn 1928, the bank again increased its capitalization, and each shareholder was given the privilege of purchasing one share for each four held. Defendant, by written instrument, on May 12, 1928, applied for the additional thirteen shares to which she was thereby entitled, thereafter sent a check to the bank in payment of the thirteen shares, and asked that a certificate be issued therefor. The bank thereupon issued to her a certificate covering the thirteen shares, for which she gave a signed receipt.\\nAfter the issuance of this certificate for thirteen shares, the defendant thus held two certificates, one for fifty shares and the other for thirteen shares. Subsequently, a new certificate was issued by the bank to the defendant covering her entire stock ownership of sixty-three shares, for which she gave a signed receipt to the bank.\\nSubsequently, in October, 1929, defendant sold the thirteen shares which she last acquired in 1928, thus leaving her the owner of fifty shares. The bank thereupon issued to her a new certificate covering her fifty shares, for which she gave to the bank a signed receipt. This stock certificate for the fifty shares is in the possession of the defendant and represents the stock ownership on which the suit is based.\\nAt the opening of their brief, appellant\\u2019s attorneys accurately state the question presented by the appeal as follows:\\n\\u201cIn this case, wherein more than three but less than six years have expired from the date of a superadded liability assessment against an insolvent bank\\u2019s stockholder (the defendant), the question presented is whether the six year statute is applicable to a suit upon such liability.\\u201d\\nIn Bennett v. Thorne, 36 Wash. 253, 78 Pac. 936, 68 L. R. A. 113, the court stated that the six-year statute was applicable to such an action. That holding, however, as appellant frankly points out, was not necessary to the decision of the case. Before a similar question arose in this court, and, in fact, within less than three months after the announcement of the decision in Bennett v. Thorne, the supreme court of the United States handed down the decision in McClaine v. Rankin, 197 U. S. 154, 49 L. Ed. 702, 25 S. Ct. 410. This case arose out of the failure, in 1895, of the First National Bank of South Bend, Washington. The assessment upon which the action was based was made on August 17, 1896. Aldrich, the then receiver, later succeeded by Rankin, began the action in the circuit court of the United States for the western district of Washington on August 15, 1899, less than three, but more than two, years after it accrued. The court upheld defendant\\u2019s contention that the liability sued upon was not contractual, but a liability created by statute, and, therefore, subject to the two-year limitation imposed by Ballinger\\u2019s Code, \\u00a7 4805, now Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 165 [P. C. \\u00a7 8172]. Aldrich v. McClaine, 98 Fed. 378. On appeal, however, the circuit court of appeals held that the liability was contractual and governed by the limitation provided in subd. 3, \\u00a7 4800, Ballinger\\u2019s Code, now Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 159 [P. C. \\u00a7 8166]. The subdivision reads as follows:\\n\\u201cWithin three years: . . .\\n\\u201c3. An action upon a contract or liability, express or implied, which is not in writing, and does not arise out of any written instrument; ...\\u201d\\nWhen the matter reached the supreme court of the United States, it held that the liability was not contractual, but one created by statute, and, after discussing our limitation statutes and the cases construing them, held that the two-year statute was applicable.\\nThe question again came before this court in Bates v. Cooley, 187 Wash. 489, 60 P. (2d) 23. In that case, a receiver of an insolvent Iowa bank sued a resident of Washington, the action being brought within three years, but more than two years, after it accrued. Upon appeal, as we have determined by examining the briefs, the defendant-appellant contended that the limitation period was two years, relying strongly upon the decision of the supreme court of the United States in McClaine v. Rankin, and other decisions which have followed it. The plaintiff-respondent, while citing Bennett v. Thorne, did not contend that the six-year statute applied, but insisted upon the application of the three-year statute. We quote from the decision:\\n\\u201cAppellant\\u2019s second contention is that the action in this state was not commenced within the time prescribed by the statute of limitations. The answer to this contention depends upon the nature of a stockholder\\u2019s liability for an assessment upon his stock as directed by the statute. While the remedy is controlled by the law of the forum, the nature of the right for which the remedy is sought is controlled by the laws of the state wherein the right accrues.\\n\\u201cIt is the settled law of Iowa that the double liability of stockholders under constitutional and statutory provisions is contractual in its nature. [Citing five such cases.]\\n\\u201cThe liability being a contractual one, the applicable statute of limitations is Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 159 [P. C. \\u00a7 8166], which prescribes a three-year limitation. This action was brought within that period.\\u201d\\nThe appellant urges that the last of the three paragraphs above quoted is dictum, because, in order to arrive at the decision, it was only necessary for the court to hold that the two-year statute did not apply. It is at least fair to say that the contest between the parties in the case was wholly concerning whether the two or three-year statute applied, and that the possible applicability of the six-year statute was not urged upon the court. The decision cannot be rightly regarded as being contra to either Bennett v. Thorne or McClaine v. Rankin, because the result is made to turn on the nature of the right to be enforced, as indicated by the place of its origin. In Bennett v. Thorne, the right sought to be enforced was created by \\u00a7 11, Art. XII of the constitution of Washington. In Mc-Claine v. Rankin, the right sought to be enforced was created by a Federal statute. In Bates v. Cooley, the right was created by the law of Iowa. Obviously, these rights could well be different in nature.\\nThe case of Bates v. Cooley is clearly authoritative, in that it establishes a method of approach to the question presented, and requires us, as the first step in the inquiry, to examine the statutes and decisions of the state of Michigan, in which state the liability sought to be enforced in the instant case accrued, in order to determine its nature. It is stipulated that the liability was imposed by \\u00a7 48, Act. No. 66, Public Acts of Michigan, 1929. This section reads, in part:\\n\\u201cThe stockholders of every bank shall be individually liable, equally and ratably, and not one for another, to satisfy the obligations of said bank to the amount of their stock at the par value thereof, in addition to the said stock; ...\\u201d\\nThis, as is said by the supreme Court of Michigan in Fors v. Farrell, 271 Mich. 358, 260 N. W. 886, \\u201cdoes not differ materially from the corresponding portion of the National banking law,\\u201d and the reasoning of the supreme court of Michigan respecting the nature of the liability follows the Federal decisions. This is particularly apparent in the comparatively recent opinions of that court in Lawrence v. DeBoer, 273 Mich. 172, 262 N. W. 660, and the case of Fors v. Thoman, 267 Mich. 148, 255 N. W. 297. Both of these decisions are based upon Christopher v. Norvell, 201 U. S. 216, 50 L. Ed. 732, 26 S. Ct. 502, which states the Federal rule as follows:\\n\\u201cHer liability for the debts of the bank is created by the statute, although in a limited sense there is an element of contract in her having become a shareholder.\\u201d\\nIn Fors v. Thoman, the supreme court of Michigan said:\\n\\u201cThe liability of a stockholder in a bank is imposed by the statute. It was created for the protection of the creditors of the bank. Although in a limited sense there is an element of contract when one becomes a stockholder, the liability for an assessment is based on the provisions of the statute.\\u201d\\nSee, also, Simons v. Groesbeck, 268 Mich. 495, 256 N. W. 496, where it is said that the obligation is \\u201ccontractual in its nature.\\u201d\\nWe conclude, from an examination of the foregoing Michigan cases, and others not cited, that the nature of the superadded liability created by the Michigan statute is the same as that of the liability created by the national banking act. One of the latest and most authoritative statements as to the nature of that liability was made in Brown v. O\\u2019Keefe, 300 U. S. 598, 81 L. Ed. 827, 57 S. Ct. 543:\\n\\u201cTrue indeed it is that the liability is created by a-statute, and not solely by agreement. McClaine v. Rankin, 197 U. S. 154, 159, 161; Christopher v. Norvell, 201 U. S. 216, 225, 226. No disclaimer by the stockholder would be effective to avoid it. Even so, the liability, created though it is by statute, is quasi-contractual in its origin and basis.\\u201d (Italics ours.)\\n\\u201cQuasi\\u201d means \\u201cas if, almost\\u201d (Bouvier), and quasi-contracts are not contracts at all. They do not rest upon consent. They are obligations created by legal fiction in order to do justice: Restatement Law of Contracts, \\u00a7 5, Comment (a); Keener on Quasi-Contracts, chapter 1; Bouvier\\u2019s Law Dictionary \\u201cQuasi-Contracts\\u201d; and, although the Michigan decisions do not describe the liability as being \\u201cquasi-contractual,\\u201d they speak of it as contractual \\u201cin a limited sense,\\u201d and say there is \\u201can element of contract\\u201d in it and as being \\u201ccontractual in its nature.\\u201d But this is a far cry from holding that the liability arises out of a written agreement.\\nOur statute (Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 157 [P. C. \\u00a7 8162]) provides the following limitation:\\n\\u201cWithin six years: . . .\\n\\u201c2. An action upon a contract in writing, or liability express or implied arising out of a written agreement.\\nWe are inclined to the opinion that this statute does not contemplate quasi-contracts or liabilities merely contractual in nature, but liabilities which are either expressly stated in a written agreement or which follow by natural and reasonable implication from the promissory language of the agreement, as distinguished from liabilities created by fictional processes of the law or imported into the agreement from some external source. But if we are mistaken in this view, there are other considerations which lead to the same result.\\nIf the obligation arises out of a written contract, what and where is the contract? Those cases which hold that the obligation arises out of a written contract are not in agreement as to where the contract is to be found. For example, in Kingston v. Old Nat. Bank of Centralia, 359 Ill. 192, 194 N. E. 213, it is held that the contract is found in the charter:\\n\\u201cThe charter granted the bank under the provisions of the statute constituted a contract between the stockholders and the State. Every stockholder by the acquisition of stock in the bank assented to the contract and became bound by its terms to pay the superadded liability imposed by the statute which by operation of law was read into and became a part of the charter. (Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 4 L. ed. 629; Farrington v. Tennessee, 95 U. S. 679, 24 L. ed. 558.)\\u201d\\nOther courts have held that it is read into, and becomes a part of, the stock subscription contract. It will be noted in each instance that the liability is read into the alleged written contract and not implied from anything of a promissory nature appearing in the writing. Such a process is, of course, absolutely necessary in order to hold that the liability arises out of a written contract in a case where the defendant purchased his stock before the superadded liability statute was passed. In such a case, there can be no pretense that the stockholder promised and agreed.\\nThe appellant in this case acknowledges the difficulty, or rather the impossibility, of pointing out the written instrument on which he sues, but, with relation to that matter, says, in his brief:\\n\\u201cWe do not rest our case upon the proposition that any particular instrument represents the contract, but we do say that this obligation arises out of a written instrument of some sort rather than out of any oral understanding.\\u201d\\nAnd, in another place in the brief, he further says:\\n\\u201cWe do not believe it is even necessary in this case for the court to state which agreement is the basis of the liability; it is enough that the instrument which furnishes the basis for the liability is in writing whether it be the stock certificate, charter or otherwise.\\u201d\\nWe cannot agree. In our opinion, under the circumstances shown in this case, it was quite as necessary for the plaintiff to produce the contract as it would have been had the action been upon an agreement to pay the debt of another and the defendant had pleaded the statute of frauds.\\nIt is admitted that this suit was brought against Mrs. Garrett more than three years after the cause of action arose. She pleaded that it was not brought within the time limited by law. It is further admitted that that plea is good, unless the suit is upon a liability \\u201cexpress or implied arising out of a written agreement.\\u201d The courts of the state where the liability arose have said that it is \\u201ccontractual in its nature,\\u201d but, in so far as we are advised, and a thorough search has been made of the decisions, they have not said that it is a true contract, or that it arises out of a written agreement. Whether or not it arises out of a written agreement, we must, therefore, determine for ourselves.\\nIt is obvious that we cannot find that it is an express liability arising out of a written agreement, unless we can see or know the contents of the agreement. It is equally obvious that we cannot hold that the liability sued upon is an implied liability arising out of a written agreement, unless the agreement relied upon is produced so that we may determine whether its language warrants the implication. The action, therefore, must fail.\\nThe judgment appealed from is affirmed.\\nMain, Steinert, and Jeffers, JJ., concur.\", \"type\": \"majority\", \"author\": \"Robinson, J.\"}, {\"text\": \"Blake, C.

The street is paved with concrete, and is fifty-six feet in width from curb to curb, carrying double street car tracks in the center.\\nShortly after midnight on the morning of December 16, 1937, a semi-trailer truck, owned and operated by defendant Snohomish Auto Freight Co., Inc., a corporation, being driven by defendant Charles Schacht-schneider, its employee, was proceeding in a southerly direction, the driver intending to turn to his right and enter by private driveway the premises of Consolidated Dairy Products, on the westerly or right-hand side of Elliott avenue, about the middle of a block. It had been raining, and the pavement was damp. A street light was suspended over the center of the street, approximately in front of the Dairy Products plant, there being another street light something over three hundred feet to the north.\\nFollowing the truck and trailer along Elliott avenue was an automobile, owned and operated by plaintiff Arthur G. Trudeau, Mrs. Trudeau and their friend, George Kumpe, being passengers in the car. Almost immediately after the truck and trailer commenced to turn to the right, Mr. Trudeau\\u2019s car collided with the trailer, striking it on its left rear corner. The evidence indicates that the Trudeau car was traveling at from twenty to twenty-five miles per hour.\\nPlaintiffs Arthur G. and Helene Trudeau, husband and wife, sued defendants for damages by way of personal injuries and damage to their car, and George Kumpe also sued for damages as the result of personal injuries which he received. The actions were consolidated for trial and resulted in verdicts in favor of plaintiffs. Motions for judgments in defendants\\u2019 favor notwithstanding the verdicts, or in the alternative for new trials, upon all statutory grounds, were seasonably interposed. These motions having been denied, judgments were entered upon the verdicts, from which judgments defendants have appealed, the actions having been consolidated for hearing before this court.\\nAppellants assign error upon the giving of each of seven instructions. They also assign error upon the denial of their motions to dismiss the actions at the close of the respondents\\u2019 case; upon the denial of their motions for judgment in their favor notwithstanding the verdicts; and upon the denial of their motions for new trials. Finally, they assign error upon the entry of judgments in respondents\\u2019 favor.\\nAs appellants did not stand upon their motions to dismiss interposed at the close of respondents\\u2019 case, but introduced their evidence, they cannot now assign error upon the denial of these motions. Appellants may, however, assign error upon the denial of their motions for judgments in their favor notwithstanding the verdicts, and upon the ruling of the court denying their motions for new trials.\\nIn this connection, appellants argue that the evidence did not disclose any negligence on the part of appellants, and also that respondents Trudeau were guilty of contributory negligence, and that this court should so hold as matter of law.\\nRespondents, pursuant to the verdicts returned, were awarded judgment as follows: In favor of respondents Trudeau, $7,500 for personal injuries suffered by respondent Helene Trudeau, $1,000 for personal injuries suffered by respondent Arthur G. Trudeau, and $400 on account of damages to respondents\\u2019 automobile; in favor of respondent George Kumpe, $5,000 on account of personal injuries suffered by him.\\nAs to weather conditions at the time of the accident, the evidence is in conflict. The record contains testimony to the effect that a light rain was falling at the time of the accident, while, in the opinion of other witnesses, the rain had ceased prior to that time. There is, however, no question but that the pavement was wet. Some of the witnesses also testified to the fact that there was some mist in the air, and that the gathering of moisture on the windshield necessitated operation of a swiper.\\nAppellants contend that the trial court erred in refusing to grant their motions for judgment in their favor as matter of law, contending that the evidence was insufficient to carry to the jury any question of negligence on their part. They also argue that it should be held that respondent Arthur G. Trudeau, in operating his car, was negligent, and that the court should have held that respondents Trudeau cannot recover because of his contributory negligence.\\nRespondents contend that the evidence showed that the tail light on appellants\\u2019 truck was not shining. A witness who saw the accident testified that, after the accident, the tail light was out, and that appellant truck driver stated in the presence of the witness that it had not been shining. There is, however, much testimony in the record to the effect that the rear of the truck carried four running lights, showing red to the rear. There is some evidence to the effect that these lights were dimmed by dirt on the lenses. In view of our conclusion on some other questions, neither the condition nor number of these lights is of great importance.\\nRespondents contend that appellant driver gave no proper signal of his intention to turn to his right. It appears that the truck was equipped with a semaphore signal, but that, at the time of the accident, this signal was broken and could not be used. The driver testified positively that he did give the required arm signal, giving notice of his intention to turn to the right. The body of the truck was approximately a foot wider than the cab, which would somewhat lessen the visibility of an arm signal. Mr. Trudeau testified that he saw no signal whatsoever. Another witness, testifying on behalf of respondents, stated that, after the accident, appellant driver stated in the presence of the witness that he had given no signal of his intention to turn.\\nRespondents also contend that, from the evidence, the jury might have found that appellants\\u2019 truck first swung to its left, to or beyond the center of the street, and then turned sharply to its right, obstructing practically all of the west half of the highway. The driver of the truck testified that, as he prepared to turn, he slowed down to a speed of four or five miles per hour. Other testimony suggests that he may have been moving at a somewhat faster rate.\\nAs to the location of the exact point where the collision occurred, the evidence is in conflict. Some of the witnesses testified that respondents\\u2019 automobile and the trailer collided near the middle of the street, while other witnesses fixed the point of collision six or seven feet east of the west curb. From evidence in the record, the jury might have found that, without a signal, or with an arm signal which, because of the size and shape of the truck, could not be seen by the driver of a car following the truck in a position a little to the right of the left side of the truck, the latter was swung sharply first to the left and then to the right. The evidence as to the matter of the existence of lights on the rear of the truck, or the visibility thereof, if any, was also to some extent in conflict.\\nAppellants contend that, on the question of lights, it should be held, as matter of law, that red lights located upon the rear of the truck were shining, and that it should be held, as matter of law, that respondent Arthur G. Trudeau was guilty of contributory negligence, and that the action of respondents Trudeau should be dismissed. In this connection, appellants cite the cases of Reincke v. Tacoma R. & P. Co., 138 Wash. 304, 244 Pac. 577, and Graves v. Mickel, 176 Wash. 329, 29 P. (2d) 405. In the former case, it appeared that the plaintiff, on a rainy night, drove his car into the rear of a parked truck, which plaintiff, although he testified that his lights were working well, did not see until he was within ten feet of the point of collision. In the latter of the cases cited, the facts were somewhat similar, plaintiff, who drove into a stalled truck, having been held guilty of contributory negligence. In the two cases cited, the trucks into which the respective plaintiffs drove their cars were standing still, and the cases are not controlling here.\\nThe trial court did not err in denying appellants\\u2019 motions for judgment in their favor as matter of law.\\nAppellants excepted to several instructions given by the trial court, and assign error upon the giving of these instructions. Instruction No. 7 reads as follows:\\n\\u201cYou are instructed that if you find from the evidence herein that the driver of the defendants\\u2019 truck turned to the right to enter a private driveway from a main traveled highway, then he became the disfavored driver and must use such degree of care that an ordinarily careful and prudent driver would use under like or similar circumstances; any failure so to do is negligence.\\u201d\\nIt seems probable that, in using the term \\u201cdisfavored driver,\\u201d the trial court had in mind situations which arise at street intersections. By Rem. Rev. Stat., Vol. 7A, \\u00a7 6360-88 [P. C. \\u00a7 2696-846], it is provided that, on approaching a highway intersection, the operator of any vehicle shall give way to vehicles approaching on his right, arterial highways being excepted from the operation of the statute. Many cases have arisen in which consideration of the section cited was necessary, and the driver on the left has frequently been referred to as \\u201cdisfavored.\\u201d These cases fall generally into two classes: First, where two vehicles approaching a street intersection from different directions collide within the intersection; and second, cases involving two vehicles on the same highway, approaching an intersecting street from opposite directions, one of the vehicles turning to its left at the intersection. Our attention has not been called to any case in which the statute was considered in connection with an action between the drivers of two vehicles which had been proceeding in the same direction on the same street. The last portion of the instruction is correct, but the first portion thereof, in which the jury were told that, when appellant driver turned to his right \\u201che became the disfavored driver,\\u201d was incorrect and misleading.\\nAppellants also excepted to instruction No. 12, which reads as follows:\\n\\u201cYou are instructed that when the defendants attempted to turn their truck off the public highway into a private driveway, they were bound to exercise a degree of care commensurate with the circumstances, and were bound to know that other users of said highway were not required to anticipate that the defendants\\u2019 truck would be turned off the highway at a point other than at a regular intersection; the plaintiff driver had a right to assume that any such turn would be preceded by a signal and could rely on that assumption until, in the exercise of reasonable care, he knew or should have known otherwise.\\u201d\\nAppellants argue that, in so far as by this instruction the jury were told that appellant driver was bound to know that other users of the highway were not required to anticipate that the truck would turn off the highway at a point other than a regular intersection, the instruction lays down for the guidance of the jury an incorrect rule of law.\\nIn the case of Spencer v. Magrini, 115 Wash. 29, 195 Pac. 1041, it appeared that the plaintiff was driving north on G street, in the city of Tacoma, the defendant\\u2019s car following. The defendant testified that he was traveling at about eighteen miles per hour, maintaining a distance of about fifteen feet or less behind plaintiff\\u2019s car; that suddenly, when defendant\\u2019s car was within four or five feet of plaintiff\\u2019s, the latter car, to avoid a parked car, without warning turned sharply to the left, and in front of defendant\\u2019s car, resulting in a collision. On appeal, this court affirmed a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, saying in the course of the opinion:\\n\\u201cIt was clearly the duty of appellant [defendant] to avoid respondent\\u2019s car in front of him. The respondent\\u2019s car had the right of way over the car behind. Respondent was required to avoid the car parked at the side of the street and turned to the left in order to do so. If the appellant desired to pass the respondent\\u2019s car, it was his duty to give some warning and also to keep far enough to the left to avoid the respondent\\u2019s car. This he did not do. He was therefore negligent.\\u201d\\nIn the case of Bell v. Northwest Cities Gas Co., 164 Wash. 450, 2 P. (2d) 644, this court approved an instruction in the following language:\\n\\u201c \\u2018You are further instructed that it is the duty of the driver of an automobile, such as the defendant was in this case, to use due care to avoid colliding with vehicles in front of him, and if you should find from the evidence that the defendant did not use due care to avoid such collision, and that such failure was the proximate cause of the collision, then I instruct you that your verdict should be for the plaintiff.\\u2019 \\u201d\\nIn the case of Jacklin v. North Coast Transportation Co., 165 Wash. 236, 5 P. (2d) 325, error was assigned upon the giving of the following instruction:\\n\\u201c \\u2018You are instructed that it is the duty of one operating an automobile to do so in a careful and prudent manner, and when following behind another vehicle he should proceed at such a speed and at such a distance from the vehicle ahead as will permit him to avoid a collision in the event the automobile ahead may be required to come to a sudden stop, irrespective of whether or not the driver of the preceding vehicle gives any signal of his intention so to stop. He is bound to anticipate that the automobile or vehicle ahead might be required to stop by traffic regulations, and it is his duty to look out and be prepared for a stop on the part of the automobile ahead required by any traffic signal or regulation, and to keep at such a distance and to maintain such control of his automobile as to enable him to stop without hitting the vehicle ahead.\\u2019 \\u201d\\nIt was held that the instruction embodied a correct statement of the law.\\nWhile appellant truck driver, in turning to his right into the private driveway, was bound to exercise a degree of care commensurate with the situation, the trial court erred in instructing the jury that he was also\\n\\u201c.. . . bound to know that other users of said highway were not required to anticipate that defendants\\u2019 truck would be turned off the highway at a point other than at a regular intersection.\\u201d\\nMany dwellings and buildings used for business purposes maintain private driveways which are frequently used. It cannot be said, as matter of law, that the driver of an automobile following another car should not have in mind the possibility that the preceding car may turn from the street into a private driveway. The trial court correctly instructed the jury that respondent driver had the right to assume that any such turn would be preceded by a proper signal, but, as above indicated, the instruction was erroneous in the particular mentioned.\\nIn support of their contention that the instruction laid down the correct rule of law, respondents cite Jovaag v. O\\u2019Donnell, 189 Minn. 315, 249 N. W. 676; Balzer v. Caldwell, 220 Wis. 270, 263 N. W. 705; and Reichert v. Rex Accessories Co., 228 Wis. 425, 279 N. W. 645. In the first case cited, the supreme court of Minnesota considered a statute of that state (Mason\\u2019s Minn. St. 1927, \\u00a7 2720-17) which provided:\\n\\u201cThe driver of any vehicle upon a highway before starting, stopping or turning from a direct line shall first see that such movement can be made in safety,\\u201d etc.\\nThe opinion c\\u00e1lls attention to other negligent acts of the driver of the leading car.\\nIn the other two cases cited, the supreme court of Wisconsin had before it a statute of that state (\\u00a7 85.16 (2) Stats. 1935, Wisconsin Laws of 1929, chapter 454, p. 708) which provided:\\n\\u201cThe operator of a vehicle upon a roadway shall not deviate from the traffic lane in which he is operating without first ascertaining that such movement can be made with safety to other vehicles approaching from the rear.\\u201d\\nThe Wisconsin statute defines a traffic lane as\\n\\u201cThat portion of a roadway paralleling the center line of the roadway having a width of not less than seven feet and not more than ten feet, whether or not such portion is indicated by marks or markers.\\u201d (\\u00a7 85.10 (34), Stats. 1935, Wisconsin Laws of 1929, chapter 454, p. 705.)\\nRem. Rev. Stat., Vol. 7A, \\u00a7 6360-80 [P. C. \\u00a7 2696-838], reads in part as follows:\\n\\u201cWhenever a roadway has been divided into three or more clearly marked lanes for traffic, the following rules, in addition to all others consistent herewith, shall apply:\\n\\u201c(a) Every vehicle shall be operated as nearly as practical entirely within a single lane and shall not be moved from such lane until the operator thereof has first ascertained that such movement can be made with safety; . . .\\u201d\\nAs it nowhere appears that Elliott avenue west was divided into three or more lanes for traffic, the section of our code last quoted does not apply, and the cases decided by the supreme court of Wisconsin are not in point. The cases also differ on the facts from the case at bar. The authorities relied upon by respondents are not in point.\\nRespondents also contend that, because the court properly instructed the jury as to the duty of the operator of an automobile, when following another vehicle, to exercise care, keep his car under reasonable control, and be alert to existing conditions, the instructions above held erroneous were not prejudicial. We are of the opinion that the rule which respondents contend should be applied is not here applicable, and that it cannot be held that the erroneous instructions, in view of others given, were not prejudicial.\\nAppellants excepted to instruction No. 27, which concerned any verdict the jury might return in favor of respondent George Kumpe. By this instruction, the jury were told that they should take into consideration any loss of earnings which respondent Kumpe had suffered, or probably would suffer in the future, as a result of the injuries he received in the collision, and that respondent Kumpe would also be entitled to recover the reasonable cost of necessary medical and hospital treatment,, together with an allowance for future medical care and attention. Respondent Kumpe is an officer of the United States army, and we find in the record no evidence that, as a result of the accident, he lost any earnings whatsoever. The instruction, then, submitted to the jury, as an element of damage, a matter concerning which there was no evidence in the record. It should also be noted that, in his complaint, respondent Kumpe did not allege that he had suffered any loss of earnings, or that his earning capacity had been impaired by his injuries.\\nIt may also be doubted that the record contains any evidence as to the reasonable value of respondent Kumpe\\u2019s expenditures for medical service and hospital bills. Expenditure or liability for these items, together with the reasonableness of the amounts, must be proved as any other alleged item of damage.\\nThe instruction complained of was erroneous in the two particulars noted. Van Liew v. Atwood, 115 Wash. 580, 197 Pac. 921; Ely v. North Coast Lines, 151 Wash. 137, 275 Pac. 78; Cole v. Schaub, 164 Wash. 162, 2 P. (2d) 669, 7 P. (2d) 1119; Hutteball v. Montgomery, 187 Wash. 516, 60 P. (2d) 679.\\nIn view of the fact that the judgment appealed from must be reversed and a new trial ordered, other errors relied upon by appellants need not be discussed.\\nFor error in instructing the jury, the judgment appealed from is reversed, with directions to the trial court to grant a new trial.\\nSteinert, Geraghty, and Jeffers, JJ., concur.\", \"type\": \"majority\", \"author\": \"Beals, J.\"}, {\"text\": \"Blake, C.

Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company et al., Defendants, Henry A. Scandrett et al., Appellants.\"], \"opinions\": [{\"text\": \"Jeffers, J.\\nThis action was instituted by Opal Morris, as the personal representative of the estate of Wade Morris, deceased, for the benefit of herself and three minor daughters, to recover damages against the defendants, Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company, a corporation, Henry A. Scandrett, Walter Cummings, and George I. Haight, trustees in bankruptcy thereof, Frank Warren, and Charles T. Holley, for the death of Wade Morris, husband of plaintiff and father of the three minor children, which occurred at a highway grade crossing west of Ellens-burg, in a collision between a truck operated by deceased and the regular passenger train of the defendant corporation, operated at the time by defendants Frank Warren and Charles T. Holley.\\nThe complaint, in so far as material herein, alleged that, while the truck of deceased was lawfully on the railroad and highway crossing, one of defendant corporation\\u2019s trains, traveling in a westerly direction, and being operated and controlled by the defendants Frank Warren and Charles T. Holley, without sounding any whistle, bell, or warning of any nature whatsoever, and traveling at a dangerous, excessive, and unlawful rate of speed of sixty miles per hour, or more, crashed into the truck and caused the death of Wade Morris. The complaint further alleged that the highway and crossing are clearly visible to anyone operating a train along the railroad in a westerly direction for more than a mile east of the crossing.\\nThe answer denied the allegations of negligence in the complaint and affirmatively alleged that the contributory negligence of deceased was the sole proximate cause of the collision and death of deceased. The reply denied the affirmative matter alleged in the answer.\\nThe action was tried to the court and jury, and resulted in a verdict in favor of plaintiff, wherein damages were awarded to the widow in the sum of ten thousand dollars, and to the daughters of deceased and plaintiff as follows: Dorothy Morris, three thousand dollars, Danell Morris, five thousand dollars, and Marion Morris, seven thousand dollars.\\nA challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence was interposed at the end of plaintiff\\u2019s case, which was denied. Motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and in the alternative for new trial, were timely made and denied, and this appeal by defendants followed.\\nBy stipulation of counsel, the defendant Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company, a corporation, was dismissed from the action, and this appeal is being prosecuted by the other defendants.\\nThe accident occurred about four miles west of El-lensburg, at approximately four-thirty A. M., on the morning of July 28, 1938, at a point where the highway to the coast over Snoqualmie pass crosses the main line of the railroad. The highway referred to is what is known as the old road, and was being used, and had been used since about April 1st, for the reason that the new highway was being paved.\\nThe physical facts relative to the crossing, the highway upon which deceased was proceeding at the time of the accident, and the conditions generally existing at the scene of the collision, are, we think, undisputed. The highway runs nearly parallel with the railroad track for some considerable distance east of the crossing. There were no trees, brush, or any other obstructions, except telephone poles along the north side of the highway and the trolley poles on the south side of the tracks, for a distance of about sixteen hundred feet. The testimony shows that, at about sixteen hundred feet east of the crossing, it is 442 feet between the highway and the tracks, and that from the center of the highway to the nearest rail at the point where the highway makes the turn to the right to cross the tracks, is forty-five feet. The testimony conclusively shows that it was daylight. There was a railroad crossing sign over two hundred feet east of the crossing on th\\u00e9 highway, and a large warning sign at the crossing.\\nDeceased had been over this road the day before; going after hay, and at the time of the accident, was returning toward his home in Renton. Deceased was driving a Mack truck, and had the hay loaded thereon so that it was about eight feet wide, and came up higher than the top of his cab, his view to the rear being entirely obstructed by his load. The cab had side windows, the dimensions of which were about sixteen by eighteen inches.\\nFollowing the truck driven by deceased was another truck driven by Lyle Hall, who was accompanied by his thirteen year old daughter, and some distance behind the Hall truck was another truck, also traveling west, driven by Earl Clark, accompanied by Sidney King. There was no traffic immediately approaching from the west.\\nDeceased had driven onto the highway ahead of the Hall truck, from a cross-road leading into it from the new highway, at a point about three-quarters of a mile east of the crossing, and thereafter had proceeded ahead of the Hall truck to the crossing. Lyle Hall, called as a witness for appellants, stated that his speed from the time deceased pulled in ahead of him to the crossing was about twenty-six to twenty-seven miles per hour; that deceased was about three hundred feet ahead of him and remained about that distance in front of him until deceased turned to cross the tracks. The witness further testified that he saw deceased\\u2019s truck at all times after it came on the road in front of him until it was struck. Hall further testified that, as deceased came onto the turn, he slowed down to about ten to twelve miles per hour, and was moving at that speed when struck by the train. Hall further testified that, at the time of the collision, he was two hundred to two hundred fifty feet behind deceased, and that deceased did not stop prior to crossing the tracks. He further testified that the train was about one hundred fifty to two hundred feet from the crossing when deceased started to make the turn, and that he thought the train was going forty to forty-five miles per hour. He also testified he heard no whistle.\\nEarl Clark, who was driving the truck following the Hall truck, called as a witness for respondent, testified that he was about a quarter of a mile from the crossing at the time of the collision. The witness stated that he was driving at about forty to forty-five miles per hour, and that the train was going sixty to sixty-five miles per hour; that he could see the truck which was struck, although there was another truck loaded with hay between him and deceased\\u2019s truck; that it was daylight, and he was not using lights to drive by; that there were no buildings, trees, or cuts to keep one from seeing the train, and that it was perfectly level. This witness and others testified that it would be impossible, because of the load, for deceased to see back in the direction the train was coming, until he went into the turn to approach the crossing, and the testimony varies as to how far one could then see, unless he stopped and leaned out of the car window. The witness heard no whistle.\\nSidney King, a witness for respondent, testified he was a truck driver, and lived at Yakima. He was riding with Clark, and he testified that, when they were about three-tenths of a mile from the crossing, he saw two trucks ahead of them, and that one of them stopped and the other one just started to pull onto the tracks, when there was a big flash of fire; that he saw the train when it was about a quarter of a mile from the crossing; that the train was going sixty to sixty-five miles per hour, and that the Clark truck, in which he was riding, was going forty to forty-five miles per hour; that the truck which was struck was down close to the curve when he first saw it, and was going quite slow, probably five miles an hour. He further testified that he just presumed deceased\\u2019s truck was going at that speed; that he could see a quarter of a mile ahead and tell how fast the truck was going. The witness did not know whether deceased\\u2019s truck stopped before crossing or not.\\nMr. Westerfield, an employee of the Railway Express Agency, and in no way connected with appellants except that he worked on the train, testified that he was looking out the window on the left side and saw the two trucks loaded with hay; that he saw them shortly before the first truck passed from his view as it went into the turn to approach the crossing; that the other truck (Hall truck) was about a city block behind; that the trucks were going considerably slower than the train, and that the truck which was hit slowed down as it went into the turn.\\nThe witnesses, Hall, King, Clark, and Westerfield were the only eye-witnesses to the operation of deceased\\u2019s truck and to the conditions surrounding the scene of the accident just prior thereto, and, in our opinion, they are all disinterested witnesses.\\nAppellants contend the court erred in refusing to hold, as matter of law, that deceased was guilty of contributory negligence which was the proximate cause of his death.\\nThe decision we have reached on this question, in our opinion, is controlling in this case and renders it unnecessary to pass upon the question of whether or not appellants were negligent, although we have herein called attention to one case which we think expresses the general rule in this state relative to the claimed negligence of appellants.\\nIn the consideration of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the evidence most favorable to respondent must be accepted as true.\\nThe doctrine of contributory negligence is based upon the principle' that no person is ever absolved from exercising reasonable and ordinary care for his own safety. Von, Saxe v. Barnett, 125 Wash. 639, 217 Pac. 62; Garrow v. Seattle Taxicab Co., 135 Wash. 630, 238 Pac. 623, 45 A. L. R. 293; Alexiou v. Nockas, 171 Wash. 369, 17 P. (2d) 911. We stated in North Coast Power Co. v. Cowlitz C. & C. R., 108 Wash. 591, 185 Pac. 615:\\n\\u201cIt is, according to both reason and authority, the rule that what would be due care under certain circumstances would not be due care under other or different circumstances, and that, if anything in the surrounding conditions and circumstances reasonably suggests the necessity for an increase of care to avoid peril and damage, the duty to increase such care proportionately increases. This court, in Helliesen v. Seattle Elec. Co., 56 Wash. 278, 105 Pac. 458, tersely said: \\u2018In determining the question of contributory negligence due care or ordinary prudence is the only known test.\\u2019 \\u201d\\nAs to the right of the court to determine that a person is guilty of contributory negligence, as a matter of law, we stated, in the early case of McQuillan v. Seattle, 10 Wash. 464, 38 Pac. 1119, 45 Am. St. 799:\\n\\u201cThere are two classes of cases in which the question of negligence may be determined by the court as a conclusion of law. . . . The first is where the circumstances of the case are such that the standard of duty is fixed, and the measure of duty defined, by law, and is the same under all circumstances. . . . And the second is where the facts are undisputed and but one reasonable inference can be drawn from them. . . . If different results might be honestly reached by different minds then negligence is not a question of law, but one of fact for the jury.\\u201d\\nThe rule announced in the McQuillan case has been followed in Traver v. Spokane Street R. Co., 25 Wash. 225, 65 Pac. 284; Bell v. Northwest Cities Gas Co., 164 Wash. 450, 2 P. (2d) 644; Harry v. Beatty, 177 Wash. 153, 31 P. (2d) 97; Scott v. Pacific Power & Light Co., 178 Wash. 647, 35 P. (2d) 749; Hayden v. Colville Valley Nat. Bank, 180 Wash. 220, 39 P. (2d) 376; Jackman v. Seattle, 187 Wash. 446, 60 P. (2d) 78; Nystuen v. Spokane County, 194 Wash. 312, 77 P. (2d) 1002; Bender v. White, 199 Wash. 510, 92 P. (2d) 268.\\nOne who approaches a railway crossing on a public highway is as much under the duty of keeping a lookout as is the railway company; and with knowledge that the railway company has the right of way, and cannot instantly stop its trains to avoid accidents, it becomes his duty to use every means which a reasonably prudent person would use, under the existing circumstances, to avoid a collision.\\nIn the case of Mouso v. Bellingham & N. R. Co., 106 Wash. 299, 179 Pac. 848, we announced the following rule, which has since been consistently followed:\\n\\u201cIn a case like this, where the physical facts are uncontroverted and speak with a force that overcomes all testimony to the contrary, reasonable minds must follow the physical facts, and therefore cannot differ.\\u201d\\nIn the instant case, we think the physical facts are not controverted, and that the testimony of the three disinterested eye-witnesses is not in conflict as to any essential and controlling fact. It is true there was a difference of opinion as to the speed of the train, but this, in our opinion, would not be an essential and controlling fact, as all of these witnesses stated that the truck was plainly visible for a quarter of a mile as it went into the turn to approach the crossing, and it also appears that there was no obstruction of any kind shutting off the view down the tracks to the east, other than the obstruction caused by the hay on the driver\\u2019s truck, and that there was no reason why deceased could not have seen the train after making the turn, even with his load, had he looked. It is apparent the train must have been close at the time deceased made the turn to approach the tracks, as he had only thirty-five or forty feet to go, and his truck was struck about the middle of the cab.\\nIn Benedict v. Hines, 110 Wash. 338, 188 Pac. 512, the deceased husband and father had been killed in a highway crossing accident. It appears that he had continued his speed of ten to fifteen miles per hour up until the collision. The highway paralleled the tracks for some distance on the west side going to the crossing. There was a conflict in the evidence as to whether or not a whistle was blown. In the cited case, we quoted from Bowden v. Walla Walla Valley R. Co., 79 Wash. 184, 140 Pac. 549:\\n\\u201c \\u2018The driver of an automobile, approaching such a crossing as the one in this case, must make reasonable use of his senses to guard his own safety, and the failure to do so is negligence;\\u2019 \\u201d\\ncontinuing:\\n\\u201cThere is no dispute as to the essential and controlling facts. Together with the physical facts disclosed by the oral evidence, photographs, and maps of the scene, they stand as a unit to convince one of the charge of contributory negligence, as a matter of law.\\u201d\\nIt is contended by respondent that appellants were negligent in operating the train at an excessive speed, and in failing to blow a whistle or give any warning. We held in Sadler v. Northern Pac. R. Co., 118 Wash. 121, 203 Pac. 10, that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence, as a matter of law, in that he failed to exercise the degree of care imposed upon him, and that the suing widow could not recover, irrespective of the negligence of the defendants.\\nRespondent contends that, because the hay on the truck was a lawful load, even though it obstructed all view to the rear, deceased was not negligent in not seeing the train, apparently contending that deceased was entitled to take advantage of a condition which he had himself created. Respondent admits that where the evidence shows an unobstructed view of an approaching train at a time when it would have been possible to stop, and there is no reason for not seeing the train, one who proceeds onto the track is guilty of contributory negligence, but contends such a situation is not present in the instant case, because it is claimed the proof shows the deceased was in a position where he could not see the train. This contention is based entirely upon the fact that, if deceased\\u2019s view was obstructed, it was because of the load of hay on the truck. It seems to us, the obstruction having been caused by deceased, he, realizing such to be the case, must be held to a higher degree of care in approaching a railroad crossing, in order to determine whether or not he could safely cross, because of the condition for which he himself was responsible, than would otherwise be required.\\nIn McFadden v. Northern Pac. R. Co., 157 Wash. 437, 289 Pac. 1, the deceased was killed when he collided with a train which was crossing a street. The accident occurred at night, and it was foggy at the time. In the cited case, the court quoted from the case of Keene v. Pacific Northwest Traction Co., 153 Wash. 310, 279 Pac. 756, as follows:\\n\\u201c \\u2018There was, it is true, a fog, at the time, which more or less obscured his [the injured person\\u2019s] vision, but this, instead of excusing him from exercising care and caution, rather added to his duty in that respect. If he could not see whether or not he was entering a zone of danger in venturing onto the railway track, it was his duty to take some other means of ascertaining the fact. He could not abandon all caution, take a chance on escaping injury, and, failing to escape, charge his delinquency to another.\\u2019 \\u201d\\nSee Dumbolton v. Oregon-Washington R. & N. Co., 186 Wash. 433, 58 P. (2d) 806.\\nThe above cited cases bear out the general rule that, where any condition is present which tends to obscure the view of one approaching a railroad crossing, a greater degree of care, proportionate to the conditions prevailing, is required of such one in determining and observing the danger of approaching trains.\\nWe think the case of DeTemple v. Schafer Bros. Logging Co., 169 Wash. 102, 13 P. (2d) 446, is also in point, and that, under the rule therein announced, deceased in the instant case did not use that degree of care required of him under the conditions existing at the time of the accident, and that therefore the trial court should have held, as a matter of law, the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence, barring a recovery herein.\\nIn Haaga v. Saginaw Logging Co., 169 Wash. 547, 14 P. (2d) 55, after a second rehearing En Banc, we stated the rule relative to one approaching a railroad crossing, as follows:\\n\\u201cWe have repeatedly stated that the general rule regarding the standard of care to be exercised by those traveling upon a highway is that they must exercise a reasonable care under the existing circumstances. We have, in many of our decisions, given judicial expression to what is commonly and currently accepted as a well-known fact, i. e., that a railroad crossing is a proclamation of danger, and that those who propose to enter its zone must govern themselves accordingly.\\n\\u201cRecognizing this principle, we have added to the usual rule of \\u2018reasonable care under the circumstances,\\u2019 the specific requirement that the traveler approaching a railroad crossing must look and listen. Accompanying this statement of the rule is the added requirement that the observation must be made at a point or from a position where it would be effective.\\u201d\\nSpokane County v. Great Northern R. Co., 178 Wash. 389, 35 P. (2d) 1, we think also sustains appellants\\u2019 contention herein, both on the facts and the rule therein applied.\\nThere are many decisions by this court dealing in some measure with highway crossing accidents. We think no good purpose would be served by a further discussion of such cases, believing, as we do, that the cases referred to herein express the rules adopted and followed by this court under a state of facts such as shown in the instant case.\\nWe conclude, therefore, that the court erred in not holding, as a matter of law, that deceased was guilty of contributory negligence, barring a recovery herein, and that because of such error, this case must be reversed, unless the evidence herein was properly submitted to the jury along with the presumption of due care arising because of the death of Wade Morris.\\nWas it proper in this case to submit to the jury an instruction on presumption of due care, three disinterested witnesses having testified to deceased\\u2019s actions in the operation of his truck for at least a quarter of a mile before and up to the scene of the accident?\\nThe first case we desire to refer to is Norman v. Bellingham, 46 Wash. 205, 89 Pac. 559, wherein we stated:\\n\\u201cIn this state the burden is upon the party affirming it to establish contributory negligence, and where the evidence is silent as to the question, due care is presumed.\\u201d\\nIn the case of Woolf v. Washington R. & N. Co., 37 Wash. 491, 79 Pac. 997, plaintiff contended the presumption of due care should be applied. It was held the presumption was not applicable, because of the testimony of two witnesses, the court therein stating:\\n\\u201cWere there no proof in the case bearing upon this matter, it would probably be proper to indulge this presumption. . . . Such a presumption is not to be invoked where there is competent, material evidence upon the question involved.\\u201d\\nIn Scarpelli v. Washington Water Power Co., 63 Wash. 18, 114 Pac. 870, the court, in discussing the effect and character of presumptions, quoted from Peters v. Lohr, 24 S. D. 605, 124 N. W. 853:\\n\\u201c \\u2018A presumption is not evidence of anything, and only relates to a rule of law as to which party shall first go forward and produce evidence sustaining a matter in issue. A presumption will serve as and in the place of evidence in favor of one party or the other until prima facie evidence has been adduced by the opposite party; hut the presumption should never he placed in the scale to he weighed as evidence. The presumption, when the opposite party has produced prima facie evidence, has spent its force and served its purpose, and the party then, in whose favor the presumption operated, must meet his opponents\\u2019 prima facie evidence with evidence and not presumptions. A presumption is not evidence of a fact, but purely a conclusion.\\u2019 \\u201d (Italics ours.)\\nIn the cited case, the verdict was for plaintiff. Defendant\\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict was granted, and this judgment we affirmed,\\nBeeman v. Puget Sound Traction etc. Co., 79 Wash. 137, 139 Pac. 1087, quotes with approval from Paul v. United Rys. Co., 152 Mo. App. 577, 134 S. W. 3, as follows:\\n\\u201c \\u2018 \\u201cPresumptions\\u201d as happily stated by a scholarly counselor ore tenus, in another case, \\u201cmay be looked on as the bats of the law, flitting in the twilight but disappearing in the sunshine of actual facts.\\u201d That presumptions have no place in the presence of actual facts disclosed to the jury, or where plaintiff should have known the facts had he exercised ordinary care, is held in many cases ... To give place to presumptions on the facts of this case, is but to play with shadows and reject substance.\\u2019 \\u201d\\nIn Smith v. Inland Empire R. Co., 114 Wash. 441, 195 Pac. 236, the following rule is announced:\\n\\u201cSince no one saw the deceased at the time he approached the crossing, and since there was no evidence to show what he did at or before he attempted to cross the railway track, it must be presumed that he used due care.\\u201d\\nIn the cases of Jensen v. Culbert, 134 Wash. 599, 236 Pac. 101; Romano v. Short Line Stage Co., 142 Wash. 419, 253 Pac. 657; Mattingley v. Oregon-Washington R. & N. Co., 153 Wash. 514, 280 Pac. 46, the rule that if no witness saw the accident, due care must be presumed, was announced and followed, with this addition, that in the Mattingley case, where the only witnesses were interested witnesses, we still held the rule was applicable.\\nIn Eaton v. Hewitt, 171 Wash. 260, 17 P. (2d) 906, and Smith v. Seattle, 172 Wash. 66, 19 P. (2d) 652, we again stated that the presumption of due care was applicable, there being no evidence as to what the one killed did or did not do.\\nIn Reinhart v. Oregon-Washington R. & N. Co., 174 Wash. 320, 24 P. (2d) 615, the rule is also announced that, where there is no evidence to the contrary, there is a presumption that one killed in an accident was, at the time, in the exercise of due care. It is also stated in the cited case that this presumption is not evidence, but will serve as such until prima facie evidence has been introduced by the opposite party; that the presumption of due care may be overcome by the direct testimony of disinterested witnesses, but it is not overcome by the testimony of interested witnesses, or from inferences that may be drawn from circumstantial facts.\\nCarlson v. Seattle, 175 Wash. 388, 27 P. (2d) 717, was tried to the court without a jury. We held, there being competent and credible testimony as to what the deceased did before and up to the time of the collision, it was not a case where due care must be presumed.\\nSpokane County v. Great Northern R. Co., 178 Wash. 389, 35 P. (2d) 1, we think much in point on the facts. In the cited case, a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence was sustained at the close of plaintiff\\u2019s case. We therein stated:\\n\\u201cThe authority relied upon by appellant and others to like effect are not controlling here, because in this case several witnesses testified that they saw Mr. Sharkey approach the track and observed him up to the moment of the accident. Under the evidence in the case at bar, there is no room for the application of the rule as to the presumption of due care. This case rather falls within the rule laid down in Woolf v. Washington R. & Nav. Co., 37 Wash. 491, 79 Pac. 997, and Carlson v. Seattle, 175 Wash. 388, 27 P. (2d) 717.\\nWe now come to the case of Karp v. Herder, 181 Wash. 583, 44 P. (2d) 808. In the cited case, there were two disinterested witnesses who testified relative to the action of Mrs. Karp, who was killed in the accident, but nevertheless we held it was proper to submit to the jury an instruction on the presumption of due care, saying:\\n\\u201cWhether this story [referring to the testimony of one of the witnesses] was true, partially true, or false, was for the jury, and not the court, to say. If taken at its face value, it, of course, was sufficient to overcome the presumption of due care on the part of Mrs. Karp. If not so accepted, it was not sufficient. The court properly left the question for the determination of the jury.\\u201d\\nIn Trainor v. Interstate Const. Co., 187 Wash. 142, 60 P. (2d) 7, the question presented was whether or not Mr. Hoyt, who died as a result of the accident, was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. We held that deceased was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law, and that the presumption of due care must give way to the definite testimony of Mrs. Hoyt, who testified to exactly what Mr. Hoyt did prior and up to the time of the accident. In the cited case, the court attempted to distinguish the Karp case, as follows:\\n\\u201cIt would thus appear that whether the presumption was overcome as a matter of law or is a question of fact for the jury, must depend upon the facts of the particular case.\\u201d\\nIn Hamblet v. Soderburg, 189 Wash. 449, 65 P. (2d) 1267, the trial court sustained a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence at the close of plaintiff\\u2019s case, and dismissed the action. The judgment was affirmed. In the cited case, there were a number of eye-witnesses to deceased\\u2019s actions from the time she started to enter the intersection until she was struck, and we again announced the rule as follows:\\n\\u201cThere being testimony as to every movement of the deceased, there is no room for a presumption that she used due care. The facts are clear and undisputed, presenting no question upon which reasonable minds might differ and therefore no question to go to the jury.\\u201d\\nWe think the rule is based primarily upon the fact that there is no evidence to show what the deceased did or did not do immediately preceding the accident; and so, where an action is brought for damages resulting from such death, in order that the action may go forward, in the first instance, to that stage of the proceedings where it can be presented to a court or jury, the law indulges in a conclusion which presumably is based upon human experience, that the deceased must be presumed to have used due care.\\nThis presumption, however, being purely a conclusion, and not evidence of anything, it must follow, it seems to us, that, when disinterested witnesses testify as to such actions of the deceased, even though such testimony may be in conflict or be disputed, the presumption must disappear. In other words, where there is such testimony, there is no longer any reason for the rule, and to say that, regardless of such testimony, the jury has a right to also consider the presumption, would, in our opinion, be permitting the presumption to be placed in the scale, to be weighed as evidence.\\nWe appreciate that the decision in the Karp case, supra, may seem to find some support in one or two of our decisions rendered prior thereto; nevertheless, after a careful consideration of all our cases touching this question, we are convinced that the rule announced in the Karp case, to the effect that, even where there is testimony of disinterested witnesses, still the presumption may go to the jury, together with such testimony, it being for the jury to determine whether or not the presumption has been overcome, is contrary to the rule announced by this court and, almost without exception, followed prior to such decision, and is, we think, contrary to the rule announced in the Tramor and Soderburg cases, supra, decided subsequent thereto.\\nWe are therefore now of the opinion that the following are the proper rules to be applied relative to the presumption of due care:\\n(1) This presumption is not evidence, but will serve in the place of evidence until prima facie evidence has been introduced by the opposite party.\\n(2) This presumption entirely disappears from the case upon the introduction of competent and material testimony of disinterested witnesses, as to the actions of the deceased immediately prior to and continuing up to the time of the accident; and where such testimony is introduced, the presumption should in no event be submitted to the jury. However, even though there be the testimony of disinterested witnesses, such testimony and all the other competent and material evidence must be submitted to the jury, unless the court can say that the essential and controlling facts necessary to establish the contributory negligence of deceased are undisputed, and that the only reasonable inference which can be drawn therefrom is that deceased failed to exercise that degree of care required of him, under the conditions existing at the time and place of the accident.\\n(3) Where the only testimony introduced in opposition to the presumption is that of interested witnesses, or where there is no testimony as to the actions of the deceased immediately prior to and at the time of the accident, the presumption must go to the jury, together with all the testimony and exhibits properly introduced in the case, unless from all the evidence the court can say that the contributory negligence of the person killed was so evident that reasonable minds could not differ thereon.\\nThere being, in the instant case, testimony of disinterested witnesses as to the acts of deceased immediately prior to and up to the time of the accident, there is no room for the presumption that deceased used due care.\\nWe think the facts are clear and undisputed, presenting no question upon which reasonable minds might differ; and, therefore, there was no question to go to the jury, and the trial court should therefore have so determined as a matter of law and granted appellants\\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\\nFor the reasons herein assigned, the judgment is reversed, with instructions to dismiss the action.\\nBeals and Geraghty, JJ., concur.\", \"type\": \"majority\", \"author\": \"Jeffers, J.\"}, {\"text\": \"Steinert, J.\\n(concurring)\\u2014I am in full accord with all that is said in the opinion except that part, near the conclusion, designated as rule (3). As I view it, the purpose and effect of a presumption are, in any event, merely to require the opposite party to come forward with evidence upon the particular issue involved, but the presumption itself is not evidence and should not be weighed as such against actual facts. When the opposite party has been required to assume the burden of coming forward with evidence, the presumption has then not only accomplished its purpose but has also, at the same time, completely spent its force. No part of the presumption being left, it neither possesses nor retains anything of substance in itself to be submitted to the jury.\\nIf the testimony offered by the opposite party be that of interested witnesses, the case, as then made, should go to the jury, but without any reference to the presumption, and the jury should then decide the issues solely upon the evidence before it. To cast the presumption into the scale as an added element is to give it weight as evidence, and to instruct the jury with reference to the presumption is affirmatively to invite the jury to consider it as evidence.

George Irving Pattee, Appellant.\"], \"opinions\": [{\"text\": \"Beals, J.\\nPlaintiffs, Harry M. and Leah Hefner, husband and wife, sued defendant, George Irving Pattee, seeking judgment for damages on account of injuries suffered by Mrs. Hefner as the result of an intersection collision between plaintiffs\\u2019 automobile and one driven by defendant. Plaintiffs also asked for damages on account of injuries to their car. Defendant having answered, denying negligence on his part, and pleading contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff Harry M. Hefner, who was driving plaintiffs\\u2019 car, and cross-complaining for damages to his own automobile, the action was tried to a jury, which returned a verdict in plaintiffs\\u2019 favor in the sum of fifteen hundred dollars. Defendant\\u2019s motions for judgment in his favor notwithstanding the verdict, or in the alternative for a new trial, having been denied, judgment was entered upon the verdict, from which defendant has appealed.\\nAppellant assigns error upon the denial of his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence; upon the denial of his motions for directed verdict and for judgment in his favor notwithstanding the verdict, or in the alternative a new trial; and upon the entry of judgment in plaintiffs\\u2019 favor. Error is also assigned upon the court\\u2019s ruling permitting the jury to view respondents\\u2019 car; upon the rejection of two exhibits offered by appellant; upon the giving of two instructions; and upon the refusal to give one instruction requested.by appellant.\\nThe collision occurred at about seven o\\u2019clock in the evening, June 26, 1938. Respondents were driving in their Chevrolet (Mr. Hefner at the wheel) west along east One Hundred Fifth street, a graveled roadway, and were approaching the intersection with Thirty-fifth avenue northeast, which is an arterial highway running north and south, the center portion being paved to the width of twenty-one feet. Approaching the intersection from the east, One Hundred Fifth street rises at a four per cent grade, while approaching the intersection from the north, Thirty-fifth avenue rises at an eight per cent grade. There is a stop sign on One Hundred Fifth street east of the intersection. A row of telephone poles stands on the shoulder on each side of the paved portion of Thirty-fifth avenue. The country is rather rough, high grass bordering and encroaching on the highways. The record contains two photographs of the intersection, one taken on One Hundred Fifth street to the east of the arterial and the other looking south along Thirty-fifth avenue from a point to the north of the intersection. The situation was evidently one which required careful observation on the part of a driver attempting to cross the arterial highway.\\nMrs. Hefner testified that she had no recollection whatever of the collision, as the result of which she suffered serious injuries. Mr. Hefner testified that, as he approached the intersection with Thirty-fifth avenue, he brought his car to a stop at a point ten or twelve feet east of the paved portion of Thirty-fifth avenue. He stated that his view to his left was somewhat obstructed by shrubbery, but that he had a clear view to his right down Thirty-fifth avenue. He testified that he looked to his right, between the second and third poles, his view covering a distance of about three hundred feet; and that, seeing no traffic approaching from the north, respondent\\u2019s right, along Thirty-fifth avenue, from which direction along the highway appellant\\u2019s car was actually approaching the intersection, respondent looked to his left, and seeing no approaching traffic, put his car into low gear and started to cross the paved portion of the arterial, continuing to look toward his left. When the rear of his car had reached approximately the center line of the arterial, respondent again looked to his right and saw appellant\\u2019s car approaching at a high rate of speed, which respondent estimated at sixty miles an hour. He testified that he continued on, but that, after his car had proceeded no further than approximately three feet, it was struck on the right rear wheel by appellant\\u2019s car. The impact threw both respondents from the car, inflicting upon Mrs. Hefner serious injuries.\\nThere was no eye-witness to the accident. One witness testified that he was driving along Thirty-fifth avenue some distance behind appellant\\u2019s car, but this witness did not see the collision, and his testimony as to the speed of appellant\\u2019s car is rather vague and indefinite, though indicating that the car was not proceeding at anything like sixty miles an hour.\\nRem. Rev. Stat., Vol. 7A, \\u00a7 6360-90 [P. C. \\u00a7 2696-848], reads as follows:\\n\\u201cThe operator of any vehicle shall stop as required by law at the entrance to any intersection with any arterial public highway, and having stopped shall look out for and give right of way to any vehicles upon such arterial highway simultaneously approaching a given point within the intersection, whether or not such vehicle first reach and enter the intersection.\\u201d\\nAn intersection area is defined by Rem. Rev. Stat., Vol. 7A, \\u00a7 6360-1 [P. C. \\u00a7 2696-767] (u), as follows:\\n\\u201c (u) \\u2018Intersection Area.\\u2019 The area embraced within the prolongation of the lateral curb lines, or, if there be no curbs, then the lateral roadway boundary lines, of two or more public highways which join one another at an angle, whether or not such highways cross one another.\\u201d\\nNeither of the streets above referred to is curbed, and the boundary lines of the streets, taking into consideration their full width of sixty feet, are not clearly defined.\\nRem. Rev. Stat., Vol. 7A, \\u00a7 6360-1 [P. C. \\u00a7 2696-767] (ww), defines roadway as follows:\\n\\u201c (ww) \\u2018Roadway.\\u2019 The paved, improved or proper driving portion of a public highway designed or ordinarily used for vehicular travel.\\u201d\\nAccording to a map of the intersection and vicinity, drawn to scale, which was introduced in evidence, the stop sign stands a little less than thirty feet east of the east line of the pavement on Thirty-fifth avenue.\\nMr. Hefner, who is herein referred to as respondent, testified that he stopped his car at a point ten or twelve feet east of the pavement line. He drew on the map the position of his car at the point he testified he stopped, which indicates that, in his position at the wheel, he was about seventeen feet east of the pavement line. He testified that he looked to the right, and that the road was clear, \\u201cprobably down to between the second and third pole;\\u201d that a large bush obstructed his view to the left; that, when he started to cross the road, he looked to his left; and that, when his car was a little more than halfway across, he again looked to his right, when he saw appellant\\u2019s car approaching at a terrific rate of speed, the impact occurring almost instantly.\\nOn further examination by his counsel, respondent stated, in answer to a question as to how long it took his car to go from the position where it stopped to the point where the accident happened: \\u201cWell, I would say around seven seconds; about that length of time.\\u201d\\nOn cross-examination, the following occurred:\\n\\u201cQ. Then how far north on 35th were you able to see from the position where you came to a stop before entering the highway? A. I looked down to between the second and third pole and there was no car coming in that range. Q. Was there anything to prevent you from seeing farther down the street if you had looked? A. I think a person could have seen farther. My wife was sitting on that side, but that seemed to be a perfectly safe position to cross there. Q. Would it have been possible to see farther than the third telephone pole? A. Yes, it would have been possible. Q. You could see down there probably half a mile? A. Yes, I think so. Q. At any rate when you in that position looked to the right, nothing intervening to obscure your vision, you didn\\u2019t see any automobile approaching, did you? A. That is right. Q. Then you proceeded ahead and you started to cross the arterial highway? A. I looked to the left, and there was nothing coming from the left, and I started on across. Q. You looked to your left while you were still stopped? A. Well, there was\\u2014may I explain this?\\n\\u201cThe Court: Yes.\\n\\u201cQ. Well, I think my question can be answered by yes or no. A. There was a bush on the left-hand side and you could not see as well to the left, and I was looking to the left as I started up so that I could get a better view. Q. So you kept your vision to the left as you started up there and as you entered the highway? A. Yes. I looked up there far enough to see, and then I looked straight ahead. Q. And as I understand you your rear wheels had reached the center line of the street and your front wheels were three feet off of the concrete before you again looked to your right.\\n\\u201cMr. Williams: No, he didn\\u2019t testify to that.\\n\\u201cA. No, I didn\\u2019t say that. Q. (By Mr. Rosling) Well, if I am incorrect in my recollection of your testimony just correct me. A. Well, the rear wheels\\u2014when I first saw Mr. Pattee the back end of my car was not quite across the yellow line. Q. The yellow line is down the center? A. That is right. Q. Then how far \\u2014let me see. That would be to the east of the yellow line. Then how far were your rear wheels when you first saw Mr. Pattee? A. Well, they were possibly a foot or two\\u2014maybe a foot. Q. They had not quite reached the yellow line then? A. I would say that that is correct. Q. And you hadn\\u2019t looked to your right from the time that you stopped until that instant when your rear wheels were a foot or two short of the center of the street, isn\\u2019t that right? A. I looked to the right when I stopped\\u2014after I had stopped. That is correct. I hadn\\u2019t looked again until then. Q. You didn\\u2019t look again until your rear wheels were almost up to the yellow line? A. That is right. Q. Then you did look to the right? A. Then I glanced back to the right again. Q. At that instant the front of your car had already left the concrete? A. No. I said that it had left the concrete when his car struck mine. Q. Well, how long is your car? Have you measured it? A. It is about 14 feet, or a little over. Q. That is right, 14 feet. A. Yes, sir. Q. That is from bumper to bumper? A. Yes, sir. Q. Did your car have bumpers on it? A. Yes, sir. Q. It was a \\u201931 Chev coupe, wasn\\u2019t it? A. That is right. Q. And having arrived at that position you looked to the right and then saw Mr. Pattee for the first time? A. That is right. Q. And he was then, as you estimate it, approximately three car lengths away? A. That is right. Q. And do I restate your testimony properly when I say that from the time that you first saw him until the instant of impact you had only moved three feet? A. I would estimate that that is about right. Q. Yes. A. Three or four feet. Q. Well, then, the rear end or the bumper of your car was probably over the center line? A. It was about, I would say\\u2014yes\\u2014just about over the center line. Q. So the entire half of the south bound traffic lane of 35th avenue was blocked by your car, wasn\\u2019t it, at the instant of impact? A. Which half? Not the south half. Q. The west half\\u2014that is for south bound traffic. A. Yes, sir, that is right. Q. And at that instant your front wheels were off of the concrete? A. Yes, sir.\\u201d\\nLater, respondent testified:\\n\\u201cThe Court: When you looked to the right you said that you look down two or three poles. How far would that be?\\n\\u201cThe Witness: Well, I would say between the second and third pole\\u2014down to there would be 300 feet\\u2014 around 300 feet or more. Q. (By Mr. Williams) Are the poles marked up there on the map? A. The distance of those poles was 142 feet apart, and the first pole was about 122 feet from the point of impact.\\n\\u201cMr. Williams: Could we mark in the distance between these poles?\\n\\u201cMr. Rosling: The map is drawn to scale, one inch equalling ten feet, and the poles are drawn on the map. I have no objection to your measuring it.\\n\\u201cThe Court: Where is the second pole?\\n\\u201cThe Witness: Here is the second pole (indicating).\\n\\u201cMr. Rosling: I believe that that is the third pole, isn\\u2019t it?\\n\\u201cThe Witness: Not the third pole from this side. The first pole was about here and the second one here (indicating on map).\\n\\u201cThe Court: What is the scale of the map?\\n\\u201cMr. Rosling: I was looking at the other street. One inch equals ten feet.\\n\\u201cThe Court: Well, just measure from there up to the pole and see how far it is.\\n\\u201cThe Witness: It is 14-% inches. That would figure about 142 feet.\\n\\u201cThe Court: Between poles?\\n\\u201cThe Witness: Between poles. This first pole here was on this side (indicating), and the measurement from about the center of this place here (indicating) is 122 feet to this first pole.\\n\\u201cThe Court: What I mean is, how far did you look down 35th avenue?\\n\\u201cThe Witness: I looked down to somewhere between this second pole and the third.\\n\\u201cThe Court: And you estimate approximately 300 feet?\\n\\u201cThe Witness: Yes, sir.\\n\\u201cThe Court: And you didn\\u2019t see any car?\\n\\u201cThe Witness: No, I didn\\u2019t. Not in that distance.\\u201d\\nAccording to the plat, the telephone poles stand seven or eight feet east of the edge of the pavement. From the position in which he testified he was when he stopped his car, respondent\\u2019s view of the highway between the second and third telephone poles must have been/ as disclosed by the map, extremely limited, and yet the fact that he observed the arterial between these two poles impressed itself upon his mind. In any event, he testified positively that he looked down the arterial approximately three hundred feet, and that he did not again look to his right for a period of approximately seven seconds, and until he had crossed the east half of Thirty-fifth avenue and was blocking the entire west half of the pavement and directly in the path of a car approaching from his right.\\nSection 6360-90, supra, placed upon respondent the burden of looking out for and giving the right of way to any vehicle upon the arterial highway simultaneously with respondent approaching the intersection. There were no curb lines indicated upon the arterial, the area embraced within the highway outside of the paved portion being, according to the photograph in evidence, not clearly defined. Under the other two sections above quoted, the intersection area was very much less than sixty feet in width, in so far as the arterial highway was concerned, although the highway was, in fact, sixty feet wide.\\nIn the case of Hamilton v. Cadwell, 195 Wash. 683, 81 P. (2d) 815, we held that traffic approaching an arterial highway is required to stop immediately before entering upon the highway, at a point where the disfavored driver can see traffic approaching from either direction on the arterial highway.\\nIn the leading case of Rosenstrom v. North Bend Stage Line, 154 Wash. 57, 280 Pac. 932, we called attention to the mandatory duty resting upon the disfavored driver to yield the right of way to approaching traffic on the arterial, and that, after the disfavored driver reached the margin of the street,\\n\\u201c . . . there were no intervening objects between him and the stage, and if he failed to see it, it is evident that he did not look with that degree of care the law requires. The statute cited was enacted in the interests of the public good. Its purpose is to facilitate traffic on the public highways and prevent accidents thereon. It is the duty of every user of the highway to give it heed, and it would seem that under no circumstance would its disregard be justifiable.\\u201d\\nThe facts in the Rosenstrom case differ from those in the case at bar, but the language quoted from the opinion is here pertinent.\\nIn the case of McAllister v. Anderson, 169 Wash. 14, 13 P. (2d) 36, in affirming a judgment of the superior court, entered in a collision case after granting a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, this court used the following language:\\n\\u201cIt seems to us that the minds of reasonable men can not differ as to the contributory negligence of the appellants. When one driving on a non-arterial street or highway approaches an arterial highway, he knows and is bound to know that travelers thereon having or assuming to have the right of way will be traveling at considerable speed and keeping less than the usual outlook for intercepting cross-traffic.\\u201d\\nIn the recent case of Delsman v. Bertotti, 200 Wash. 380, 93 P. (2d) 371, we affirmed a judgment of the superior court dismissing an action for damages resulting from an intersection collision, calling attention to the fact that the disfavored driver undertook to cross an intersecting street without looking to his right from the curb line, from which point he would have had a clear view of approaching traffic, and would necessarily have seen the approaching vehicle, which had the right of way. Neither street was an arterial, but, in view of the facts, that is not an important difference. In the course of the opinion, we used the following language:\\n\\u201cIn the case at bar, appellant relied upon a somewhat restricted view of Fifteenth avenue to his right. A perfectly clear and unobstructed view was available to him after his car advanced only a few feet from where he took the observation upon which he relied. In failing to again look to his right, he was negligent. He did not bear the burden which rested upon him as the disfavored driver, and the trial court properly so held.\\u201d\\nIt must be borne in mind that respondent testified that, when he stopped his car, he looked to the north along Thirty-fifth avenue approximately three hundred feet, while there was a clear view along that highway for half a mile. If, from the point where respondent made this observation, he could see only three hundred feet along the arterial, whether because of obstructions, or because of the eight per cent down grade of Thirty-fifth avenue, or because of the angle from which he was looking, then he was negligent in not looking again to his right when he reached a point where his view was unrestricted. On the other hand, if, from the point where he made the observation, he could see half a mile along Thirty-fifth avenue, then he should have seen appellant\\u2019s car approaching, and taken steps to avoid it. He testified positively that he did not see appellant\\u2019s car until it was approximately three car lengths away.\\nThe burden rests heavily upon the disfavored driver to look out for and give way to traffic which enjoys, as to him, the right of way. Appellant\\u2019s automobile was there to be seen. The disfavored driver cannot escape the obligation which rests upon him, by saying that he did not see an approaching vehicle, if such vehicle was on the highway and plainly visible. Silverstein v. Adams, 134 Wash. 430, 235 Pac. 784; Strouse v. Smith, 166 Wash. 643, 8 P. (2d) 411; Hoenig v. Kohl, 182 Wash. 245, 46 P. (2d) 728.\\nThere can be no question but that, from any portion of the level part of Thirty-fifth avenue, one could see to the north along that street at least half a mile. While we do not hold that respondent was bound to stop at the edge of the pavement, he was bound to look to his right as well as to his left before undertaking to cross the pavement, and he was obligated to look from a position where he could observe approaching traffic.\\nIn the case of Fairchild v. Dean, 198 Wash. 1, 86 P. (2d) 271, this court, citing Benson v. Anderson, 129 Wash. 19, 223 Pac. 1063, used the following language:\\n\\u201cThe statutory enactments regulating traffic upon the public highways are made for the purpose of being obeyed. They are the outgrowth of necessity, and on the observance of them depends the safety of the users of the highways. Failure to obey the regulations not only endangers the safety of the person guilty of disobedience, but also endangers the safety of others using the highways in a lawful manner. Courts do not look lightly upon infractions of these regulations.\\u201d\\nRespondent cites many opinions of this court in support of the judgment. In several of these cases, the rule laid down in Martin v. Hadenfeldt, 157 Wash, 563, 289 Pac. 533, was properly applied, but that rule is not here applicable, as respondent testified that he did not see appellant\\u2019s car until an instant before the collision.\\nNo two collision cases are exactly alike. No fixed rule can be laid down as to questions of primary negligence or contributory negligence, but certain general principles have been definitely established.\\nAfter examination of all the authorities cited by both parties, we are convinced that it must be held that respondent was guilty of contributory negligence as matter of law, and that the trial court erred in not sustaining appellant\\u2019s motion for judgment in his favor notwithstanding the verdict.\\nIn reaching this conclusion, we are not unmindful of the principle which is stated in the case of Ver-cruysse v. Cascade Laundry Co., 193 Wash. 184, 74 P. (2d) 920, as follows:\\n\\u201cPlaintiffs having received a verdict, we must, in passing upon the question before us, not only regard all competent evidence in the record which is favorable to the plaintiffs as true, but must also give them the benefit of every favorable inference which may reasonably be drawn from such evidence. If, when so considered, the record reveals sufficient competent evidence to support the verdict, the judgment must be affirmed.\\u201d\\nGiving full force to this rule, we are nevertheless convinced that it must be held, as matter of law, that respondent was guilty of contributory negligence.\\nThe judgment appealed from is reversed, with instructions to the trial court to dismiss the action.\\nSteinert, Geraghty, and Jeffers, JJ., concur.\", \"type\": \"majority\", \"author\": \"Beals, J.\"}, {\"text\": \"Blake, C.

It permitted the taxes on the property for the years 1926, 1927, 1928, and 1929 to become delinquent.\\nOn August 8, 1936, a certificate of delinquency, covering approximately one thousand separate pieces of property the taxes on which had been delinquent for more than five years, including the two tracts owned by Cinebar Coal & Coke Company, was issued to the county. The county instituted proceedings to foreclose the tax liens upon the property included in the certificate. Notice and summons were served upon the defendants by publication in the official newspaper of the county in the manner prescribed by statute. No appearance in the cause was made by Cinebar Coal & Coke Company.\\nOn October 21, 1936, a judgment of foreclosure and order of sale was signed by the court and attested by the clerk. The judgment and order of sale was in book form, with duplicate pages inserted which, when detached, constituted an exact copy of the judgment and order of sale. The copy of the judgment and order of sale was also signed by the court and attested by the clerk. The judgment and order of sale directed the county treasurer to sell the property therein described according to law. The copy of the judgment and order of sale, so signed by the court and attested by the clerk, was delivered to the treasurer. The treasurer advertised the property for sale by posting notices in the manner prescribed by statute.\\nAt the sale, which was held on November 6, 1936, George A. Robinson became the purchaser of one of the tracts above mentioned, section 18, township 13 north, range 3 east of Willamette meridian, except lots five and six (5 and 6) and the southeast quarter (SE^) of the southeast quarter (SE%) of the section. Rose Galvin became the purchaser of the other section, less twenty-five acres of the northwest quarter (NW%). Deeds to the respective tracts were issued to the purchasers and filed for record with the county auditor. Thereafter, George A. Robinson sold the timber on the tract purchased by him to Tacoma Eastern Timber Company, and that company sold or assigned its title to the timber to Fairhurst Company.\\nOn August 10, 1937, Cinebar Coal & Coke Company instituted suit against George A. Robinson, alleging that it was the owner of the land purchased by Robinson and seeking a decree quieting its title. It also instituted a suit against Rose Galvin, which was in all respects similar to the suit against Robinson, except that the property involved was the tract of land purchased by Mrs. Galvin at the foreclosure sale. The defendants in each suit filed an answer, claiming ownership of the property under and by virtue of the deeds issued to them by the treasurer of Lewis county. Plaintiff filed a reply, alleging certain irregularities in the tax foreclosure proceedings\\\" which will be hereinafter noticed. The two cases were consolidated for trial. After a trial before the court, a decree was entered in each case dismissing the complaint of the plaintiff and quieting the title claimed by defendants. The plaintiff perfected an appeal in each case, but the two appeals were consolidated for hearing in this court.\\nAppellant contends that the judgment in the tax foreclosure proceeding was not on file with the clerk until after the date of the foreclosure sale, and, therefore, no valid judgment was in existence at the time the sale was held. Evidence was introduced by appellant which tended to prove that certain entries in the appearance docket, including the entry of the filing of the judgment, were not made until after the date of the sale, and that a file mark made with a rubber stamp on the cover of a book containing the judgment and order of sale had been altered by some one, who erased the date of filing stamped with the rubber stamp, and inserted with a pen the date, October 21, 1936. The trial court, as appears in its long and carefully prepared memorandum decision, was of the opinion that the evidence showed that the entries in the appearance docket were made after the date of the sale, probably in December, 1936, but found, and we find also, that the judgment of foreclosure and order of sale was signed by the court and attested by the clerk on October 21, 1936, and delivered to the clerk for filing on that date.\\nThe fact, if it be a fact, that the entries in the appearance docket were not made until after the date of the sale, would not affect the validity of the judgment and order of sale or invalidate the sale had thereunder. A judgment is operative from the date of its entry, and it is entered when it is signed by the court and delivered to the clerk for filing. The failure of the clerk to perform the ministerial act of entering the filing of the judgment on the appearance docket or spreading the judgment upon the journal would not affect the validity of the judgment or invalidate the sale had thereunder. As is said in Freeman on Judgments at page 76:\\n\\u201cIn most jurisdictions the failure of the clerk to enter a judgment rendered by the court does not deprive it of its effect between the parties to it. It is therefore not indispensable to the validity of an execution and a sale made thereunder that the judgment should have been actually entered before the writ issued; and even though entry be regarded as essential, it may be made nunc pro tunc.\\u201d\\nOur previous decisions are in accord with the general rule. We quote from Quareles v. Seattle, 26 Wash. 226, 66 Pac. 389:\\n\\u201cWhen the judgment was signed by the court it was rendered, and, when it was filed by the clerk, became effective as a judgment. An execution might then have issued upon it. The fact that the clerk did not actually spread it upon the journal on that day, but waited seven days thereafter, did not delay the operation of the judgment for any purpose. The duty of copying the order was a ministerial duty, and imperative upon him. Under the statutes, supra, while the legislature may have recognized the distinction between the rendition of a judgment and its entry, yet the latter was required to be done upon the same day as the former, so that for all practical purposes, if the law is complied with, the rendition and entry of the judgment are simultaneous in point of time; that is to say, they are both to be done on the same day. It is often impracticable, on account of accumulation of business, for the clerk to comply with this law at the time designated, and, since the actual entry of the judgment on the journal is but a mere ministerial duty, the judgment is not thereby avoided. To hold that a judgment is not entered when it is filed and that the clerk may keep it for a number of days thereafter, awaiting his convenience or pleasure in transcribing it upon the journal, would be to hold that it is within the power of the clerk to delay indefinitely the time in which an appeal may be taken, and to leave the actual entry uncertain, and resting in the memory of the clerk or his deputy who transcribes it, or, if the date it is actually written on the journal is the date of the entry, then the requirement that it shall be entered on the day it is given is rendered of no effect. Certainty will be maintained and confusion avoided by holding, as we do, that under the statute the judgment is entered at the time a copy thereof is filed with the clerk.\\u201d\\nSee, also, Barthrop v. Tucker, 29 Wash. 666, 70 Pac. 120; Beetchenow v. Bartholet, 162 Wash. 119, 298 Pac. 335; 15 R. C. L., Judgments, 571, \\u00a7 5; 34 C. J., Judgments, 52, \\u00a7 182; Black on Judgments (2d ed.), 149, \\u00a7 106.\\nAppellant further contends that the sale was void for lack of authority in the county treasurer to make it. In Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 11281 [P. C. \\u00a7 6882-120], it is provided that the court shall give judgment for such taxes, interest, and costs as shall be due upon the several lots or tracts involved:\\n\\u201c. . . and the court shall order and direct the clerk to make and enter an order for the sale of such real property against which judgment is made, or vacate and set aside the certificate of delinquency or make such other order or judgment as in the law or equity may be just. Said order shall he signed hy the judge of the superior court and attested hy the cleric thereof, and a certified copy of said order, together with the list of the property therein ordered sold, shpXl he delivered to the county treasurer, and shall he full and sufficient authority for him to proceed to sell said property or so much of each tract or lot as may be necessary for said sum as set forth in said order and to take such further steps in the matter as are provided by law. . . .\\u201d (Italics ours.)\\nThe clerk delivered to the county treasurer a purported copy of the entire judgment. On each page is stamped:\\n\\u201cSuperior court\\nLewis County, Wash.\\nRec\\u2019d & Filed\\nOct. 21, \\u201936\\nMaurice MacDonald, Clerk\\nBy.....................................................................................................\\nDeputy.\\u201d\\nAcross the face of the stamp, as it appears on each page, is the word \\u201cCopy,\\u201d admittedly written by the clerk. It is contended that this is not a sufficient certificate and the treasurer had no jurisdiction to proceed with the sale. The statute, it will be noted, provides that a certified copy of the order of sale, together with a list of the property therein ordered sold, shall be delivered to the county treasurer, and that this \\u201cshall be full and sufficient authority for him to proceed to sell said property.\\u201d At the foot of each and every page of the purported copy of the judgment containing the lists of the property, the following appears:\\n\\u201cNow Therefore, in the name of the State of Washington: You, Harold Quick, County Treasurer in and for said County, or your successor in office, are hereby ordered and directed to sell according to law, the premises hereinbefore mentioned, together with the appurtenances thereunto belonging, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the judgment herein, together with accruing interest and cost.\\nC. A. Studebaker, Judge\\nAttest: Maurice MacDonald,\\nCounty Clerk and Clerk of the Superior Couft.\\nBy-.............................................................................................................................\\nDeputy.\\u201d\\nIt is admitted, or at least it is undisputed, that on each page the signatures of the judge and the clerk are their original signatures.\\nIt appears from the evidence that the treasurer occasionally had the original judgment in his office after it was entered and prior to the sale, and that the clerk delivered to him a duplicate original of the order of sale at the time he attested it. The duplicate original came into existence in the following manner:\\nThe judgment was prepared in the treasurer\\u2019s office and under his supervision. It was bound up in a book with duplicate pages. The treasurer delivered the book to the clerk, who presented it to the trial judge. The judge signed it, including the order of sale at the bottom of each and every page, and returned it to the clerk for attestation of the order of sale and for filing. The clerk called the treasurer and told him that the judge had signed and that he was attesting his signature to the order of sale. The treasurer went to the clerk\\u2019s office. When the clerk had finished attesting the judge\\u2019s signature, he had before him complete duplicate originals of the judgment and the order of sale. In the presence of the treasurer, the clerk affixed his file mark to each page. The treasurer then assisted him in tearing out every other page. These were assembled, and the clerk wrote \\u201cCopy\\u201d across the file mark on each of these pages and gave them to the treasurer; and so, instead of a formally certified copy of the order of sale, the treasurer was furnished with a duplicate original order of sale, signed by the judge and attested by the clerk.\\nIn view of the fact that the statute does not specify how the copy shall be certified, and in view of the further fact that the purpose of requiring certification is to insure that the treasurer shall receive a true and correct copy of the order of sale, we think that the furnishing of a duplicate original was a sufficient compliance with the statute, particularly since the statute involved is a tax-collection statute.\\nIn considering these cases, it must be remembered that we are not only dealing with tax-collection statutes, but also that the actions are collateral attacks upon a judgment in a tax foreclosure in which approximately a thousand pieces of property are involved and sales made to hundreds of other purchasers. Under such circumstances, when the proceedings are attacked collaterally, departures from the regulatory statutory provisions are regarded as fatal only when the complaining party is thereby denied some substantial right which would have been his had the statutory regulation been pursued strictly according to its terms (Miller v. Henderson, 50 Wash. 200, 96 Pac. 1052), or lack of jurisdiction is affirmatively shown. When the attack is collateral, all presumptions are in favor of the regularity of the proceedings (Timmerman v. McCul-lagh, 55 Wash. 204, 104 Pac. 212); and, as we have said in the much later case of Colby v. Himes, 171 Wash. 83, 17 P. (2d) 606:\\n\\u201cSection 127, chapter 130, Laws 1925, Ex. Ses., p. 314 (Rem. 1927 Sup., \\u00a7 11097-127), supra, clearly indicates the legislative intention to make tax deeds good as against technical or immaterial procedural defects not going to the merits. Such has long been both the legislative and judicial policy in this state.\\u201d\\nThat section is now Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 11288 [P. C. \\u00a7 6882-127], and reads as follows:\\n\\u201cDeeds executed by the county treasurer, as aforesaid, shall be prima facie evidence in all controversies and suits in relation to the right of the purchaser, his heirs and assigns, to the real property thereby conveyed of the following facts: First, that the real property conveyed was subject to taxation at the time the same was assessed, and had been listed and assessed in the time and manner required by law; second, that the taxes were not paid at any time before the issuance of deed; third, that the real property conveyed had not been redeemed from the sale at the date of the deed; fourth, that the real property was sold for taxes, interest and costs, as stated in the deed; fifth, that the grantee in the deed was the purchaser, or assignee of the purchaser; sixth, that the sale was conducted in the manner required by law. And any judgment for the deed to real property sold for delinquent taxes rendered after the passage of this act, except as otherwise provided in this section, shall estop all parties from raising any objections thereto, or to a tax title based thereon, which existed at or before the rendition of such judgment, and could have been presented as a defense to the application for such judgment in the court wherein the same was rendered, and as to all such questions the judgment itself shall be conclusive evidence of its regularity and validity in all collateral proceedings, except in cases where the tax has been paid, or the real property was not liable to the tax.\\u201d (Italics ours.)\\nIn our opinion, the treasurer is shown to have had jurisdiction to make the sale, and none of the irregularities shown is of such a character as can be held to have deprived the appellant of any substantial right. We, therefore, agree with the trial court that the tax foreclosure and sale must be held valid.\\nThere remains the charge of collusive bidding. We have read all of the evidence relating to this matter and agree with the trial judge that the testimony of one of the witnesses in support of the charge is extremely vague and indefinite, and that the testimony of the witness who did testify definitely regarding the matter is, for the reasons set out in the memorandum decision, unworthy of credit. The evidence in support of the charge is, in our opinion, outweighed by that of the two bidders, George A. Robinson and Rose Galvin, even though they were interested parties.\\nThe judgments appealed from are affirmed.\\nBlake, C.

The Superior Court for King County, Howard M. Findley, Judge, et al., Respondents.\"], \"opinions\": [{\"text\": \"Geraghty, J.\\nThis is an original application for a writ of mandate requiring the superior court of King county to take evidence for the purpose of determining and allowing certain offsets against the judgment affirmed by this court in State ex rel. Cooper v. Seattle, 199 Wash. 568, 92 P. (2d) 249.\\nThe facts material to the issue, as they appear in the application for the writ and in the return of the respondents to the show cause order, may be summarized as follows:\\nFour employees in the light department of the city of Seattle, having civil service standing, instituted an action against the city and certain of its officials, seeking a writ of mandate requiring that they be reinstated in positions they formerly held in the city\\u2019s service and for payment to them of the salaries attached to such positions during the period of their separation from employment.\\nFor convenience, the parties in that action, as well as in the present one, will be referred to as \\u201cemployees\\u201d and \\u201ccity.\\u201d\\nAt the trial of the first action, findings of fact and conclusions of law favorable to the employees were made by the court, and a judgment was entered directing the issue of a peremptory writ of mandate requiring the city to restore the employees to their former employment and to pay them the salaries attached to their positions, from October 21, 1937, to the date of their reinstatement, this date to be determined by the return of the city to the peremptory writ; the return was required to be made within ten days after entry of the judgment. The judgment also provided for crediting the city with specific amounts which the court found the employees had severally earned in private employment between the date of their suspension and the time of trial.\\nOn the city\\u2019s appeal, as we have seen, the judgment was affirmed in State ex rel. Cooper v. Seattle, supra. After the filing of the remittitur in the superior court, the city made application to the court to set a day for taking evidence\\n\\u201c. . . with respect to the amount of back pay relators [employees] are entitled to accruing since August 3, 1938, the date of the judgment herein, from which an appeal was taken and judgment affirmed, the remittitur having been filed August 9, 1939.\\u201d\\nThe motion is supported by the affidavit of Mr. Newton, assistant corporation counsel, reciting that\\n\\u201cAffiant is informed, and believes, that each of the relators [employees] herein since the date of said judgment . . . has earned various amounts in private and in City employment which are proper offsets against back pay and which in accordance with the affirmance of the judgment of the lower court should be determined in order that a final judgment may be entered herein; . . . \\u201d\\nThe employees, appearing specially, filed a motion to quash the application, challenging the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the motion or to conduct the' proceedings thereby contemplated, as being beyond the power of the court and not sanctioned by law. The court made an order granting the employees\\u2019 motion to quash, and denied the city\\u2019s application.\\nIn support of its application for the present writ, the city relies upon the language of the remittitur, which, after unconditionally affirming the judgment of the trial court, continues: \\u201cAnd it is further ordered that this cause be remitted to the said superior court for further proceedings in accordance herewith.\\u201d The city\\u2019s contention is that the quoted language in the remittitur contemplates further proceedings by the superior court.\\nWe see no merit in this contention. A reference to the opinion of this court discloses that no further proceedings in the superior court were required or necessary. The language of the remittitur upon which the city relies is part of the printed form used in all cases. If an opinion requires further proceedings or a modification of the judgment, the language of the remit-titur is, of course, appropriate; if the opinion embodies no direction or modification, but is an unqualified af-firmance, the quoted language of the remittitur has no force, because no further proceedings are required by the opinion.\\nWe have uniformly held that a judgment of the superior court appealed to this court and determined upon its merits, becomes, in effect, a judgment of this court, and the trial court is without power, after its remand, to vacate or otherwise modify it on motion or petition, except in such manner as may be necessary to carry out the court\\u2019s mandate. In re Shilshole Avenue, 101 Wash. 136, 172 Pac. 338, and the cases there cited.\\nThe trial court, therefore, properly dismissed the city\\u2019s application, because it had no jurisdiction to reopen the case for taking further evidence for the purpose of modifying a judgment affirmed by this court.\\nHowever, it is said in the Shilshole case that the rule announced above is so far modified that this court will,\\n\\u201c. . . upon a proper showing made within the year, grant leave to apply to the lower court for the vacation of a judgment affirmed by this court, for all or any of the causes set forth in \\u00a7 303 of the code or for any or all of the causes set forth in the chapter of the code included within \\u00a7\\u00a7 464-473.\\u201d\\nBut the city, in the present proceeding, is not applying for an order authorizing the superior court to reopen the case. It is relying, rather, upon what it incorrectly conceives to be a mandatory direction in the remittitur for further proceedings. Even if we were to treat the present application as one for an order authorizing the reopening of the case for taking further evidence by the superior court, with the view to a modification of the judgment, under Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7\\u00a7 303 [P. C. \\u00a7 8336] or 464 [P. C. \\u00a7 8130] et seq., the city has not made a showing sufficient to entitle it to such an order, because the relief it seeks does not fall within any of the specifications of these sections. Apart from this, it failed to make timely application, either to the court below before judgment or to this court before return of the remittitur, for relief in respect to the matter of the present application.\\nThe judgment contained a formula for fixing definitely the amount of back salary accruing to the employees after entry of the judgment, that is to say, for payment up to the date of their reinstatement, to be shown by the city\\u2019s return to the peremptory writ. No request was made by the city for inclusion in the judgment of a provision looking to the ascertainment of any offsets in its favor accruing after judgment.\\nOur opinion was filed July 15, 1939, and, under the statute and rules of court, the remittitur would not be sent.down for thirty days thereafter. Within this time, the city could have made application for inclusion in the remittitur of a specific direction to the superior court in reference to offsetting any earnings by the employees subsequent to entry of the judgment. Neither such application nor a petition for rehearing was filed, but, on the contrary, before the thirty-day period had elapsed, the city joined in a stipulation to have the remittitur sent down immediately. The public interest requires that an end shall be put to litigation, and that cases shall not be tried piecemeal.\\nThe writ must be denied.\\nBlake, C.

Van Riper, Respondent, v. Constitutional Government League, Appellant.\"], \"opinions\": [{\"text\": \"Steinert, J.\\nPlaintiff brought suit to recover judgment upon a death benefit certificate issued by defendant. The action was resisted upon the ground that the death of the decedent was caused by acts which were specifically excepted from the risks assumed in the certificate. Trial before the court without a jury resulted in findings, conclusions, and judgment in favor of plaintiff. Defendant has appealed.\\nAppellant, designating itself as a political, educational, benevolent, analytical, and non-profit corporation, was incorporated in this state under and by virtue of Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7\\u00a7 3872-3883 [P. C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 4619-4630], inclusive. As a part of its regular business, it receives individual applications for registration with the corporation, and, in connection therewith, charges registration fees and also semi-annual dues.\\nFor the purpose of assisting widows, orphans, and other persons dependent upon deceased registrants, it creates and maintains a number of death benefit funds which are financed and supported by registration fees, semi-annual dues for overhead expenses, and fixed contributions from each member of so-called \\u201cmutual benevolent\\u201d groups composed of not more than five hundred registrants. The purpose of the plan is to provide the benefits of life insurance to the registrants composing the groups, on a mutually cooperative basis. Upon the death of a registrant, his named beneficiary becomes entitled to an amount represented by the collection of one dollar from each contributing registrant within the particular group.\\nOn January 25, 1936, appellant issued a certificate of registration to William Edmund Van Riper, a barber, residing at Pontiac, Michigan. Respondent was designated as his beneficiary. The certificate, which entitled the registrant to participate in two groups, has at all times since been in full force and effect.\\nThis controversy grows out of the following provision of the certificate, the material part of which, so far as this action is concerned, appears in italics:\\n\\u201cIt is agreed and understood that in the absence of fraud, the sum available under any Benevolent Group shall be incontestable and absolutely free from any conditions as to residence, travel, place or manner of death, except suicide or death due to acts committed in criminal violation of law, including picketing, or the use of intoxicating liquor or narcotics.\\u201d (Italics ours.)\\nRegistrant William E. Van Riper met his death in an automobile accident in Michigan on the night of October 17, 1937. It appears from the evidence that, at about 6:30 p. m., Mr. Van Riper, accompanied by his wife and three daughters, was driving west along a graveled county road, approaching a paved arterial highway. The night had become dark and foggy, after a light rain earlier in the evening. A stop sign was posted at the edge of the graveled road about two hundred feet east of the arterial highway. Mr. Van Riper failed to heed the warning sign and drove into the intersection at an excessive rate of speed. In attempting to make a sharp turn to the left within the intersection, he lost control of his car, which skidded and collided with another car proceeding south along the arterial highway. As a result of the collision, Mr. Van Riper received injuries from which he died that night.\\nThere was no proof of the traffic law of the state of Michigan, and, hence, it must be presumed to be the same as the traffic law of this state.\\nAssuming, then, as we must, that the relevant law of Michigan is the same as the Washington motor vehicle act (Laws of 1937, chapter 189, p. 835; Rem. Rev. Stat., Vol. 7A, \\u00a7\\u00a7 6360-1 to 6360-154, inclusive), it is clear from the evidence that Mr. Van Riper violated a number of its provisions. By \\u00a7 150 of the Washington law, p. 929 (Rem. Rev. Stat., Vol. 7A, \\u00a7 6360-150 [P. C. \\u00a7 2696-765]), the violation of any provision of the act constitutes a misdemeanor unless otherwise declared to be a felony or gross misdemeanor. It is not contended herein that the violations committed by Mr. Van Riper constituted more than mere misdemeanors.\\nProceeding, then, from the premise that Mr. Van Riper was guilty of negligence which proximately caused his death, and that his violations of the statute constituted misdemeanors, we have for decision but one question, namely, whether his violations were \\u201ccriminal\\u201d and fell within the exception of the provision quoted above.\\nWhile the certificate in question is not, strictly speaking, an insurance policy, it is similar to it in nature, and its provisions with reference to liability for death benefits are subject to the same rules as are applicable to analogous provisions in policies of insurance. 1 Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance Law, 335, \\u00a7 168; 2 Cooley\\u2019s Briefs on Insurance (2d ed.), 971; 45 C. J. 21, 22, \\u00a720.\\nThe rule is well settled generally that a condition voiding a life insurance policy if the death of the insured is caused by, or is the direct result of, the violation of any law, is a valid enforceable provision. 6 Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance Law, 4511 et seq., \\u00a7 1236; 6 Cooley\\u2019s Briefs on Insurance (2d ed.), 5201 to 5215. Some of the cases recognizing that a traffic violation is a \\u201cviolation of law\\u201d within the meaning of such an exemption clause in an insurance policy are the following: Davilla v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 114 Cal. App. 308, 299 Pac. 831; Rowe v. United Commercial Travelers Ass\\u2019n, 186 Iowa 454, 172 N. W. 454, 4 A. L. R. 1235; Lamb v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., 129 Kan. 234, 282 Pac. 699; Witt v. Spot Cash Ins. Co., 128 Kan. 155, 276 Pac. 804; Ayres v. Atlas Ins. Co., 123 Neb. 285, 242 N. W. 604; Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Grimsley, 160 Va. 325, 168 S. E. 329; Flannagan v. Provident Life & Acc. Ins. Co. (C. C. A.), 22 F. (2d) 136; Provident Life & Acc. Ins. Co. v. Eaton (C. C. A.), 84 F. (2d) 528.\\nHowever, the authorities just cited are not controlling of the question here, for the reason that the exception in the certificate under consideration was not for \\u201ca violation of law,\\u201d nor for \\u201cany violation of law,\\u201d but for \\u201cacts committed in criminal violation of law.\\u201d The appellant in this case chose to use the more restricted phrase in its certificate.\\nThe question, then, is, whether the meaning of the conventional phrase \\u201cin violation of law,\\u201d or its equivalent, as generally used, was changed by the insertion of the word \\u201ccriminal\\u201d before the word \\u201cviolation.\\u201d\\nA crime is defined by Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 2253 [P. C. \\u00a7 8688], as an act or omission forbidden by law and punishable upon conviction by death, imprisonment, fine, or other penal discipline. Any violation of the traffic law referred to above is expressly made a misdemeanor at least, and is, therefore, in the technical, legal sense, a crime. In this case, however, we are concerned primarily with the interpretation of a phrase used in an insurance contract rather than with the law pertaining to crimes. This is an action arising upon contract; it is not a criminal action.\\nThe language of an insurance policy is to be construed in its plain, ordinary, usual, and popular sense, unless by some known usage it has acquired a different and technical sense. 2 Cooley\\u2019s Briefs on Insurance (2d ed.), 1004; 1 Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance Law, 363, \\u00a7 178; 32 C. J. 1150, \\u00a7 261.\\nIn Dexter Horton Nat. Bank v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 149 Wash. 343, 270 Pac. 799, which was an action brought upon a fidelity bond, we used this language:\\n\\u201cIt is true that the technical rules governing a criminal prosecution are not applicable to such a case as this. It is also true that in order to hold the surety upon such a bond as is here sued upon, the claimant need not produce testimony which satisfies the court or jury beyond a reasonable doubt of the truth of the facts upon which his claim is based, and that words such as \\u2018embezzlement\\u2019 or \\u2018forgery,\\u2019 when contained in a bond like the one upon which this action is based, shall be deemed to have been used in their general and popular sense rather than with specific reference to some statutory definition. Mitchell Grain & Supply Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co. of Baltimore, 108 Kan. 379, 195 Pac. 978, 16 A. L. R. 1488.\\u201d\\nThe word \\u201ccriminal\\u201d is defined in Webster\\u2019s International Dictionary as:\\n\\u201c1. Involving, or of the nature of, a crime; as, criminal carelessness; 2. Relating to crime or its punishment, as, criminal action; 3. Guilty of crime or serious offense.\\u201d\\nIn the same work, one of the definitions of \\u201ccrime\\u201d is:\\n\\u201cGross violation of human law, in distinction from a misdemeanor or trespass, or other slight offense. Hence, also, any aggravated offense against morality.\\u201d\\nAlso:\\n\\u201cCrime is strictly a violation of law either human or divine; in present usage the term is commonly applied to grave offenses against the laws of the state.\\u201d\\nFunk and Wagnall\\u2019s New Dictionary defines \\u201ccriminal\\u201d as follows:\\n\\u201c1. Relating to crime, or pertaining to the administration of penal as opposed to civil law; 2. Implying crime or heinous wickedness; of the nature of crime; as, criminal negligence; a criminal intent; 3. Guilty of crime; as, the criminal classes.\\u201d\\nIn the Oxford Dictionary, \\u201ccriminal\\u201d is defined as:\\n\\u201cOf the nature of or involving a crime; more generally, of the nature of a grave offense, wicked.\\u201d\\nWe quote these standard lexicons because they give not only the technical, but also the popular, meaning of the word \\u201ccriminal.\\u201d In consulting such works, the layman would receive the impression, if he did not already have it, that the term \\u201ccriminal\\u201d implies a wicked or heinous act. To say that a layman, such as the registrant or the respondent, would apply the word \\u201ccriminal\\u201d to the act of one who, under the circumstances here present, exceeded a speed limit or failed to stop before entering an arterial highway, is either to ignore the common usage of the term or else to imply that practically everyone who has ever driven an automobile is a criminal.\\nWe believe that the word \\u201ccriminal,\\u201d as used in the certificate, was meant to signify an act done with malicious intent, from evil nature, or with a wrongful disposition to harm or injure other persons or property.

Shepard Steamship Company, Respondent.\"], \"opinions\": [{\"text\": \"Beals, J.\\nPlaintiff, a seaman, instituted this action on his own behalf and as assignee of seven other companion seamen, asking judgment against defendant for wages, subsistence, and transportation from Tacoma to New York, the cause of action being based upon a contract of employment between plaintiff and his assignors, on the one part, and defendant, as owner of the SS \\u201cTimber Rush,\\u201d upon which steamer plaintiff and his assignors shipped as seamen, on the other. In so far as plaintiff and six of his assignors are concerned, the facts are practically identical. The facts in connection with the claim of assignor Walter Anderson differ in some particulars from the others.\\nPrior to March 10, 1938, defendant had entered into an agreement with the \\u201cSailors Union of the Pacific,\\u201d hereinafter referred to as the SUP, an organization having its headquarters on the Pacific coast, by the terms of which agreement the SUP was to act as the bargaining agent for the crew of the \\u201cTimber Rush\\u201d and other vessels owned by defendant. While the contract referred to was still in effect, an election was held under supervision of the national labor relations board, as the result of which election the \\u201cNational Maritime Union,\\u201d hereinafter referred to as the NMU, was certified as representing the sailors and employees of defendant. The SUP, however, contended that its contract with defendant was still effective, and should be carried out.\\nDefendant, contemplating a voyage of its ship \\u201cTimber Rush\\u201d from the Atlantic coast to points on the Pacific coast, signed a crew presented by the NMU, in accordance with the ruling of the NLRB. A rider in the following form was attached to and made a part of the shipping articles, which were signed by plaintiff and his assignors before the United States shipping commissioner, at Philadelphia:\\n\\u201cIn the event the ship is held up or laid up for any reason for which unlicensed personnel are not responsible, the crew will be given wages, subsistence and first-class transportation back to New York.\\u201d\\nIt appears that this was the first voyage undertaken by any ship belonging to defendant where the entire unlicensed personnel was employed on the east coast, and consisted exclusively of members of the NMU. On prior voyages, defendant had hired its seamen from both unions.\\nApril 14, 1938, the \\u201cTimber Rush\\u201d docked at Seattle, where it was met by a large group of SUP members and sympathizers, who established a picket line on the dock. The members of the crew, however, continued without molestation their regular work, and April 16th, the vessel left Seattle for Tacoma, where the balance of the cargo was discharged. On the following day, April 17th, the vessel was fumigated, and the crew necessarily went ashore, returning to the ship either that evening or early the following day. On the morning of April 18th, while the vessel was alongside the dock, the tide being at such a height that it was possible to step from the dock to the ship\\u2019s main deck, a large number of SUP members or sympathizers, the number being variously estimated at from one hundred to two hundred men, came to the dock, groups of them boarding the ship. Later in the morning, more of these men boarded the ship, and when they departed, twenty or so members of the crew, including six of plaintiff\\u2019s assignors, went with them.\\nThe members of the crew did not take their gear with them, those who testified on the trial of this action stating that they were removed and carried to Seattle against their will.\\nOne Dennett, an official of the Committee on Industrial Organization, with which the NMU is affiliated, residing in Seattle, consulted with the members of the crew, urging them to return to the ship and undertaking to insure their safe return. Dennett and one Wright, an agent of defendant, arranged to transport the crew back to the vessel, seven of the seamen agreeing to go, and having been taken in a truck from the Arlington hotel in Seattle to the ship, which they boarded. The trip was made on or about April 22d, under police escort, and without difficulty. Two other members of the crew were returned to the ship by Wright a day or so later, and several days after that four more of the seamen were returned under Wright\\u2019s care, all these trips being made under police escort and without any annoyance. In this manner, thirteen of the twenty members of the crew who had left the ship returned and resumed work.\\nMay 13th, as the result of conferences in the east, the vessel proceeded from Tacoma to Seattle, and upon the vessel\\u2019s arrival in Seattle, the voyage was canceled and the ship anchored in Lake Union.\\nThe wages due plaintiff and his assignors up to April 22d, the date the first group of the crew returned to the ship, were paid to the United States shipping commissioner, who in turn, as the men had been logged as deserters, turned the money over to the United States district court in Tacoma. May 20th, a hearing was had before that court, which found that the men were not deserters and directed that their wages be paid to them. At the time, the court stated that its determination of the issue of desertion was not to be considered res judicata in any later action.\\nThis suit was instituted for the purpose of recovering wages claimed from April 22d to May 13th, and also to recover wages from May 13th, together with transportation back to New York, and subsistence during the period of travel. The action was tried to the court, sitting without a jury, and resulted in the entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law in defendant\\u2019s favor, followed by a judgment dismissing the action, from which plaintiff has appealed.\\nAppellant contends that the court\\u2019s findings of fact are contrary to the evidence, and that the conclusions are contrary to law.\\nThe findings of fact are voluminous and explicit. The court found the making of the contract as above set forth; the ruling of the NLRB, and the hiring of the crew pursuant thereto; that the voyages of respondent\\u2019s ships commence on the east coast, and that, for the voyage in question, respondent hired for the \\u201cTimber Rush\\u201d a crew belonging to the NMU, in accordance with the certificate of the NLRB; that the SUP had disagreed with the ruling of the NLRB, and decided that they had a grievance against respondent, that members of their union should have been hired for the voyage in question, and that, for this reason, when the ship arrived at Seattle, the SUP caused the vessel to be picketed; that the dispute was entirely between the two unions involved, over a jurisdictional matter as to which was the proper union to furnish crews for respondent\\u2019s vessels, and particularly for the \\u201cTimber Rush.\\u201d\\nThe court then found other facts as above stated, and that, on the morning after the ship was fumigated, a considerable number of the pickets boarded the vessel and forced most of the deck crew to leave; that there was no fighting, but that the men left under threats or intimidation; that appellant\\u2019s assignors, with the exception of Walter Anderson, left the vessel with the pickets at this time, but that appellant himself and Anderson left later; that, under instructions from a member of the Tacoma police squad, the captain of the ship talked to one Joseph E. Dunn, a member of the crew, and one of appellant\\u2019s assignors, who acted as spokesman for the crew, asking him if the men wanted to return to the ship, and that Mr. Dunn replied that the crew did not care to go back on board; that the men were then, by the SUP, taken to Seattle, where they were lodged at the expense of the SUP.\\nThe court further found that appellant himself left the ship on the evening of April 18th, and \\\"that assignor Anderson left at nine o\\u2019clock the following morning; that both of these men left voluntarily; that Anderson subsequently entered the Marine hospital at Seattle, but that the record contains no evidence that he advised the master of his intention to seek hospitalization, or that he, until after May 13th, ever told the master that he had been in the hospital; that a total of thirteen members of the crew returned to the ship and performed their duties, and that these men were not in any way molested or caused any inconvenience or difficulty whatsoever.\\nFindings Nos. 8 and 9 read as follows:\\n\\u201c(8) That the plaintiff and plaintiff\\u2019s assignors at all times refused to return to the ship and refused to avail themselves of the arrangements made by the defendant for their return to the vessel; that the said seven (7) men, plaintiff and plaintiff\\u2019s assignors herein, who failed and refused to return to the ship were also urged by their union representative, Mr. Eugene Victor Dennett, to return to the vessel, but they still refused to do so.\\n\\u201c(9) That the S. S. Timber Rush remained at Tacoma until the early morning of May 13, 1938, during which time the members of the crew who returned to the vessel worked upon said vessel and encountered no trouble or difficulty whatsoever, that no attempt was made to load cargo on said vessel after approximately April 26, 1938, that the longshoremen refused at all times subsequent to April 18, 1938, to load said vessel; that at said time said vessel sailed for Seattle and because of insufficient crew on board said vessel to man said vessel, was required to tie up in Lake Union at Seattle; that a fine was imposed upon the master of the Timber Rush by the United States Customs for bringing said vessel from Tacoma to Seattle without a full crew, which fine was subsequently remitted; that on May 13, 1938, the seven (7) members of the crew involved in this action, not having returned to the ship at the time 'it sailed from Tacoma, and having been gone from said vessel since April 18, 1938, were each logged as deserters by the master of the vessel.\\u201d\\nThe court then found that the members of the crew who returned to the ship were paid off and furnished transportation and subsistence to New York; that the wages due appellant and his assignors were paid up to April 22d, and that the men received these wages under order of the United States district court; that these men never returned to the ship until after it was laid up in Lake Union, when they went on board and removed their personal belongings.\\nFindings Nos. 13 and 14 read as follows:\\n\\u201c(13) That the failure of the plaintiff and plaintiff\\u2019s assignors to return to their vessel was due either to sympathy on their part with the picketing of the vessel, or a disinclination on their part to pass through a picket line, even though it was maintained by a rival or competing union organization; that the plaintiff and plaintiff\\u2019s assignors after leaving the vessel did not thereafter intend to return to said vessel until the difficulties with the Sailors\\u2019 Union of the Pacific had been adjusted and settled, and that by reason of the failure of the plaintiff and plaintiff\\u2019s assignors to return to the vessel the said vessel was compelled to lay up at Seattle.\\n\\u201c(14) That there was in this case no labor dispute between the defendant and the seamen employed by it, to-wit, plaintiff and plaintiff\\u2019s assignors, but there was merely a jurisdictional dispute between two rival or competing labor organizations.\\u201d\\nThe court then concluded that appellant and his assignors had breached their contract; that they had received from respondent all sums due them; that they themselves were responsible for the abandonment of the voyage; that they were entitled to recover nothing from respondent; and that respondent was entitled to judgment dismissing the action. Judgment of dismissal was accordingly entered.\\nIt appears that, during the past few years, a rider similar to that made a part of the shipping articles in the case at bar has been very generally used as a part of similar articles.\\nIn defending the action, respondent relied upon three propositions: First, that appellant and his assignors had deserted the ship; second, that appellant and his assignors violated their contract, as embodied in the shipping articles; and third, that the voyage was canceled and the vessel laid up because of the fault of appellant and his assignors; respondent contending that for one or all of these reasons, appellant was not entitled to judgment. It is, of course, admitted that the men were paid in full up to April 22d.\\nWe find it unnecessary to discuss the question of whether or not appellant and his assignors deserted the ship, and upon that question we express no opinion.\\nAppellant argues that under Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 4596, 46 U. S. C. A., \\u00a7 701, entitled \\u201cOffenses and Punishments,\\u201d the men incurred no greater penalty than forfeiture of two days pay. We are convinced that this section of the statute does not cover such a situation as is here presented.\\nAppellant then argues that the men were justified in their refusal to return to the ship, contending that their refusal to avail themselves of the opportunity which was afforded them to return to the ship does not constitute such a breach of contract as deprives them of the benefit of their contract. Appellant argues that the men had reasonable grounds to apprehend physical danger should they return to the ship, calling attention to the fact that their return would have been under police protection.\\nIn this connection, appellant cites the case of Ward v. Ames, 9 Johnson (N. Y.) 138, decided in 1812, in which it was held that a seaman who, during a voyage, left the ship on account of ill usage by the mate and the master, the man having been beaten by the mate, and who was in fear of further ill usage and impressment upon a British man-of-war, was not a deserter, but was entitled to recover full wages for the entire voyage. Appellant frankly states that this case is more nearly comparable to the case at bar than any other he has been able to find, but it is not in point here, as a seaman who has been beaten by one of the ship\\u2019s officers, who, with the connivance of the master, had endeavored to have the man pressed for service upon a foreign war ship, certainly could not be required or expected to continue the voyage.\\nRespondent cites the case of Scully v. The Great Republic, 21 Fed. Cas. 895. The libelant shipped for a round trip voyage from California to Hongkong. During a call at Yokohama, the seaman went on shore and failed to return before the ship sailed. A month later, the ship again stopped at Yokohama, and the seaman sought to return, but the master refused permission. It was held that the seaman was not entitled to recover his wages, having breached the contract of employment. In the course of the opinion, the court said:\\n\\u201cThe effect of a failure on the part of the mariner to render himself on board the ship, in consequence of which she departs without him, is to discharge the master from the obligations of the contract, and this whether the failure be caused by vis major, or by the seaman\\u2019s fault.\\u201d\\nIt was held that the seaman was not a deserter, and was entitled to wages earned up to the time he left the ship.\\nIt has several times been held that a seaman who absents himself without leave and does not return to the ship by sailing time, under circumstances not amounting to desertion, may recover the amount of his wages actually earned, but is not entitled to wages for the balance of the voyage covered by the shipping articles. Johnson v. Blanchard, 7 Fed. 597; Brink v. Lyons, 18 Fed. 605; McKinnon v. The Reed Case, 39 Fed. 624.\\nIn the case of The Leiderhorn, 99 Fed. 1001, it was held that the seaman was entitled to no recovery. In the case of The Leiderhorn and in the case of McKinnon v. The Reed Case, supra, the seaman absented himself as the result of a fight with another member of the crew on shipboard. In each case, it appeared that the master had requested the seaman to return, assuring him that he would suffer no further violence.\\nIn Buchanan v. United States, 24 F. (2d) 528, it appeared that the ship called at a port in the Philippine Islands. Several members of the crew subsequently libeled the vessel for wages, it appearing that they intentionally overstayed their time on shore, believing that the ship would not sail without them. The ship, however, sailed at the appointed hour, hiring new seamen at another port. It was held that the men were not deserters, having had no intention of leaving the ship permanently, and were entitled to their earned wages. It was also held that their breach of contract precluded their recovery of anything save wages earned prior to the time the ship sailed.\\nIn the matter of The City of Norwich, 279 Fed. 687, the rule is laid down that before a seaman may recover wages, it must appear\\n\\u201c . . . not only that there was a valid contract of employment, but that he has performed his contract until the voyage was completed, or his term of service expired, or show some legal and sufficient excuse for nonperformance.\\u201d\\nIn the case of United States v. Smith, 12 F. (2d) 265, involving a libel for wages, upon the ground that a demand for half wages had been wrongfully refused, and that for this reason the members of the crew were entitled to full wages, it was held by the circuit court of appeals, in reversing the district court, that the libelants were deserters and entitled to nothing. The district court had allowed recovery upon a theory not stated in the libel. In reversing the decree, the appellate court said:\\n\\u201cRecovery was had on a state of facts different from that relied on in the libel, namely, that the danger of violence at the hands of strikers excused libelants from performing their contract. It was not even suggested in the libel that there was any such danger. Aside from that, it is not claimed in the testimony that the crew would have been in any danger whatever if they had remained on board, nor that the ship was unable or unwilling to afford them full protection against violence.\\u201d\\nIn the case at bar, the findings of the trial court are supported by the evidence. Thirteen of the members of the crew returned to the ship without molestation, and were not again disturbed in their work.\\nThe shipping articles which constitute the contract between the parties bound the seamen who signed them to perform their full duty to the ship. If seamen landing from a vessel are involved in any altercation while on shore, whether based on purely personal grounds or any other not involving violation of law on their part, they are at all times entitled to the protection of the authorities to and on the ship, and unless they have reasonable grounds for anticipating violence while on the ship thereafter, they are not justified in abandoning the ship.\\nThe contract between the parties is simple and does not require construction. It is only necessary to determine whether or not the facts shown in the particular case come within the terms of the rider.\\nIn the case of John Landro v. Pacific Atlantic S. S. Co., cause No. 13920, before the United States district court for the' western district of Washington, northern division, Neterer, District Judge, filed an opinion November 27, 1937. The case is unreported, but the opinion is of record in the court files. From the opinion, it appears that the libelant and other members of the crew signed shipping articles on the ship \\u201cSan Angelo\\u201d for a voyage from Seattle to Philadelphia and return. A rider somewhat similar to that here in question was made part of the shipping articles. Upon arrival of the ship at Philadelphia, the ship was picketed, apparently because the seamen\\u2019s own union had declared a strike. The men then refused to work, and were paid off. Landro and several assignors claimed further compensation, but the district court concluded that there was nothing in the record showing that the crew left the ship for a reason for which they were not responsible, and that the vessel was not laid up, within the provisions of the rider. As stated by Judge Neterer,\\n\\u201cThe libelant and assignors may not enter into a relation or status and by their own acts bring about conditions violative of their engagement in the shipping articles.\\u201d\\nIn the case of The San Angelo, 1937 A. M. C. 1303 [U. S. Dist. Ct.], in which a rider similar to that contained in the articles in the case at bar was part of the articles, it appeared that a crew refused to work on board a vessel because the ship was picketed, with the result that the ship was tied up and the voyage abandoned. It was held that the seamen were entitled to no recovery.\\nWe are convinced that appellant and his assignors had no legal excuse for refusing to return to the ship, and breached their contracts, and that the trial court correctly held that they are not entitled to recover in this action.\\nThe cases of appellant Barfknecht and assignor Walter Anderson require some slight discussion. Anderson was not taken from the ship when the other members of the crew left on the 18th. He left the ship the following morning of his own volition, taking his personal effects with him. He was then taken to Seattle by the pickets. He returned to the dock at which the ship was tied up, April 22d, and talked to the captain, who told him to come back, but, as Anderson testified, \\u201cThere were several pickets around there, and they were not in favor of it.\\u201d On other occasions, Anderson came to the dock, but was told by the pickets not to go on board the ship, which instructions he obeyed. He had a hospital slip which he had obtained at some prior time, and May 13th he entered the Marine Hospital in Seattle, where he remained until June 2d. Appellant contends that, because Anderson was in the hospital when the voyage was canceled, he is entitled to recover maintenance and wages to the end of the voyage, citing authorities. The cases cited do not support Anderson\\u2019s contention in the case at bar. Anderson is no more entitled to recover than are his associates.\\nAppellant Barfknecht left the vessel voluntarily during the course of the evening of April 18th. When he tried to return to the ship that evening, he was stopped by the pickets, whereupon he went to Seattle. April 22d he returned to the dock and told the pickets he wanted to board the ship for the purpose of procuring a hospital certificate. This he obtained from the captain and returned to Seattle, but he at no time entered the hospital. He made no serious attempt to return to the ship, and clearly was guilty of a breach of contract. During most of the time after the men were taken to Seattle, there were no more than eight or ten pickets on the dock.\\nThe findings made by the trial court are amply supported by the evidence. The court properly concluded from the findings that appellant and his assignor^ were not entitled to any recovery, and the judgment dismissing the action is accordingly affirmed.\\nBlake, C.

Moran et al., Appellants.\"], \"opinions\": [{\"text\": \"Geraghty, J.\\nThis action arises out of a collision between two automobiles at the intersection of Rucker avenue and Nineteenth street, in the city of Everett. The plaintiff sued for personal injuries and property damage sustained by him, resulting from the alleged negligent driving of the defendant Charles G. Moran. Trial of the cause to a jury resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. After denial of a motion for new trial, judgment was entered upon the verdict.\\nThe errors assigned by the appellants for reversal of the judgment are based upon the court\\u2019s refusal to admit testimony offered by them tending to show that they did not know that Nineteenth was an arterial street; and that, by reason of an obstruction to their view, caused by an automobile and truck parked \\u201calongside and near to the arterial sign,\\u201d they could not see it, and drove into the intersection believing they were entitled to the right of way over any traffic approaching from their left.\\nNineteenth street is an arterial way running east and west; Rucker avenue runs north and south. The collision occurred as the respondent was driving west on Nineteenth street and the appellants south on Rucker avenue. A stop sign, of the proper height and design, was in place on the west side of Rucker avenue, a short distance north of the intersection.\\nIt is undisputed that appellants\\u2019 car was driven into the arterial street without stopping, and the jury must have found, under the court\\u2019s instructions, that this was the proximate cause of the accident.\\nWhile Mr. Moran was on the stand, his counsel offered to prove by him that he did not know that Nineteenth was an arterial street and, for this reason, he did not stop;\\n\\u201c. . . that after the accident had occurred his attention was called to the fact that it was an arterial stop; that he then went over to the corner to see the sign, and at that time there were two cars parked right against it, where it made it impossible for a driver of a car going in the direction he was going to see the sign.\\u201d\\nThe court sustained an objection to the offer. Later, while Mrs. Moran was on the stand, counsel made a similar offer of proof, to which the court sustained an objection in so far as the testimony was intended to show that the driver could not see the stop sign. Mr. Moran was then recalled and asked if there were any cars parked on the west side of Rucker avenue as he approached Nineteenth street, and, if so, to indicate on a map in evidence where they were. Counsel for respondent objected to the testimony if offered for the purpose of the former offer, saying that, if the offer was made as preliminary to something else, he had no objection. Counsel for appellants then stated that his only purpose was to show that the cars were so parked that the driver could not see the sign; whereupon the court sustained the objection.\\nRem. Rev. Stat., Vol. 7A, \\u00a7 6360-106 [P. C. \\u00a7 2696-864], after providing for the designation of arterial highways and the posting of signs, of the standard design adopted by the director of highways, continues:\\n\\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person operating any vehicle when entering any intersection determined, designated and bearing the sign aforesaid, to fail and neglect to bring such vehicle to a complete stop before entering such intersection.\\u201d\\nIn Washington v. Seattle, 170 Wash. 371, 16 P. (2d) 597, 86 A. L. R. 113, error was assigned upon the giving of an instruction, the first paragraph of which follows:\\n\\u201c \\u2018You are instructed that if you find that the stop sign was erected and standing at said alleged intersection and that defendant John Claseman, immediately preceding said collision, was aware of the presence and existence of said stop sign, or, acting as a reasonable and ordinary prudent person under like or similar circumstances, would have been aware of the same, or should have seen said stop sign, then said John Claseman would be negligent if he failed to stop at said stop sign, provided you believe that an ordinarily careful and prudent person, under like or similar circumstances, in the exercise of reasonable care, would have stopped at said stop sign.\\u2019 \\u201d\\nPassing upon the instruction, this court said:\\n\\u201cThe first paragraph of the instruction relates to respondent Claseman. We think that it was erroneous in two respects: First, it submitted to the jury the existence of the stop sign as a question of fact, whereas its existence was admitted by the answers of both respondents.\\n\\u201cSecond, it made obedience to the ordinance which required respondent Claseman to stop, a matter of discretion on his part, rather than a positive duty.\\n\\u201cThe law did not permit him to govern his action merely by the exercise of reasonable care; it required him to stop. If the ordinance is to be construed as the instruction construes it, there would rarely be a case where a driver would be guilty of negligence in failing to stop, for he could always seek refuge in the assertion that reasonable care did not call for compliance with the ordinance. The law in this respect says positively what the care to be exercised by the driver is, and does not leave it to speculation, or even to the driver\\u2019s judgment.\\u201d\\nIt is a maxim that ignorance of the law excuses no man; not that all men know the law, but because \\u201c \\u2019tis an excuse every man will plead, and no man can tell how to confute him.\\u201d\\nWhen the proper authority has established an arterial highway and notified its existence to the public by the erection of a stop sign, any one approaching the arterial from an intersecting street is presumed to know that it is such and required to obey the statutory injunction to stop. He cannot be heard to say he did not know of the existence of the sign, or that he could not see it.\\nThe proof offered by the appellants, which the court refused, tended to show that, after the accident, they left their car and went back to the stop sign, where they saw the parked cars. A lesser measure of care before the accident would have disclosed the existence of the sign. The respondent, driving on the arterial street, for whose protection the stop sign was posted, had a right to assume that the law would be obeyed. If the appellants could have excused their failure to stop by showing that parked cars interfered with their seeing the sign, other drivers failing to stop could, with equal reason, urge that their view was interrupted by passing vehicles to their right. The purpose of the law can be accomplished only by imputing to the driver knowledge of the existence of the sign and full responsibility for failure to stop before entering the arterial.\\nThe appellants rely on Lyle v. Fiorito, 187 Wash. 537, 60 P. (2d) 709, and Baldwin v. Washington Motor Coach Co., 196 Wash. 117, 82 P. (2d) 131. Neither of these cases is controlling here.\\nIn the first of these cases, the court sustained a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against King county for the death of her husband, resulting from a traffic accident in an arterial intersection. The county had permitted the road entering the arterial to remain unmarked, and, by reason of this lack of notice, the deceased drove into the arterial way without stopping. The court held that the county was under a statutory duty to maintain a stop sign, and that its failure to do so was actionable negligence. In the course of its opinion, the court said:\\n\\u201cUnder the law, traffic approaching an arterial from an intersecting street must yield the right of way, regardless of the general rule. This exception to the law giving the driver on the right the preference becomes an absolute menace unless drivers approaching an arterial are warned of that fact. This is demonstrated by the facts in the case at bar.\\u201d\\nIn the Baldwin case, the facts were that one of the defendant\\u2019s busses had knocked down a stop sign. Two days later, the sign not having been restored, an accident occurred in the arterial intersection, resulting in the death of Mrs. Gollofon. Her administratrix brought an action against the motor coach company for damages, alleging that the accident resulted from the absence of the stop sign. The jury having returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, a new trial was granted for error in the giving of a faulty instruction. On plaintiff\\u2019s appeal, the order granting a new trial was affirmed. The challenged instruction told the jury, in effect, that the defendant would not be liable if the sign was knocked down \\u201c \\\"without negligence on its part.\\u2019 \\u201d\\nIn the course of its opinion affirming the order, the court reaffirmed the rule that the violation of a statute intended to prevent injury to persons or property constituted negligence per se and, if it contributed proximately to injury, is actionable; but said that, if the respondent was not guilty of any negligence in knocking the sign down, and did not know that it was knocked down,\\n\\u201c. . . at most it could not be guilty of more than a technical violation of the statute and ordinance in question. To excuse the respondent for this technical violation, which resulted from a cause\\u2014the negligence of Schmidt\\u2014beyond respondent\\u2019s control, would not necessarily enunciate a principle inconsistent with the rule that violation of a statute is negligence per se, and may be taken\\n\\u201c . . merely as an assertion of the rule that statutes are to be reasonably construed and that a statutory duty may be modified by the peculiar circumstances of a particular case.\\u2019 45 C. J. 732.\\u201d\\nThe peculiar circumstances of that case, which the court held to warrant a modification of a statutory duty, are not present here. We conclude that the court correctly refused the proof offered by appellants in exculpation of their violation of the statute.\\nThe appellants complain that, while the court refused evidence tending to show they could not see the sign, it allowed the respondent, in making his case in chief, to show the conditions surrounding the intersection, including parked cars and the existence of a stop sign, thus opening up the subject so as to entitle appellants to present counter evidence. But, in denying appellants\\u2019 offer of proof for the purpose stated, the court said they might show the surrounding conditions, including parked cars, if any there were, but not for the purpose of proving they could not see the stop sign. Their tender of proof, in the circumstances of the case, was properly refused as being immaterial, since it would not excuse their failure to stop.\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\nBlake, C.

July 7, 1931, the state, acting through Harry C. Johnson, the then director of efficiency, who was of the opinion that the association was insolvent, closed the association and took possession of its assets. Finding that the association was, in fact, insolvent, Mr. Johnson called upon the directors to place it in a sound condition and, upon their failure so to do, filed a petition in the superior court, asking that he be appointed receiver. By order dated November 7, 1931, Mr. Johnson was appointed receiver, this court on appeal affirming the order of appointment. In re Home Savings & Loan Ass\\u2019n, 165 Wash. 351, 5 P. (2d) 511.\\nDecember 2, 1931, the superior court entered an order dissolving the association, whereupon the receiver discharged the directors. Ever since that time, the association has been in receivership, under the direction of the superior court for King county, the matter for several years having, by assignment, pertained to the department of the superior court presided over by Judge Clay Allen. The present receiver is Victor G. Skinner, state supervisor of savings and loan associations, who was appointed March 16, 1938.\\nIt appears that, after the director of efficiency had closed the association, a new board of directors was chosen, which was at least tentatively recognized by the director, who later, as above stated, applied for appointment as receiver of the association.\\nIn 1933, the legislature enacted two laws concerning savings and loan associations, one entitled \\u201cSavings and Loan Association Act,\\u201d being Laws of 1933, chapter 183, p. 711 (Rem. Rev. Stat. (Sup.), \\u00a7 3717-1 [P. C. \\u00a7 4564-1] et seq.); the other covering the matter of the liquidation of insolvent associations, being Laws of 1933, chapter 93, p. 395 (Rem. Rev. Stat. (Sup.), \\u00a7 3735-1 et seq.). In 1935, an amendment to the former act was passed, being Laws of 1935, chapter 171, p. 597, \\u00a74 (Rem. Rev. Stat. (Sup.), \\u00a7 3717-78 [P. C. \\u00a74564-97]).\\nDuring the year 1934, an action was brought for the purpose of rescinding a contract for two deposits with the association, the association and its receiver and liquidator being named as defendants. The superior court dismissed the action, and on appeal this judgment was affirmed by this court. Rummens v. Home Savings & Loan Ass\\u2019n, 182 Wash. 539, 47 P. (2d) 845, 100 A. L. R. 570. This court in its opinion laid down the rule that a savings and loan association is deemed insolvent when it cannot pay back to its members their deposits, dollar for dollar.\\nA group of shareholders, purporting to act for the association, met December 9, 1935, elected a board of directors, and voted in favor of reopening the association. A week later, the persons elected as directors at this meeting filed in the receivership proceeding a petition asking that the association be released from liquidation, in order that it might reopen for business. In the course of reaching a final determination upon this petition, Judge Allen indicated that he would call a special meeting of the shareholders, to express their views on the question of reopening, whereupon certain of the shareholders applied to this court for a writ of prohibition to restrain the superior court from proceeding as suggested. The application for the writ was denied (State ex rel. Berger v. Allen, 186 Wash. 403, 58 P. (2d) 293), this court holding that, under existing statutes, the superior court had jurisdiction to proceed in accordance with the plan outlined; that the corporate existence of the association continued; and that the association might, under certain circumstances, be permitted, under \\u00a7 3717-78, above referred to, to proceed by way of self-liquidation.\\nJune 20, 1936, an order was entered by the superior court calling a special shareholders meeting for July 20-21, to consider the matter of reopening the association or leaving the same in liquidation under the direction of the supervisor and the control of the superior court. The notice also provided for the election of a board of directors. Notice of the meeting was mailed to each shareholder, the meeting was held, and a report of the proceedings filed in the cause by persons appointed by the court to conduct the meeting. The shareholders present at the meeting voted by a large majority that the association remain in liquidation, under control of the court. Six persons were elected directors, five of whom qualified, whose election was confirmed by court order.\\nDuring the month of October, 1936, certain of the association\\u2019s shareholders filed in the receivership proceeding a petition, praying that the receiver be discharged, the receivership terminated, and control of the corporation returned to its shareholders; that the persons elected directors at the meeting held December 9, 1935, be declared to be the legally elected directors of the association; and that the election held July 21, 1936, pursuant to the court\\u2019s order, be declared to be illegal and void. The petitioners alleged that the ballots used at the latter meeting were confusing; that some shareholders had made false charges against other shareholders; that proxies had been wrongfully secured and used; and that it should be held that fraud had been practiced upon the shareholders. A demurrer to this petition was sustained, and the petition dismissed. On appeal to this court, the order dismissing the petition was affirmed. In re Home Savings & Loan Ass\\u2019n, 189 Wash. 442, 65 P. (2d) 1249.\\nMay 13, 1937, certain shareholders petitioned the superior court for an order setting aside the removal of the board of directors by the first receiver, Johnson, and asked that that board be declared to be the legal board of directors. A demurrer to this petition was by the superior court sustained, this ruling not having been reviewed before this court.\\nJuly 25, 1938, some of these same stockholders, claiming to be directors of the association, called a meeting of the shareholders, sending out, as they testified, approximately three hundred notices of the meeting. Approximately two hundred fifty out of the nineteen thousand shareholders attended the meeting, 3,586 shares voting that the association reopen and 386 shares voting against that proposition. The receiver was duly notified of this meeting, but apparently took no action.\\nAugust 1, 1938, this cause was instituted before the superior court for Thurston county, by way of a proceeding in mandamus, the complaint alleging the corporate existence of the association; that defendant Victor Skinner, as state supervisor of building and loan associations, was acting as liquidator of the association; that L. F. Lane and six other persons were the elected and qualified directors of the association; that Mr. Johnson had been appointed receiver, as above set forth; that the association still owned assets of the value of a million and a half dollars; that the shareholders had ordered other assets charged off and the association reopened; that the board of directors referred to in the petition had called a meeting of the shareholders for July 25, 1938, the date fixed by the by-laws of the association for its annual meeting; and that, at the meeting so called, 3,622 votes were cast in favor of reopening (the number of votes alleged to have been cast in favor of reopening differing slightly from the number as alleged in the notice to the receiver) and 386 votes against reopening, but that the liquidator refused to return the assets to the association or to permit the same to reopen. The petition prayed that a writ of mandate issue, directed to defendant Victor Skinner, commanding him to account to the association and turn over such an account, with all the remaining assets belonging to the association, to the board of directors.\\nAfter due proceedings, the action was transferred to King county for trial, and an order was entered permitting Charles E. Stutz and five other persons to intervene in the action, they being the directors of the association who had been elected at the meeting called by the court July 21, 1936.\\nThe cause was tried before Honorable Chester A. Batchelor, judge of the superior court for King county, sitting without a jury, and resulted in findings of fact and conclusions of law in favor of defendant and inter-veners, followed by a judgment dismissing the proceeding, from which judgment this appeal has been prosecuted.\\nAppellant assigns error upon the refusal of the trial court to grant the writ of mandate prayed for; upon the making of the findings of fact and conclusions of law; upon the refusal of the court to enter findings of fact proposed by appellant; upon the entry of judgment of dismissal; upon the denial of appellant\\u2019s motion for a new trial; and upon the refusal of the trial court to allow, as a charge against the receivership, the costs of the shareholders meeting. Appellant also assigns error upon the admission of an exhibit offered by respondent.\\nAppellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting in evidence a copy of the letter dated December 2, 1931, written by Mr. Johnson, state director of efficiency, and on that date receiver of the association, discharging the then directors of the association. Appellant argues that the record contains no evidence that the notice of removal was sent to three members of the board of directors, or, indeed, that the notice was ever issued by the director of efficiency as supervisor. Appellant also argues that the notice was based upon an order dissolving the association, and that this order was later set aside by judicial decree.\\nTwo of the directors of the association, who were such prior to December, 1931, testifying in this proceeding, stated that they had been discharged as directors, and one of them testified that three other directors had received similar notices of discharge. The record contains other testimony to the same effect. The record also discloses that several times it was contended before the superior court that the discharge of the board of directors, as the same had been constituted prior to December, 1931, was illegal and void, and that the matter was determined contrary to such contention.\\nOn the other hand, it is contended, on behalf of appellant, that the opinion of this court in the case of State ex rel. Berger v. Allen, 186 Wash. 403, 58 P. (2d) 293, supra, necessarily implies that the old board of directors was still functioning. In the cited case, it was held that the association had not been completely dissolved and terminated, but that the association as a legal entity still existed. The opinion in the case cited does not support appellant\\u2019s contention. No question was presented as to what persons constituted the board of directors, and the opinion did not decide that question.\\nThe exhibit offered had some probative value, and the court did not err in receiving it. We are convinced that the record amply supports the proposition that the members of the board of directors were discharged early in December, 1931, and that this question is no longer open to judicial inquiry.\\nIt is evident that the association\\u2019s shareholders have been divided into three groups: One, represented by appellants, in favor of charging off losses and reopening the association; another in favor of continuing the liquidation of the assocation through the receiver and under the direction of the court, this group represented by interveners; and the third group indifferent and taking little interest in the matter. As above indicated, matters concerning the association have given rise to much litigation and several appeals to this court.\\nIn the case at bar, the trial court very patiently heard the evidence, permitting the parties to introduce numerous exhibits and much testimony. At the close of the case, the court pronounced a comprehensive oral summation of the evidence, containing an able analysis thereof, and clearly stating its conclusions. Later, explicit findings of fact were signed, followed by the court\\u2019s conclusion that the case should be dismissed.\\nThe court found that, December 2, 1931, Harry C. Johnson, as director of efficiency of the state of Washington, discharged seven directors of the association, and \\u201cthat no appeal was taken from said discharge as provided by statute, and the same became final;\\u201d that three of the persons instrumental in bringing this action claim to be directors of the association, because they were directors prior to and on December 2, 1931; that four other persons, also instrumental in bringing this action, claim to be directors under appointment to succeed the other discharged directors; but that none of the persons referred to \\u201care or were at the time of the commencement of this action directors of the association;\\u201d and that the persons above referred to had no right to bring this action on behalf of the corporation.\\nThe court further found that, May 13, 1937, there was filed in the receivership proceeding a petition to set aside the notice of removal of the board of directors, dated December 2, 1931, the petitioners alleging that the order of removal was void; that a hearing was had on the petition before the superior court, with the result that an order was entered sustaining a demurrer to the petition and ordering the dismissal thereof; that this order was not appealed from, became final and binding, and constitutes res judicata as to the issue presented.\\nReferring to the meeting of the shareholders called pursuant to order of the superior court dated June 20, 1936, the court found that notice of the meeting was mailed to all shareholders; that an election was held July 21, 1936, pursuant to this notice; that the shareholders voted against reopening the association, against self-liquidation thereof, and in favor of maintaining the association in liquidation under the supervision of the supervisor of savings and loan associations and under control of the superior court; that the results of the election were embodied in an order entered by the superior court April 10, 1937; that all parties interested knew of the entry of the order, but no exceptions were taken thereto and no appeal taken therefrom. In this proceeding, the trial court expressly found that the meeting was impartially and fairly conducted; that at the meeting the interveners herein were elected directors of the association; and that inter-veners were, at the time of the making of the findings, the directors of the association.\\nThe court found that no evidence had been introduced of any changed conditions since the meeting of July 21, 1936, which would require the exercise of any discretion as to the reopening of the association, or that would necessitate the calling of another election; and that the supervisor has not consented to the reopening of the association, the self-liquidation thereof, or the charging off of losses.\\nIn regard to the election of July 25, 1938, the court found that the meeting was not called by the court, the supervisor, or the directors of the association; that the persons who called the meeting were not authorized to call the same; that a very small percentage of the shareholders had notice of the meeting; and that no action taken at the meeting was binding upon the supervisor, the court, or the shareholders, the meeting having been attended by less than two hundred fifty shareholders.\\nThe court further found that respondent Victor Skinner, as director of savings and loan associations and liquidator of this association, has not acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner; that, prior to the commencement of this action, no plan of reorganization of the association had been submitted to Mr. Skinner; and that, as far as the evidence showed, the liquidation of the association had been carried out in an honest and able manner.\\nAppellants do not argue that the appointment of a temporary receiver of the association was wrongful, but they vigorously contend that the receiver should have been discharged long since; that the order of the superior court dated December 2, 1931, dissolving the association, was procured by fraud perpetrated upon the court and constituted a fraud upon the association, the board of directors, and the shareholders.\\nIn the case of State ex rel. Berger v. Allen, 186 Wash. 403, 58 P. (2d) 293, this court held that the order last referred to amounted to no more than a judicial act suspending the association\\u2019s business and. did not have the effect of actually terminating the corporate existence. Concerning this phase of the case, the court said:\\n\\u201cAny other interpretation would not be in consonance with our decision, inasmuch as The Attorney General had not gone so far as to ask for a dissolution of the association, but only that the director of efficiency be appointed receiver, and this court granted no greater relief. Complete dissolution was not sought nor granted. There could be no dissolution, strictly speaking, unless the association had lost all power to continue or to resume its business as a going concern. Considering all of the circumstances, we conclude that the order relied upon as dissolving the association did not have the effect of destroying its juristic entity.\\u201d\\nIn the first place, we are of the opinion that the association was insolvent at the time the director of efficiency closed its doors in July, 1931. On appeal from the order appointing the receiver, this court, In re Home Savings & Loan Ass\\u2019n, 165 Wash. 351, 5 P. (2d) 511, said:\\n\\u201cIt is plain, as we have seen, that the association is hopelessly in an unsound condition; that the association\\u2019s directors have not taken any steps looking to its restoration to a sound condition; that the association\\u2019s unsound condition plainly calls for the liquidation and winding up of its affairs; and that Johnson, as director of efficiency, has not approved of voluntary liquidation.\\u201d\\nIn the case of Rummens v. Home Savings & Loan Ass\\u2019n, 182 Wash. 539, 47 P. (2d) 845, 100 A. L. R. 570, it was again held that the association was insolvent, and the rule stated as follows:\\n\\u201cA savings and loan association is deemed to be insolvent, when it cannot pay back to its members or shareholders the amount of their contributions dollar for dollar.\\u201d\\nAt no time since has the supervisor approved the reopening of the association, its self-liquidation, or the charging off of losses.\\nIn re Home Savings & Loan Ass\\u2019n, 189 Wash. 442, 65 P. (2d) 1249, on appeal from an order dismissing a petition seeking the discharge of the receiver and the return of the control of the corporation to its shareholders, the judgment of dismissal was affirmed, this court holding that the trial court correctly ruled that the petition was insufficient. One of the grounds upon which the petition was held deficient was that it contained no allegation to the effect that the supervisor of savings and loan associations had approved the plan to reopen the corporation as an active association, no legal reason or excuse being alleged for dispensing with such approval.\\nIn the case at bar, the trial court found that the supervisor has not acted arbitrarily or capriciously, and the evidence amply supports this finding.\\nAppellants vigorously attack the legality of the shareholders meeting called under the direction of the superior court, and which met July 20-21, 1936. It is argued that no law authorizes the calling of such a meeting; that the shareholders were not permitted any voice in the plan and management of the meeting; that the appointed chairman of the meeting was not a shareholder; that the supervisor of the election was not a shareholder; that shareholders were intimidated; that they were not permitted to inspect lists of the shareholders; that proxies were solicited from many shareholders and were obtained upon false pretenses. Appellants admit that the majority of votes cast were against discharging the liquidator, but contend that this proposition was defeated by votes cast pursuant to fraudulent proxies and intimidation.\\nIt would seem that the selection of a disinterested and competent person to act as chairman of the meeting, and of another to act as supervisor of the election, were steps wisely taken. A lengthy review of the evidence concerning this meeting would not be profitable. It is sufficient to say that the finding of the trial court, to the effect that the meeting was legally called and fairly conducted, is amply supported by the record.\\nUnder its general powers as a court of equity in charge of the liquidation of the association and its receivership, the judge of the superior court before whom the matter was pending had ample authority to call a special meeting of the shareholders to consider questions upon which the shareholders could, with propriety, express their opinion. As to how far any opinion so expressed by a vote of the shareholders might bind the court, and how far be considered as advisory only, no question is here presented.\\nWe agree with the trial court that the record affords no basis for holding that changed conditions require that the supervisor approve the reopening of the association, and two-thirds majority in amount of the shareholders present and voting at a shareholders meeting has never approved such action.\\nThe record is long, and some other questions are argued. It is not, however, necessary to further extend this opinion. The findings of the trial court are amply supported by the record, and the court properly held that the record fails to show that appellants are entitled to the relief which they ask.\\nThe judgment appealed from is affirmed.\\nBlake, C.

The Superior Court for King County, Robert M. Jones, Judge, Respondent.\"], \"opinions\": [{\"text\": \"Beals, J.\\nFor some time prior to 1932, Joe and Anna Gerts were husband and wife. May 17, 1932, Mr. and Mrs. Gerts made an agreement for the division of their community property. September 1, 1933, in the superior court for King county, Anna Gerts sued Joe Gerts for divorce, setting forth in her complaint the agreement above referred to concerning the property of the parties, and asking that the property settlement made by the parties be confirmed. Mr. Gerts answered the complaint and filed a cross-complaint, praying that a divorce be granted to him, alleging that Mrs. Gerts had obtained the property settlement by fraud, and praying that the property settlement be set aside, and that he have general relief in the premises.\\nThe case came on regularly for trial during the month of April, 1934, the court deciding the issues in favor of the plaintiff and signing findings of fact and conclusions of law in her favor. The court signed an interlocutory order granting plaintiff a divorce, approving the property settlement, and awarding plaintiff her costs. The defendant made a motion for new trial, which was denied July 13, 1934. He thereupon served and filed a notice of appeal to this court from the interlocutory order, but later abandoned the appeal, failing to file any cost bond.\\nNovember 9, 1935, Mrs. Gerts executed a will, naming John Urkanas as executor thereof. July 11, 1938, Mrs. Gerts executed another will, in which no executor was named. No final decree of divorce was ever entered, and October 16, 1938, Anna Gerts died. The next day, on petition of John Urkanas, Mrs. Gerts\\u2019 will, dated November 9, 1935, was admitted to probate. Shortly thereafter, Mrs. Gerts\\u2019 will, bearing date July 11, 1938, was, by the superior court, held to be Mrs. Gerts\\u2019 last will and testament, and Anton Atkins was appointed administrator of the estate with the will annexed.\\nSeptember 26, 1939, Joe Gerts filed in the divorce action a motion for an order allowing him to continue the case on his cross-complaint as against Mrs. Gerts\\u2019 personal representative. Mr. Atkins, as administrator of the estate of Anna Gerts, appeared in the divorce case in opposition to this motion; and after argument on the motion, the court advised counsel of its intention to grant the motion and allow Mr. Gerts to continue the action on his cross-complaint against the Anna Gerts estate.\\nOctober 10, 1939, Anton Atkins, as administrator of the estate of Anna Gerts, deceased, applied to this court for a writ prohibiting the superior court from proceeding further in the divorce case, and particularly from allowing Joe Gerts to prosecute his cross-complaint against the administrator of the estate of Anna Gerts, deceased.\\nJohn Urkanas, claiming to be interested in the proceeding, asked this court for leave to intervene by filing a brief in support of Mr. Atkins\\u2019 application for a writ of prohibition, and, leave having been granted, filed herein his briefs and, through his counsel, participated in the argument. In response to the order to show cause issued on Mr. Atkins\\u2019 application for a writ of prohibition, the respondent judge of the superior court appeared herein by counsel and filed briefs in opposition to those filed by relator and John Urkanas.\\nRespondent challenges relator\\u2019s right to the writ of prohibition, contending, first, that the writ should not issue because the record does not show that the trial court is proceeding without or in excess of its jurisdiction; and second, that it does not appear that relator has not an adequate remedy by appeal.\\nWe shall first discuss the situation as presented by the arguments on the merits. It is our understanding that the facts, as above stated, are admitted by all parties to be true. Relator contends that, upon the death of Anna Gerts, the divorce action abated, and that no further proceedings may be taken therein unless to enter a formal order terminating the action. Counsel for respondent contends that, upon the death of Anna Gerts, the interlocutory order became utterly void; that the divorce action remained pending upon Mr. Gerts\\u2019 cross-complaint, in which he sought to attack the property settlement; that relator should be substituted for Mrs. Gerts as party plaintiff; and that Mr. Gerts may continue, as against the administrator, the action which he pleaded in his cross-complaint, in so far as he attacked the property settlement and sought to set the same aside upon the ground of fraud in its procurement practiced upon him by Mrs. Gerts.\\nAll parties admit that, because of the death of Anna Gerts, the interlocutory order, in so far as it concerned the divorce between the parties, became utterly void.\\nCounsel for respondent rely upon the case of Masterson v. Ogden, 78 Wash. 644, 139 Pac. 654, Ann. Cas. 1914D, 885, in which it appeared that Cora Masterson sued her husband, James Masterson, for divorce, asking for a share of the defendant\\u2019s property. Mr. Masterson was much older than his wife and had several children by a prior marriage. The plaintiff alleged that, several years after their marriage, her husband, for the purpose of depriving her of any possible interest in his property, transferred all thereof to two of his sons, they agreeing to pay him a stipulated sum per month during his lifetime. Mrs. Masterson made her stepchildren parties defendant to the action and asked that the transfer of her husband\\u2019s property to them be set aside. The trial court entered a decree of divorce, after finding that the property was transferred by Mr. Masterson to his sons for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff, and awarded a considerable sum of money to plaintiff, making the award a lien upon the property. After denial of a motion for new trial, Mr. Masterson appealed to this court.\\nAfter the appeal had been perfected, Mr. Masterson died, and his executor was substituted as a party defendant to the action. The executor moved for an order abating the action; the plaintiff contending that the appeal should be dismissed. The executor contended that, upon Mr. Masterson\\u2019s death, the entire action abated, and that the appeal had operated to set aside the judgment of divorce entered by the trial court. This court held that, on the appeal, no inquiry could be made as to whether or not the evidence was sufficient to justify the trial court in granting the divorce, and that the decree of divorce must stand. It was conceded by the plaintiff that the action survived as to the amount of the judgment and the rights of third persons, and the court proceeded to decide that question on the merits, affirming the judgment of the trial court. Mr. Masterson\\u2019s children were parties defendant to the action, and it would seem that the death of their father would not terminate the action as to them, their rights in property conveyed to them by their father being directly involved. The case was governed by the law as it stood prior to the enactment of the statute [Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 988] which provides for the entry of an interlocutory order in divorce cases, to be made final after the expiration of six months from its date. Under the old law, the parties were divorced by the decree, subject to appeal; under the statute now in force, the parties are not divorced until the final decree is entered.\\nIt has long been the law in this state that, in an action for divorce, the court may divide the property of the parties, whether community or separate, and in proper cases award judgment for alimony or support money. The subject matter of such an action, however, remains the marital status of the parties, the settlement of the property rights being merely incidental. Ambrose v. Moore, 46 Wash. 463, 90 Pac. 588, 11 L. R. A. (N. S.) 103; Wilkinson v. Wilkinson, 63 Wash. 126, 114 Pac. 915.\\nIn re Martin\\u2019s Estate, 127 Wash. 44, 219 Pac. 838, it appeared that Harry and Dora Martin intermarried during the year 1906. In 1920, they separated, dividing their real property by the exchange of deeds, each taking possession of a portion of the personal property, but without any contract covering the same. In 1921, Mr. Martin sued his wife for divorce. Mrs. Martin not appearing in the action, her default was entered, and an interlocutory order entered, granting the plaintiff a divorce and confirming the division of the property. Mr. Martin died after the entry of the interlocutory order, but before the entry of a final decree, leaving a will naming a third party executrix. Upon her application, Mrs. Martin was appointed administratrix of community property owned jointly by herself and her husband. Upon a hearing, the court decided that the property in dispute was the separate estate of the husband and confirmed his executrix in possession thereof. Mrs. Martin, as administratrix of the community estate, appealed. This court, in considering the effect of the interlocutory order, said:\\n\\u201cIt is our opinion that the entire order is interlocutory; that, if the interlocutory decree is subsequently made final, all of its provisions then become so; but if, by mutual agreement of the parties to the proceeding, by the death of one of the parties, or for any other cause, the divorce is not made final, the interlocutory decree in its entirety becomes a nullity. It is the general rule, and this court has held [see Ambrose v. Moore, 46 Wash. 463, 90 Pac. 588, 11 L. R. A. (N. S.) 103], construing our prior statute which did not provide for an interlocutory decree, that the power to dispose of the property of the husband and wife in a divorce proceeding was a mere incident of the power to grant a divorce, and we think the same rule prevails under the present statute. Being an incident, there can be no disposition of the property of married persons in a divorce action unless the action reaches the stage of an absolute decree.\\u201d\\nIn the recent case of McPherson v. McPherson, 200 Wash. 365, 93 P. (2d) 428, decided after the trial court heard the argument upon Mr. Gerts\\u2019 motion in the case at bar, it appeared that the plaintiff, Edith McPherson, sued her husband for divorce, on the ground of non-support. The defendant filed an answer and cross-complaint, praying that a divorce be granted to him. After a trial, the court made findings of fact and conclusions of law in plaintiff\\u2019s favor and entered an interlocutory order, granting plaintiff a divorce, settling the property rights of the parties, and awarding to the plaintiff the custody of a minor child. Mr. McPherson appealed. While the appeal was pending before this court, Edith McPherson died, and her executor, a trust company, moved that it be substituted as party respondent. Mr. McPherson, as appellant, after alleging the death of the respondent, moved that the action be abated and dismissed, upon the ground that, the action being one for divorce, and the plaintiff having died after the entry of the interlocutory order and pending the appeal, that order, upon Mrs. McPherson\\u2019s death, became a nullity. As stated in the opinion, the question to be determined was:\\n\\u201cDoes an interlocutory order of divorce, which makes an award of property, fail, abate, and become a nullity for all purposes upon the death of a party respondent, occurring subsequent to its entry and prior to the entry of a final decree, and while an appeal from such interlocutory decree is pending in this court?\\u201d\\nThe executor contended that, as between the parties, the interlocutory order was final and conclusive, subject to appellant\\u2019s right to review the fairness of the division of the property of the parties, and that, as to that question, the action did not abate upon Mrs. McPherson\\u2019s death. In determining the question, we reviewed our previous decisions, quoted extensively from several of them, and distinguished the case of Masterson v. Ogden, supra, which the executor relied upon as supporting its contention that the action did not abate.\\nWe held that the action abated upon Mrs. McPherson\\u2019s death, and that the interlocutory order, in its entirety, became a nullity as of that date; that there was nothing before the court to consider except a proper disposal of the appeal, for which purpose only Mrs. McPherson\\u2019s executor was substituted for her as party respondent. The appeal was accordingly dismissed.\\nCounsel for respondent seek to distinguish the McPherson case, upon the ground that there the property settlement contained in the interlocutory order was merely incident to the action for divorce, while in the present case, prior to the institution of that action, the parties had themselves agreed upon a division of their property, which contract Mr. Gerts attacked in his cross-complaint. In an action for divorce, the trial court is not bound by any property agreement which the parties may have made. All the property of the parties, whether separate or community, is before the court, and the same may be divided between the parties as the court deems just and equitable. In an action for divorce, a property settlement or agreement between the parties may be entirely disregarded by the court, and should be followed in dividing the property between the parties in the interlocutory order only when the court is satisfied that the agreement is fair and just and, in view of all the circumstances of the case, conforms to the views of the court as to a proper division of the property of the respective parties.\\nThe fact that Mr. Gerts had, in the divorce action, filed a cross-complaint attacking the property settlement, in law added nothing to the authority of the court, by the interlocutory order, to divide the property of the parties. It was a proper course for Mr. Gerts to follow in making up the issues to be tried, but it did not enlarge the scope of the evidence to be admitted nor the inherent power of the court to divide the property.\\nRespondent argues that relator has made no case for the issuance of a writ of prohibition, because it does not appear that the trial court is acting without or in excess of its jurisdiction, and because an adequate remedy by appeal exists. We hold that, in indicating that it will proceed to hear, in the divorce action, the issues raised by Mr. Gerts\\u2019 cross-complaint, the trial court is acting in excess of its jurisdiction, as that action has abated, the court having only jurisdiction to enter an order of dismissal. The death of Mrs. Gerts is admitted. The jurisdiction of the court does not depend upon any controverted fact which it must determine. State ex rel. Hopman v. Superior Court, 88 Wash. 612, 153 Pac. 315.\\nUnder the circumstances, we are also of the opinion that the remedy by appeal is not adequate.\\nThe writ will issue.\\nBlake, C.

The Department of Labor and Industries, Appellant.\"], \"opinions\": [{\"text\": \"Blake, C. J.\\nOn May 15, 1936, plaintiff, while engaged in extrahazardous employment, sustained injuries which resulted in his permanent total disability. He was classified by the department of labor and industries as permanently and totally disabled and placed upon the pension rolls as of March 15, 1937. After drawing his pension for several months, he persuaded the department to convert his reserve into a lump sum payment of $1,400 upon the pretext that he was leaving the state to take up his residence in Illinois. The settlement was ostensibly made under authority of Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 7679 [P. C. \\u00a7 3472] (j), which provides:\\n\\u201cIf a beneficiary shall reside or remove out of the state the department may, in its discretion, convert any monthly payments provided for such case into a lump sum payment (not in any case to exceed the value of the annuity then remaining, to be fixed and certified by the state insurance commissioner, but in no case to exceed the sum of four thousand dollars ($4,000.00).\\u201d\\nAt the time of settlement, the value of plaintiff\\u2019s annuity, according to the computation of the state insurance commissioner, was $6,288.75.\\nWithin a few months, plaintiff was back in the state demanding further compensation. The department, taking the position that the settlement was valid and final under Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 7679 (j), denied relief. Plaintiff appealed to the superior court, which held the settlement void. Judgment was entered in favor of plaintiff in accordance with the holding of this court in Booth v. Department of Labor & Industries, 189 Wash. 201, 64 P. (2d) 505. The department appeals.\\nIt is the contention of the department that, under Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 7679 (j), monthly payments due the pensioner may be converted into a lump sum payment in any amount less than four thousand dollars, even though the cash value of his annuity is more than four thousand dollars. We think, however, that, when read in the light of other provisions of Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 7679 [P. C. \\u00a7 3472], and in connection with Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 7681 [P. C. \\u00a7 3475], it is apparent that subd. (j) has no application to pensioners who are permanently and totally disabled. It is unnecessary to discuss here to what cases Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a77679 (j), may be applicable. It will suffice to observe that, under other provisions of Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 7679 (notably subd. (d) (4)), it is obvious cases may arise to which subd. (j) might be applicable. But, clearly, in the light of Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 7681, it is not applicable to cases of permanent total disability. The latter section provides:\\n\\u201cIn case of death or permanent total disability the monthly payment provided may be converted, in whole or in part, into a lump sum payment (not in any case to exceed four thousand dollars ($4,000.00), equal or proportionate as the case may be to the value of the annuity then remaining, to be fixed and certified by the state insurance commissioner, in which event the monthly payment shall cease in whole or in part accordingly or proportionately. . . . Within the rule aforesaid the amount and value of the lump sum payment may be agreed upon between the department and the beneficiary. ...\\u201d\\nIn our opinion, this section affords an exclusive formula for the conversion of monthly payments to a lump sum payment in cases of permanent total disability. The fact that a totally disabled pensioner may remove from the state cannot be held to remove him from the protection accorded him by that section. Under the express terms of the act, he cannot barter away his rights. Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 7685 [P. C. \\u00a7 3479], provides:\\n\\u201cNo . . . workman shall . . . waive the benefits of this act by any contract, agreement, rule or regulation, and any such contract, agreement, rule or regulation shall be pro tanto void.\\u201d\\nConstruing Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 7681, we have held that, in cases of death or permanent total disability, when the value of the annuity is in excess of four thousand dollars, an agreement to settle for an amount less than four thousand dollars is void. Booth v. Department of Labor & Industries, supra; Hagen v. Department of Labor & Industries, 193 Wash. 555, 76 P. (2d) 592; Horton v. Department of Labor & Industries, 199 Wash. 212, 90 P. (2d) 1009.\\nSince the value of respondent\\u2019s annuity was in excess of four thousand dollars, his agreement to settle for an amount less than that was void. He is entitled to the relief granted by the trial court.\\nJudgment affirmed.\\nJeffers, Beals, Steinert, and Geraghty, JJ., concur.\", \"type\": \"majority\", \"author\": \"Blake, C.

The City of Bremerton, Respondent.\"], \"opinions\": [{\"text\": \"Geraghty, J.\\nThis action was brought by the plaintiffs to recover for the death of their minor son, Lyle Aubrey Clark, alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the defendant, city of Bremerton. At the close of the plaintiffs\\u2019 case, the court granted the defendant\\u2019s motion for nonsuit and entered a judgment dismissing the action with prejudice. Plaintiffs appeal.\\nMay 19, 1938, the water department of the respondent city was engaged in excavating a trench along the side of one of its streets preliminary to the installation of a water main. The crew employed on the trench worked a six-hour day, or until two-thirty or three o\\u2019clock in the afternoon. It was the city\\u2019s practice to place lighted flare pots along the excavation at the close of the day\\u2019s work to warn users of the street of the danger incident to the open trench.\\nSometime between five-thirty and six o\\u2019clock, on the afternoon of the 19th, after the crew had ceased work and the lighted flare pots had been set, three of the appellants\\u2019 children, Lyle, the deceased, ten years and nine months of age, a younger sister, and Arley, a brother, fourteen, together with Loren Hooper, were playing in the trench at a point where it was about three and a half feet deep. Lyle reached out of the ditch and drew one of the lighted flare pots towards him so that he could melt some tar in the flame. Some of the kerosene escaped from the pot, ignited, and set fire to the boy\\u2019s clothing, causing the burns that resulted in his death. Arley Clark, the deceased\\u2019s older brother, describing the accident, testified as follows:\\n\\u201cQ. Just tell the jury what happened. A. Well, he went and tipped the smudge pot. ... He tipped the smudge pot over a little ways and then the oil went down on the side, and he did that once, and he was successful, and the second time the top blew off and he caught fire. Q. Why do you say the top blew off? A. Well, I imagine it was the top because it was a big Puff! and it just went right in his face. . . . Q. . . . Show the jury what your brother did. A. Well, he was about down like this and he tipped it over just a little ways and then he took hold of the chain and he had a rock here and he tipped it over like that, and then the oil ran out on the side and then it started blazing. Q. And then what happened again? A. Well, he did it the second time, and then . . . He used two rocks this time, and instead he tipped it like this, and it went and puffed in his face. . . . Q. Did it make any noise? A. No, it just went Puff! \\u2014like that, sort of. Q. Did you see where the fire caught him? A. Yes, it hit him in front, about here, all over on his head. . . . Q. Now, did he say anything to you before he tipped it over? A. Well, the first time he never said nothing. He was just tipping it over. And then the second time he says, \\u2018Look, Arley, look what I can do,\\u2019 and then he went and started to fix it and then he went and looked .to see if I was looking, and he tipped it.\\u201d\\nOn cross-examination, Arley testified:\\n\\u201cQ. And the ditch came up about where on Lyle? A. Right in about the neck. Q. And did he have a rock in both hands? A. He did the second time, but not the first. Q. Well, now, what did he do the first? A. Well, he took hold of it like this and had a rock here, and then he tipped it over twice. He pulled it over like this. Q. And how long did he leave it over? Did he leave it tipping over a while? A. Oh, about five seconds, I guess. Q. Long enough for quite a bit of liquid to run out of it? A. Oh, -not so very much. Just enough for it to run out on the side. Q. Did it run down to the ground? A. No, I couldn\\u2019t say that it did. Q. And then did it catch fire? A. Yes. Q. All that that had run out caught fire? A. Yes. The Court: The first time? A. Yes. Q. And was that the time when he said then, he said, \\u2018See what I can do\\u2019? A. Yes. Q. And then what did he do that time? A. Well, he took two rocks, one rock like this, and then one back there, and he tipped it that way.\\u201d\\nLater, the witness was interrogated by the court as follows:\\n\\u201cQ. Arley, just so the record will show:\\u2014I don\\u2019t know whether it does or not\\u2014your brother was down in the ditch, pulling the flare towards\\u2014twisting it,\\u2014 turning it, tipping it right toward him? A. Yes. Q. Is that correct? A. Yes. Q. And now after he caught fire, the flare went back in the position that it is now? A. Well, it never went in the same position, but it was almost in the same. Q. It was almost straight up? A. Yes, it was straight up, but it was not in the same place, I mean. Q. Well, it was straight up? A. Yes.\\u201d\\nLoren Hooper, about the same age as the deceased, testified:\\n\\u201cQ. . . . Tell these people here\\u2014that is the jury\\u2014 just tell how it happened and what you saw. . . . A. He was melting the tar and it was about eight inches away from the side of the ditch, and he pulled it half way over and then started to melt the tar and it came over the rest of the way and hit the side of the ditch and then it exploded. Q. Why do you say it exploded? A. Because when it hit the side of the ditch it went Puff! like that. Q. What do you mean, a flame or\\u2014it went out like that? Pff! A. No, it was a flame. Q. A flame. Where was Lyle with reference to it when that puff came out? A. He was right in front.\\u201d\\nNo watchman was maintained on the trench while the work was in progress, and the city admits knowledge of the fact that children were accustomed to play in the street.\\nWhile the report cards of the school attended by the deceased show that he did not hold a high rating in his studies, his father testified that he was of average intelligence for his age. He had been cautioned by his parents the day before the accident to keep away from the lighted flares.\\nThe appellants\\u2019 assignments of error raise the basic question whether the evidence produced by them was sufficient to make a prima facie case, requiring submission of the issues of negligence and contributory negligence to the jury.\\nThey first urge, with great earnestness, that the city is chargeable with negligence under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\\nBoth appellants and respondent cite an article in the Washington Law Review, Vol. XIII, p. 215, in which the decisions of this court and the courts of other jurisdictions bearing upon the doctrine are collated and reviewed. The author states two rules, deducible from the authorities, which we think applicable here. One rule is to the effect that,\\n\\u201cWhere the injury was the result of the way in which the instrumentality was used, then, if the plaintiff was the actor, control was in him, and res ipsa loquitur will obviously be inapplicable.\\u201d\\nThe other is that,\\n\\u201cOnce the actual cause of the injury is established beyond controversy, of course, whether by the plaintiff or by the defendant, no presumptions will be involved.\\u201d\\nWhether or not the respondent was negligent in maintaining the lighted flares, under the circumstances of the case, is a question we shall later discuss. But, clearly, the negligence of respondent cannot be predicated upon the rule of res ipsa loquitur.\\nThe immediate cause of the accident resulting in the child\\u2019s death is not left in any doubt by the appellants\\u2019 own witnesses. The quoted testimony shows that the accident was brought about by the child\\u2019s own intermeddling with the lighted flare pot. It was one of the nine flares of the same type burning' along the trench, placed there to give notice of danger. Even if it be assumed, as contended by the appellants, that the instrumentality had not been recently inspected, there is no inference from the evidence that the failure to inspect was the cause of the accident.\\nThe eye-witnesses referred to an explosion, a \\u201cpuff.\\u201d It is clear from their testimony that the explosion or \\u201cpuff\\u201d was from the ignition of the kerosene which had spilled out of the flare pot when it was tilted over by the deceased. The flare pot, offered in evidence by the appellants, is of a type in common use. The body of the pot is a dome-shaped container for kerosene, with a broad flat bottom about seven inches in diameter. It has an opening at the top, into which is inserted a ring loosely resting on a flange. The wick, drawn up through this ring, is protected from wind by a covering or cap, closed at the top, but with openings underneath through which the flame escapes. The cap is not screwed onto the pot by threads, but is kept in place by flanges which fit into a groove when turned slightly to the right or left. An iron chain, nine inches long, is fastened to the top of the cap for carrying the flare.\\nIt is apparent that the cap could come off with comparatively little manipulation, but, even so, the flame would continue to burn unless the pot was tilted to such an angle that the ring holding the wick would fall out. It was testified that, after the accident, the ring for holding the wick was found some fourteen inches away from the pot, which remained upright, and that the cap to which the chain was attached was found in the ditch.\\nAs we have seen, the court, in order to interpret for the record the testimony of Arley Clark, inquired of him if the fact was that his brother was down in the ditch, \\u201cpulling the flare towards\\u2014twisting it,\\u2014turning it, tipping it right toward him?\\u201d To which the witness gave an affirmative answer. This furnishes the obvious explanation for the loosening of the top and the displacement of the ring holding the wick.\\nBut whether the flare pot was accident-proof or not is apart from the issue. No harm could have come to the deceased if he had not himself intermeddled with it.\\nThis brings us to the second ground upon which the appellants predicate negligence, namely, that the burning flares were an attractive nuisance to children playing in the street.\\nIn Heva v. School Dist. No. 1, 110 Wash. 668, 188 Pac. 776, 9 A. L. R. 267, an action was brought against a school district to recover for damages sustained by a minor, twelve years of age, who had climbed to the roof of a school building by means of a fire ladder maintained on the building. In descending, he tripped and fell to a fire escape landing below, causing the injuries complained of. A jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. It was set aside by the court and a judgment for the defendant entered non obstante veredicto. Affirming the judgment, the court said:\\n\\u201cCommon objects, the uses and dangers of which are obvious and well known, at least to the normal child of twelve years, and which cannot be made inaccessible without destroying the purpose for which they exist, may not, under the law as established in this state, be found to be attractive nuisances simply because injury from their use has occurred to a licensee or trespasser of sufficient age and understanding to appreciate the danger.\\u201d\\nIt is a matter of common knowledge that open flares of the type used here are in general use on city streets, as well as country highways, to give warning of danger where work is in progress. The city was under a legal duty to warn against the open trench and, to that end, employed an instrumentality in common use. It may be that an open flare has some attraction for children; on the other hand, it brings home to them strongly the possibility of danger. The city was faced with a dilemma. The trench required the use of lights involving, it may be, some measure of danger. The almost certain risk of injury from an open, unguarded trench in a public street would be greater than the risk involved in the maintenance of the lights. The utility of the lights in guarding the ditch outweighed the danger of their use.\\nIn passing upon facts differing from those present here only in 'that the burned child was two years of age and lanterns were used rather than open flares, the supreme court of Minnesota, in Brown v. Minneapolis, 136 Minn. 177, 161 N. W. 503, said:\\n\\u201cDefendant was in duty bound to light these trenches with red lights at night. It set the lights in about the usual way. It cannot be said that it was negligence to set them when the men quit work instead of sending some one back at dark for that purpose. There were small children in this neighborhood, but in this respect it was no different from any other residence locality. The city could not be required to place or secure such lights so that children could not reach or disturb them. It is not easy to see how the city could do so and still have them serve their purpose.\\n\\u201cA lantern is some attraction to a child and involves some danger, but we cannot regard a common lantern as being of such attraction or such an inherent danger as to bring the case within the rule of the class of cases known as \\u2018turntable cases.\\u2019\\n\\u201cWe think there was no negligence on the part of defendant in placing this lantern upon the pile of sand at the end of the trench.\\u201d\\nSince respondent was not chargeable with primary negligence, it is unnecessary to discuss the question whether the deceased was sufficiently mature to be chargeable with contributory negligence.\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\nBlake, C.

Fisch, Appellant.\"], \"opinions\": [{\"text\": \"Steinert, J.\\nThis is a consolidated appeal involving three actions. The first was brought by Lou F. Fisch against Nannie B. Marler, formerly Nannie B. Fisch, to set aside a decree of divorce which she had obtained against him in a prior action, or, in the alternative, to procure injunctive or other equitable relief against the enforcement of the decree. Nannie B. Marler instituted the second action, or series of actions, by procuring successive writs of garnishment, supplemental to the.decree, directed to the employer of Lou F. Fisch; in those proceedings, an order of intervention was entered upon the complaint of Anna Fisch, the present wife of Lou F. Fisch. The third action was a contempt proceeding instituted by Nannie B. Marler against Lou F. Fisch, under the title of the original divorce action, and was brought contemporaneously with the second garnishment proceeding. These actions were in part consolidated for trial below and all of them were duly heard and disposed of by the same trial judge.\\nThe complaint of Lou F. Fisch in the first action was dismissed, and from the judgment therein, he has appealed. The writs of garnishment in the second series of actions were also dismissed, with an allowance of twenty-five dollars attorney\\u2019s fee to the garnishee employer, and the gamisher, Nannie B. Marler, was forever enjoined from attempting to take any of the community property of Lou F. Fisch and his present wife, Anna Fisch, and particularly from procuring any further writs of garnishment directed to the employer of Lou F. Fisch. From a judgment and decree embodying those rulings, Nannie B. Marler has appealed. In the contempt proceeding, findings of fact were made and an order was entered adjudging Lou F. Fisch in contempt and prescribing the terms of purgation. From that order, Lou F. Fisch has appealed.\\nIn order to have an accurate understanding of the questions here involved, it will be necessary to employ some detail of dates and circumstances making up the skein of the present controversy. For convenience, we shall refer to Lou F. Fisch as appellant, to Nannie B. Marler as respondent, and to Anna Fisch as intervener.\\nAppellant became acquainted with respondent at Kellogg, Idaho, on March 17, 1915, both parties being at the time residents of that state. Appellant was then a single man; respondent was the wife of one Bernie Blair, by whom she had one child, a daughter three years of age. Blair disappeared from Kellogg in May, 1915, and has not been heard from since. Respondent was divorced from Blair October 23, 1915, and was awarded the custody of the child. According to the stipulation of the parties herein, the law of Idaho at that time rendered a subsequent marriage illegal and void unless the former marriage of either party had been annulled or dissolved more than six months. Laws of Idaho, 1903, p. 10, \\u00a7 1.\\nThere is a dispute in the evidence as to when appellant first learned the date of respondent\\u2019s divorce from Blair. Appellant testified that when he met respondent in March, 1915, she told him that she was then divorced, and that he did not definitely learn otherwise until the commencement of his present action. Respondent, on the contrary, testified that appellant was well aware of her marital status at the time, and that, in fact, he had aided her financially in procuring her divorce. Upon that issue, the trial court found for respondent. A review of the evidence upon the question convinces us that appellant was, at the time, well aware of respondent\\u2019s marital situation. We therefore agree with the finding made by the trial court and proceed with our consideration of the case on that basis.\\nOn March 4, 1916, which was within the six months\\u2019 prohibitive period, appellant and respondent went to the state of Montana for the express and sole purpose of marrying each other. After the ceremony had been performed, they returned to Idaho, where they resided for the next three years. It is without question that both parties believed that they were legally married.\\nSubsequently, they moved to Washington, where they lived together continuously as husband and wife until October, 1931, during all of which time appellant supported respondent and her daughter. No child was born of their union.\\nOn October 15, 1931, respondent instituted in Pierce county, Washington, an action for divorce from appellant on the ground of cruelty. Appellant defaulted in the action. On November 19, 1931, after a hearing, the court made findings conforming to the allegations of the complaint, to the effect that the parties had intermarried in the state of Montana, that appellant was guilty of cruelty toward respondent, that the parties had no community property except their household furniture, and that appellant was earning a salary of $250 per month and commissions. The court on the same day entered an interlocutory decree of divorce, in which respondent was awarded the household furniture, permanent alimony in the sum of seventy-five dollars per month, and an attorney\\u2019s fee of one hundred dollars. The interlocutory decree contained no provision reserving to the court the power to modify it. Final decree of divorce was entered, at the instance of respondent, on March 17, 1936.\\nAppellant paid the accruing alimony according to the terms of the decree continuously until August, 1938,' at which time the total payments made by him amounted to $6,150. He then discontinued payments, for reasons which will presently appear.\\nOn March 20, 1936; following the final decree of divorce above mentioned, appellant married his second wife, the intervener herein, who at that time was a divorced woman and the mother of two children, the older of which was about eleven years of age. A child, now about two years old, was subsequently born of her marriage to appellant. Intervener and her three children are being supported by appellant, who also contributes from thirty to forty dollars per month toward the support of his aged parents.\\nOn March 19, 1938, respondent married Dallas Marler, a private in the United States Army, earning a compensation of $37.50 per month. No child has been born of that union. Appellant did not learn of respondent\\u2019s marriage to her third husband until September, 1938, at which time, on advice of counsel, he discontinued the monthly payments to her. Respondent testified that she could not have married her present husband had it not been for the fact that she was receiving seventy-five dollars per month alimony from appellant; that she had no other source of income; that for a long time she had been under a doctor\\u2019s care; and that she and her present husband were buying a home, upon which they were paying twenty dollars a month.\\nThe evidence discloses that appellant now earns three hundred dollars per month, plus a yearly bonus, which in 1938 amounted to $1,600. There is a mortgage on his present home, occupied by himself and intervener, amounting to about $3,900. Without going into further details upon the subject of appellant\\u2019s financial obligations, it is sufficient to say that his evidence was to the effect that, after paying the necessary expenses of his present household and the monthly contributions to his parents, his income was insufficient to pay the alimony installments.\\nWith this factual situation before us, we approach the several questions presented for decision.\\nAppellant\\u2019s contentions, in so far as his complaint for relief from the decree is concerned, relate to the past and present marital status of the principal parties. His first contention is that the marriage in Montana was wholly void; and that, therefore, there could be no legal divorce, nor any valid award of alimony to respondent. Appellant rests his argument upon the fact that his marriage to respondent was within the six months\\u2019 prohibitive provision of the law of Idaho, where respondent was divorced and where the parties hereto were then domiciled.\\nWhile the general rule is that the validity of a marriage is determined by the law of the place where the marriage is solemnized, there are certain well recognized exceptions. One of these arises when a statute either expressly or by judicial interpretation forbids remarriage by domiciliaries either within or without the state, for a certain period of time after their divorce. A remarriage during such time, wherever solemnized, is invalid. Restatement of Conflict of Laws, 195, \\u00a7 131.\\nThe applicable statute of Idaho, Laws of 1903, p. 10, referred to above, which is before the court by stipulation of the parties, declares that a subsequent marriage, contracted by any person during the life of a former husband or wife of such person, with a third party shall be illegal and void from the beginning, unless the former marriage of either party has been annulled or dissolved more than six months before. The statute, however, contains no provision making it applicable to marriages contracted outside the state; nor is there any case from Idaho before this court which determines the effect of the statute in that respect. The decisions of this state are, therefore, in so far as they are in point, controlling.\\nPrior to 1921, the law in this state (Laws of 1893, chapter 94, p. 225) prescribed a prohibitive six months\\u2019 period, during which persons divorced in this state could not, either within or without the state, lawfully marry a third party. We have a number of cases holding that marriages in contravention of that statute are void, regardless of the law of the place of celebration, and it is upon these cases that appellant relies. State v. Fenn, 47 Wash. 561, 92 Pac. 417, 17 L. R. A. (N. S.) 800; Pierce v. Pierce, 58 Wash. 622, 109 Pac. 45; Peerless Pacific Co. v. Burckhard, 90 Wash. 221, 155 Pac. 1037, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 247, L. R. A. 1917C, 353; Knoll v. Knoll, 104 Wash. 110, 176 Pac. 22, 11 A. L. R. 1391; In re Kienstra, 151 Wash. 424, 276 Pac. 294.\\nHowever, prior to 1893 the statute read differently. It required the court, in its judgment of divorce, to order a full and complete dissolution of marriage, and further prescribed that neither party should be capable of contracting marriage with a third party until the period of appeal (six months) had expired. Code of 1881, \\u00a72008.\\nConstruing that statute, this court held, in Willey v. Willey, 22 Wash. 115, 60 Pac. 145, 79 Am. St. 923, that the prohibitions of the code were not effective beyond the jurisdiction of the state, and that a common law marriage, contracted by one of the divorced parties during the prohibitive period, in another state which recognized common law marriages, was valid in this state, although the parties returned to this state before the expiration of the six months\\u2019 period.\\nIn so far as the extraterritorial effect of the Idaho statute is concerned, it, like \\u00a7 2008 of the Code of 1881, does not purport to affect marriages in other jurisdictions, and therefore the rule of the Willey case, which is in conformity with the general rule, Restatement of Conflict of Laws, 194, \\u00a7 130, Goodrich on Conflict of Laws (2d ed.), 305, \\u00a7 114, 2 Beale on Conflict of Laws, 685 and 686, compels the conclusion that the Idaho law did not invalidate the Montana marriage.\\nHowever, if the matter be viewed solely from the standpoint of appellant\\u2019s contention, he still cannot prevail.\\nAppellant alleged in his complaint that, at the time of his marriage to respondent, she had a living husband; but there was no proof of that fact. The evidence merely disclosed that respondent\\u2019s former husband, Bernie Blair, disappeared in May, 1915, and had not been heard from since.\\nThe presumption being in favor of the validity of a marriage, the person who attacks it, on the ground that one of the parties thereto had been previously married to another person, assumes the burden of proving that the former marriage had not been dissolved either by the death of the former spouse or by a decree of divorce. Goldwater v. Burnside, 22 Wash. 215, 60 Pac. 409; Potter v. Potter, 45 Wash. 401, 88 Pac. 625; Dono-frio v. Donofrio, 167 Wash. 80, 8 P. (2d) 966; 18 R. C. L. 427, \\u00a7 56; 38 C. J. 1328, \\u00a7 104; Tiffany on Domestic Relations (3d ed.), 62; 2 Schouler on Marriages & Divorce (6th ed.), 1486. Appellant therefore failed to prove a vital issue in the case.\\nAppellant\\u2019s second contention, based upon his complaint, is that, under the circumstances shown to exist, it is inequitable and unconscionable to permit respondent to continue to enforce her decree for alimony, and that he is therefore entitled to relief in equity.\\nIn making this contention, appellant does not ask that the decree itself be modified or altered. He could not well seek such relief, for this court has categorically held that, where the decree grants an absolute divorce and allows permanent alimony, though payable in installments, and there are no minor children to be cared for, and the decree contains no reservation of jurisdiction, and there is no statute conferring the power to modify after the time for appeal has expired, and the time limited by statute within which judgments may be modified has elapsed, and the judgment is not attacked upon the ground of fraud or mistake, the court has no power to modify or alter the decree to meet changed conditions. Ruge v. Ruge, 97 Wash. 51, 165 Pac. 1063, L. R. A. 1917F, 721; Cooper v. Cooper, 146 Wash. 612, 264 Pac. 1.\\nThe case of Blethen v. Blethen, 177 Wash. 431, 32 P. (2d) 543, affirmed the Ruge case and held, further, that a decree for alimony was property vesting in the person to whom the alimony was awarded; and that, since the legislature could not take away such vested rights in property, a statute was unconstitutional in so far as it attempted to confer power on a court to annul or vary final judgments for alimony entered before the passage of the statute.\\nThe cases just cited would be controlling upon any request for modification of the decree. Hence, appellant now resorts to equity, contending that the circumstances disclosed by the evidence are such as will warrant an equity court in granting the extraordinary remedy of enjoining further enforcement of the judgment.\\nIt is undoubtedly the rule that a party may obtain relief in equity against a judgment after the expiration of a year from the date of its entry, provided that proper grounds for equitable interposition are shown. Anderson v. Burgoyne, 60 Wash. 511, 111 Pac. 777; State ex rel. Northern Pac. R. Co. v. Superior Court, 101 Wash. 144, 172 Pac. 336. However, it is universally recognized that, where a party has failed to make a proper defense at law through his own negligence, equity will not aid him. Even though a judgment may be inequitable, it will not be set aside nor will its enforcement be enjoined, when it was the result of the complaining party\\u2019s own fault or inexcusable neglect. Spokane Co-operative Mining Co. v. Pearson, 28 Wash. 118, 68 Pac. 165; 3 Freeman on Judgments (5th ed.), 2500, \\u00a7 1204; 15 R. C. L. 740, \\u00a7 195; 34 C. J. 444, \\u00a7 698.\\nAppellant\\u2019s request is controlled by these principles. He was personally served with process, but failed to appear in the action in which the decree of which he now complains was entered. Had he appeared, he might have had the court specifically provide in the decree either that alimony should cease upon remarriage of respondent or that the court retained jurisdiction to modify the decree as changed conditions should warrant; and, if the court should have refused to do either, appellant could have appealed from the decree. On the contrary, appellant did not challenge the decree, but made payments thereunder until the commencement of this action, years later. We therefore hold that appellant is not entitled to relief upon his contention that the enforcement of the decree has now become inequitable and unconscionable.\\nAs another ground for relief from the effect of the decree, and particularly for the purpose of avoiding the judgment of contempt for failure to pay alimony, appellant contends that it is against public policy and good morals to compel a divorced husband to pay alimony to his former wife who has remarried and lives with her present husband.\\nThat question is one of first impression in this jurisdiction. However, it has been the subject of frequent consideration in other states. The cases are collated and discussed in 30 A. L. R. 81, 64 A. L. R. 1273, and 112 A. L. R. 253. Among still later cases are Durfee v. Durfee, 199 Atl. (R. I.) 747; Eaton v. Eaton, 3 Atl. (2d) (N. H.) 832; McHan v. McHan, 59 Idaho 496, 84 P. (2d) 984.\\nThe authorities are by no means all in harmony. Some of them take the view that, for reasons of public policy, a divorced woman should not, upon remarriage, be permitted to look to her former husband for support. Others hold that, since alimony is allowed on the theory that it is for the support and maintenance of a divorced wife, her remarriage to one capable of furnishing her suitable support may, under the particular circumstances, constitute a strong ground for terminating the alimony or reducing the amount decreed. Still other cases hold that remarriage has, and should have, no effect whatever upon the former allowance for support.\\nIt would be profitless to array and analyze the many cases on the subject. We have examined them carefully and compared the various reasons for their respective results. We believe that the weight of authority, the sounder reasoning, and the promotion of substantial justice support the conclusion of those cases which hold that remarriage of a divorced wife does not, of itself, terminate the obligation of the former husband to pay alimony as prescribed in the decree, but that ordinarily it would constitute a strong reason for the exercise of a judicial discretion, provided that it was supported by some recognized ground for equitable interposition.\\nWhether, under some particular set of facts and circumstances, it would be offensive to public policy or good morals to permit a divorced wife to receive alimony from her former husband, or whether a particular situation might be so glaring and offensive in nature as to call for a restraint upon the enforcement of a vested right, it is not necessary to decide here. The facts in this case as we have narrated them do not, in our opinion, present such a situation. We do not think that the enforcement of respondent\\u2019s vested rights, under the facts presented, can rightly be said to be offensive to public policy or shocking to a proper sense of good morals. Whatever force the particular circumstances might otherwise have had in calling for the exercise of judicial discretion, no ground for equitable interposition has been shown, because, as already stated, the result has come about through appellant\\u2019s own negligence in failing to take the proper steps to have the decree provide against the contingency which has now crystallized into an actual condition.\\nWe take up, next, the matter of the contempt proceeding. The trial court found that appellant had at all times been financially able to pay the amount of alimony decreed. A failure by a party to comply with the terms of a decree commanding the payment of alimony subjects such party to the penalty for contempt unless he shows his inability to perform the terms of the command. State ex rel. Smith v. Smith, 17 Wash. 430, 50 Pac. 52; State ex rel. Brown v. Brown, 31 Wash. 397, 72 Pac. 86, 62 L. R. A. 974; Croft v. Croft, 77 Wash. 620, 138 Pac. 6; Surry v. Surry, 78 Wash. 370, 139 Pac. 44; Phillips v. Phillips, 165 Wash. 616, 6 P. (2d) 61. We think that the order adjudging appellant in contempt was not only proper but was the only order that the court could have entered upon the facts found by it.\\nThe next controversy arises upon respondent\\u2019s appeal from the order (a) dismissing the two writs of garnishment, and (b) enjoining respondent from attempting to reach the earnings of appellant by future writs of the same nature.\\nAppellant concedes that a judgment for alimony payable in installments is, in so far as accrued installments are concerned, such a judgment as affords a legal basis for the issuance of a writ of garnishment. Boudwin v. Boudwin, 159 Wash. 262, 292 Pac. 1017. Knettle v. Knettle, 190 Wash. 395, 68 P. (2d) 218. His contention, however, is that his present earnings are the community property of himself and the intervener, and are therefore not subject to garnishment for the satisfaction of a separate judgment against him.\\nIt must be conceded that this presents a difficult problem; for, seemingly, we must adopt, as controlling of this case, one of two conflicting principles. One principle, well settled in this jurisdiction, is that community property may not be taken in satisfaction of a separate judgment or indebtedness of either spouse. The other principle, if we are to give it recognition, is that a divorced wife has such an interest in the earnings of her former husband as will support a garnishment for unpaid installments of alimony. Apparently, there has been some doubt among the members of the bar as to which of these principles governs the other in case of conflict.\\nIn State ex rel. Brown v. Brown, 31 Wash. 397, 72 Pac. 86, 62 L. R. A. 974, a divorced husband, who had subsequently remarried, was adjudged in contempt for failure to pay alimony for the support of his divorced wife and minor child. In affirming the judgment we said:\\n\\u201cWhile the appellant, under the law of this state, may after the decree of divorce legally remarry, the fact of a subsequent remarriage cannot relieve him of the obligation fixed by the decree. If his monthly income after divorce was sufficient to support himself alone and to pay his divorced wife the alimony allowed, he could not by his subsequent marriage set aside the decree, or be heard to say that the additional burdens which he himself thereby assumed made him unable to comply with the decree. The divorced wife and minor child have a fixed and prior claim upon the earnings of appellant, which appellant for his own comfort may not take away.\\u201d (Italics ours.)\\nIn Herrett v. Herrett, 80 Wash. 474, 141 Pac. 1158, the lower court modified an original divorce decree in several particulars. On motion of the divorced wife, the decree was modified by increasing the original amount of allowance of alimony. In reversing that portion of the order of modification, this court used the following language:\\n\\u201cIt may be said that the case falls within the rule of State ex rel. Brown v. Brown, 31 Wash. 397, 72 Pac. 86, 62 L. R. A. 974, and that a husband is bound to pay alimony to a former wife, notwithstanding the fact that he has remarried. We do not doubt this proposition, but this court has never intended to go so far as to hold that a divorced man or woman has no right to remarry, or that, if he does, all his earnings must go to the first wife. The Brown case does not deny the right of the court to measure the several obligations of the husband in a direct proceeding.\\n\\u201cThe law recognizes marriage as a civil contract founded on public policy, and encourages it in the interest of morality. If, then, a divorced husband remarries, he owes a duty to his present wife as well as to the former relation that the law must recognize if it is consistent. While the first wife may have first consideration and her necessities will not be unreasonably curtailed, or her wants ignored, neither will the necessities or wants of the second wife be disregarded. The court should and will make such adjustment as the relative necessities of the parties demand and the ability of the husband will warrant. From the record before us, the former order is more consistent with right and reason than is the one appealed from.\\u201d\\nIn Lockhart v. Lockhart, 145 Wash. 210, 259 Pac. 385, this court, in granting a divorced husband relief from a decree awarding alimony to the wife, expressed itself thus:\\n\\u201cIt is not the policy of the law, nor is it either just or equitable, that a divorced wife be given a perpetual lien upon her divorced husband\\u2019s future earnings. She has chosen to go her own way, to abandon all the obligations she assumed by her marital vows, and it is only under the most unusual circumstances that she can rightfully call upon him to continuously contribute to her support.\\u201d\\nIn both the Herrett case and the Lockhart case, the power to modify the decree had been reserved.\\nIn Haakenson v. Coldiron, 190 Wash. 627, 70 P. (2d) 294, a-divorced wife, seeking to recover alimony due her under a divorce decree, sued out a writ of garnishment directed to an insurance company. The company answered that it had in its possession certain moneys due the former husband under the provisions of the husband\\u2019s insurance policies. The husband filed a claim of exemption based upon a statute which made the proceeds or avails of accident and health insurance exempt from all liability for any debt of the assured. This court denied the claim for exemption, and stated that alimony and support money payments due are not a debt or liability within the meaning of any provisions of our constitution or any statute relating to exemption. In support of its conclusions, the court reasoned, by analogy, as follows:\\n\\u201cIf the funds in controversy are exempt, then the wages of the divorced husband, upon remarriage, would be exempt under our community property law. A divorced husband cannot, by remarriage, escape the obligation to pay alimony imposed upon him for the support of his divorced wife and minor child, even if the additional burdens imposed by his remarriage tend to exhaust his earnings, since his divorced wife and child have a prior claim upon his earnings until the modification of the decree in a direct proceeding therefor. State ex rel. Brown v. Brown [supra] . . .\\u201d\\nIt may be that the language which we have successively quoted from these four cases has engendered the uncertainty which now prevails concerning the right of a divorced wife to have the earnings of her former husband applied upon unpaid installments of alimony due her under a decree of divorce. The combination of factors in the case at bar is such, we think, as to require a definite statement from this court upon the subject.\\nConsidering the matter from its various angles and in the light of the preceding cases, we declare the following rules:\\n(1) The subsequent marriage of a divorced husband does not relieve him of his obligation to pay to his former wife permanent alimony as required by the decree of divorce, and the former wife has, and continues to have, a fixed and prior claim upon his earnings for the payment of such alimony. This rule finds particular support on grounds of justice and reason where there is a minor child or children of the former marriage.\\n(2) Garnishment is a proper proceeding to enforce such claims.\\n(3) The subsequent marriage of the divorced wife does not, of itself, terminate her fixed and pripr claim upon the earnings of her former husband, whether he remarries or not, nor does her subsequent marriage ipso^ facto terminate her right to enforce her claim by garnishment. This rule is likewise particularly applicable in cases where there is a minor child or children of the former marriage.\\n(4) Although the claim of the divorced wife upon the earnings of her former husband is a fixed and prior one, it is not in all cases to be enforced to the point of exhaustion of such earnings, for the present wife also has a claim thereon which is entitled to consideration. Upon a showing by the present wife of necessitous circumstances, particularly where there is a minor child or children of the husband\\u2019s subsequent marriage, the court may make such adjustment and allocation of the husband\\u2019s earnings as may appear to it to be just and equitable in the premises.\\n(5) For the purpose of securing or protecting such rights as she may have in the earnings of her husband, the present wife may intervene in any proceeding which affects such earnings.\\nFor the reasons hereinabove given, we hold that the writs of garnishment should not have been dismissed, and that the order enjoining respondent from seeking further garnishments should not have been made; but we also hold that the court had power to exercise its discretion in allocating the garnished funds according to the necessities of the parties concerned.\\nRespondent asks that indemnity damages be assessed, by this court, under Rem. Rev. Stat., \\u00a7 1058 [P. C. \\u00a7 7451], relating to loss or injury occasion\\u00e9d by contemptuous acts, or that the matter be remanded to the trial court for assessment; or else that the judgment on the appeal be without prejudice to further proceedings for damages. By such request, respondent seeks to recover an attorney\\u2019s fee for prosecuting the contempt proceedings.\\nIt is conceded by respondent that the question of such damages was never submitted to the trial court, and that she took no appeal from any of the provisions of the order adjudging appellant in contempt.\\nWe have repeatedly held that a question not raised in any manner before the trial court will not be considered on appeal. In re Corneliusen\\u2019s Estate, 182 Wash. 488, 47 P. (2d) 843, and cases therein cited. An added reason for not considering the matter is that respondent did not appeal from the order. Simmons v. Northern Pac. R. Co., 88 Wash. 384, 393, 153 Pac. 321, 155 Pac. 1039, Ann. Cas. 1918C, 1184.\\nSince the question of attorney\\u2019s fees could have been raised in the trial court, but was not, that issue is now res judicata. Globe Const. Co. v. Yost, 173 Wash. 528, 23 P. (2d) 895; Currier v. Perry, 181 Wash. 565, 44 P. (2d) 184; Baxter v. Central West Casualty Co., 186 Wash. 459, 58 P. (2d) 835; Large v. Shively (on rehearing), 194 Wash. 608, 79 P. (2d) 317, 82 P. (2d) 793.\\nThe judgment dismissing appellant\\u2019s complaint and the order adjudging appellant in contempt are both affirmed. The judgment dismissing the writs of garnishment is reversed, and that cause is remanded to the trial court with direction to proceed in accordance with the views herein expressed.\\nBlake, C.
