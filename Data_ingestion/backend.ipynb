Hardman Estate et al., Respondents.'], 'opinions': [{'text': \"Morris, J.\\nAppeal from an order of nonsuit and dismissal, in an action brought by a tenant to recover damages for injuries to her goods, caused by leakage of water from an upper story. The facts, so far as they are pertinent to our inquiry, are about these: The Hardman Estate is the owner of a building on Yesler Way, in Seattle, the lower portion of which is divided into storerooms, and the upper is used as a hotel. Appellant, who was engaged in the millinery business, occupied one of the storerooms under a written lease. Some time in August, 1911, the lessee of the hotel portion, although his lease had not expired, vacated the upper stories, and they continued vacant until after the damage complained of. This lessee not having paid his water rent, the city turned off the water from the hotel portion of the building some time in September. This water service so turned off, it appears, did not affect the storeroom occupied by appellant. There was, however, a dwelling on the rear of the lot which was supplied with the same service pipe as the hotel, and which had been vacated for some time. This vacant dwelling in the rear was rented on November 15, and orders given the city to turn on the water, which was done on November 16. Soon after the water was turned on, it began to o flow through the ceiling and into the room occupied by appellant, causing the damage complained of. An examination of the premises disclosed the fact that, in one of the rooms over the storeroom occupied by appellant, a washstand had been torn from the wall and the water pipes broken,' making quite a hole through which the water was escaping. It was also discovered that a large rear window opening on the alley had been broken, making an opening large enough for a person to enter the building. It was also shown that, on three other occasions during the vacancy of the hotel portion, the windows on the alley had been broken, supposedly by boys getting into the building. The lease contained the following clause:\\n“That the said lessee shall hold harmless the said lessor and the said lessor’s agents- from all damages of every kind or nature whatsoever that may occur by reason of any accident on said premises, -and from any damage done or occasioned by or from plumbing, gas, water, steam, or other pipes or sewerage ; or the bursting, leaking or running of any cistern, tank, wash-stand, or waste-pipe in, .above, upon or about said building or premises; and from any damage occasioned by water, snow, or ice being upon or coming through the roof, skylight, wall, trapdoor, or otherwise, and from damages arising from acts of neglect of co-tenants or other occupants of the same building, or of any owners or occupants of the adjacent or contiguous property.”\\nThis stipulation, in the judgment of the lower court, exempted the respondents from any responsibility in the matter, and was the basis of the ruling complained of. Stipulations of this character cannot be enlarged upon to include any damage not expressly waived, and it is generally held that such a stipulation will not excuse an injury occasioned by the negligence of the landlord in the management and use of any part of the premises remaining under his control. Levin v. Habicht, 45 Misc. 381, 90 N. Y. Supp. 349; 1 Thompson, Negligence, § 1143. It has also been held that such stipulations cover only ordinary wear and tear, or sudden action of the elements which could not be guarded against, or negligent acts of other tenants. Randolph v. Feist, 23 Misc. 650, 52 N. Y. Supp. 109; Worthington v. Parker, 11 Daly (N. Y.) 545.\\nIt is clear from the facts that the damage to appellant was not caused by any breaking of water pipes on the premises leased to her, nor was it due to any negligence of cotenants, nor of owners or occupants of adjacent property, but was due to the bursting or breaking of water pipes on premises not covered by the lease but within the building, and fall within that clause of the waiver exempting damage occasioned by bursting or leaking of washstands in, above, upon, or about the building, or by water coming through the walls. We think it is also clear that the cause of the damage was not an ordinary leak due to defective plumbing or usual wear, such as might be anticipated in any building and thus be within the contemplation of the parties when entering into a stipulation of this character, but was an unusual and unexpected happening, due to other than natural and anticipated defects or lack of repair in any fixture forming part of the water system of the building.\\nThere was no evidence that the proximate cause of this damage was any act of the landlord; and if appellant’s cause must rest upon some positive act of the landlord, it must fail. Negligence, however, may be predicated upon the failure to act where the law imposes a duty; and as between the appellant and the landlord, the occupancy and possession of the upper stories, with all the duties .flowing from such a relation, were with the landlord. The landlord could not excuse itself from this duty to appellant because of -the fact that, as between it and the lessee of the upper stories, the possession and occupancy was that of the latter. And this, we think, is so notwithstanding the tenant of the upper story had vacated within the term covered by the lease and the legal right of possession still remained in him. This might be and doubtless was true, as between the landlord and the upper tenant; and as between them, the upper tenant was still bound under his lease. But, whatever may have been the legal fiction, the facts were the upper tenant had vacated the premises and thus occasioned an actual, if not a legal, vacancy. Possession and control must rest somewhere, and as between the landlord and appellant, who was no party to the lease held by the upper tenant and not bound by any contract between this tenant and the landlord, this possession and control was, we think, with the landlord. It, therefore, seems to us, conceding the rule to be that the landlord is under no legal obligation to repair the demised premises, that it was the duty of the landlord to so control and preserve the upper stories as to keep them in a condition of reasonable safety, in so far as such a condition affected the tenant of the lower story; that, if it negligently suffered the upper story to be out of repair to such an extent as to damage the tenant of the lower story, it must respond in damages, and that the ordinary rule we have just referred to does not cover such condition as the facts here present. Priest v. Nichols, 116 Mass. 401.\\nSo far as we can gather from the facts, the injury was .caused by evilly disposed persons breaking into the building through the windows in the alley and outside of the premises covered by the lease to appellant. But the duty to guard the premises, so that such persons could not break into the building and injure the fixtures in the upper story, rested with the landlord and not with the appellant; and as it also appeared that these rear windows had been broken on three previous occasions, thus affording entrance to the upper stories, the landlord is chargeable with knowledge of the fact, and having knowledge it was its duty to guard against any recurrence and the natural consequences of such a trespass, by either protecting the premises from such a breaking, or investigating as to any harm that might have been occasioned thereby. The landlord also knew that the hotel section and the house in the rear were connected with the same water service pipe, and before the water was turned on, should have made an investigation of the upper floors to ascertain whether or not such an act could be done with safety to the premises occupied by appellant. Such failure to properly exercise superintendence over the upper story might, it seems to us, within the facts of this case, be’held negligence. Rosenfield v. Newman, 59 Minn. 156, 60 N. W. 1085. At least, we are not so clear it was not negligence as to say the question should not have been submitted to the jury. This disposes of the dismissal as to The Hardman Estate.\\nJohn Davis & Company was only the rental agent of the owner. Appellant, having dealt with a known owner and having sought to enforce her cause of action against the principal, cannot hold the agent, and. as to this respondent the dismissal is sustained.\\nThe judgment is affirmed as to John Davis & Company, and reversed as to The Hardman Estate.\\nCrow, C.

At the conclusion of the plaintiffs’ evidence, the trial court, sitting without a jury, sustained a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence interposed by the county and dismissed the case as to that defendant. The trial then proceeded with the city as sole defendant, and at the conclusion thereof the trial court rendered an oral decision in favor of the plaintiffs. The city’s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the oral decision having been denied, the court entered findings of fact and judgment for the plaintiffs against the city of Seattle, from which the latter has appealed.\\nRespondents were represented in the trial court and in the perfecting of their appeal by counsel other than those who appeared for them at the time of the argument in this court.\\nRespondents, husband and wife, are owners of a tract of land in King county, located a few blocks north of the city limits of Seattle at the northwest corner of North 102nd street and Aurora avenue. The property is bounded on the east by Aurora avenue, on the south by North 102nd street, and on the west by an alley which runs north and south parallel to Aurora avenue. About twenty feet north of respondents’ property, this alley is intersected by another alley running west to Linden avenue parallel to North 102nd street. Linden avenue, which runs northerly and southerly, is the next street to the west of Aurora avenue and intersects North 102nd street approximately one hundred yards west of respondents’ property. With the exception of Aurora avenue, which is a primary state..highway, all of these streets and alleys are unpaved county roads.\\nRespondents’ land is improved by a store building located on the southern portion of the property, fronting on Aurora avenue, on the rear or west end of which two separate additions have been built which are used for living quarters and garage and storage purposes. The original store building has a concrete foundation wall, but the two additions rest on concrete blocks. Respondents became tenants of this property in 1942, purchased it in 1944 for five thousand dollars, and began to use the additions as their home on May 9,1946.\\nIn order to understand the legal problems presented by this case, it is necessary to describe the topography of this area. North 102nd street is a graveled road which has been oiled and compacted. Immediately west of Aurora avenue, this street was graded by filling the traveled portion with gravel to an elevation somewhat higher than that of respondents’ property. For a distance of one hundred fifty feet west of Aurora avenue, the street surface is almost flat, having a very slight crown. The street then begins to rise in its westerly course so that, at its intersection with Linden avenue, its elevation is about twenty-five to thirty feet higher than its elevation adjacent to respondents’ property. West of Linden avenue, North 102nd street continues to rise for a considerable distance. The alley, abutting on respondents’ property on the west, slopes from north to south. The general slope of the ground and the natural drainage in this vicinity is from the northwest to the southeast in the direction of respondents’ property, which forms a sump or pothole.\\nThe greater quantity of surface water arising on the hill to the west of respondents’ property travels south on Linden avenue to North 102nd street and east down that street to Aurora avenue. Some surface water flows east down the alley between North 102nd and North 103rd streets, turns into the alley to the west of respondents’ property, and runs south toward North 102nd. Except for Aurora avenue, there are no curbs, gutters, or sewers in this area for the purpose of carrying off the surface water.\\nAccording to the testimony of respondent Sydney Stevens (who will be referred to as the respondent unless the context indicates otherwise), the surface wateri,had formed a small drainage ditch on the north side of North 102nd street to within one hundred feet of respondents’ property, where it then leveled out. Prior to January, 1948, according to his testimony, the surface water, with one exception, had always flowed past his property without entering thereon. The single exception was in 1945, when surface water settled in a puddle on North 102nd street near the front of the store building, but the water disappeared after the county deposited gravel in that spot. In respondents’ complaint, it was alleged that there had been repeated floodings of their premises since'May 9,1946, but at the trial respondent testified that this allegation was incorrect.\\nOn January 20, 1948, the appellant, under a franchise from King county, commenced to lay water mains on North 102nd street connecting with an existing water main on Aurora avenue and running westward. This work was done by a contractor (to whom appellant had awarded this job) with the knowledge and under the supervision of the county engineer.\\nA trench, approximately two feet wide and forty-four inches deep, was dug by appellant’s contractor ten feet north of, and parallel to, the center line of the street and twenty feet from the south edge of respondents’ property. The dirt was piled three or four feet high on the south side of the trench. The pipe was laid in eighteen-foot sections, and that portion of the trench was backfilled with earth and water on the same day. Two or three days later, the surface of the street was smoothed off with the blade of a “scoopmobile” (bulldozer with rubber tires). The surface dirt was removed by the contractor and dumped in a place remote from respondents’ property.\\nThe alley to the west of respondents’ property was not disturbed in any manner, since no lateral pipes were laid. The job was completed in five days on January 24, 1948. Respondent testified that, after the appellant finished its installation, a barrier of dirt about one foot high was left, which remained several days, but the street was leveled before the rain came in February, 1948.\\nThe evidence shows that the job was rather carefully inspected at every stage by both the appellant and King county to make certain that the street was left in the same condition that it was when the job was started. However, no measurements were taken to determine the precise level of the street either before or after the construction. Respondent testified that prior to the time appellant installed the water main the street was not in very good condition and had been neglected by the county. After flooding involved in this action, the county constructed a ditch on the north side of North 102nd street which has since conducted' surface water past respondents’ property to the sewer in Aurora avenue.\\nDuring the actual laying of the water main, very little rain fell, but between the 13th and 18th of February, 1948, two and thirty-five hundredths inches of rain fell in this area.\\nOn February 24, 1948, respondents filed their claim for damages with the appellant city of Seattle, as well as with the county. This claim not having been acted upon within sixty days from the filing thereof, this action was thereafter commenced. Paragraphs VII, VIII and IX of this claim stated as follows:\\n“VII\\n“On February 16, 1948, and prior and subsequent thereto, there was a substantial rainfall, and the surface waters and seepage flowing on said streets and alleys entered upon the claimants’ property in great volume.\\n“VIII\\n“As a result of the repeated flooding of claimants’ premises since May 9, 1946, the soil has been gradually washed away from under the foundation walls of claimants’ house and store building, causing the walls thereof to sag, causing distortions and displacements in the structure of said building. Many of the wooden timbers thereof which have been subjected to repeated water damage have become rotten, and a wooden stairway into the basement of the premises at 10207 Aurora has completely rotted out. The ground under the board walk leading from the sidewalk on North 102nd Street to claimants’ front door has been washed away, causing the walk to sink. The aforesaid flooding has also damaged claimants’ lawn and shrubbery.\\n“IX\\n“The aforesaid damage has been gradual and cumulative, increasing with the flooding of claimants’ property which has occurred after each rainfall.”\\nThe contention of respondents is that the damage complained of was caused by appellant’s changing the street contours while making a public improvement which resulted in the surface water flowing down the street being diverted onto their property. They maintain that the judgment can be supported either upon the constitutional provision against damaging private property for a public use (Art. I, § 16) or upon the theory of appellant’s negligence. The trial court in its oral decision indicated that respondents’ recovery in this action was based on the city’s negligence.\\nOn the other hand, appellant contends that there is absolutely no proof that surface water was collected by it and discharged upon respondents’ property in a concentrated form, and that there is no proof that the laying of the water main in North 102nd street resulted in any changing of the street contours so as to cause the flooding. Furthermore, it is argued that respondent did nothing to mitigate his damages, although he was aware of the flooding and could have protected his property at nominal expense.\\nAppellant assigns as error the making of finding off fact No. VII, the failure to sustain appellant’s challenge to the sufficiency of respondents’ evidence, and the entry of judgment against the city for the sum of five hundred dollars.\\nFinding No. VII reads as follows:\\n“At the time defendant City performed such work on North 102nd Street, there was no substantial rainfall. Approximately in the middle of February, 1948, there was a heavy rainfall, with the result that large amounts of surface waters collected on the high ground west of plaintiffs’ property, and by virtue of the crown of North 102nd Street were prevented from flowing in their natural southeasterly course, but were conducted by open ditches on Linden Avenue and North 102nd Street to the intersection of said streets and thence east down North 102nd to the flat area immediately adjacent to plaintiffs’ property. By reason of the fact that defendant City had altered the contours of said street, the said surface waters thence flowed upon plaintiffs’ property in large volume, causing the foundations of their said buildings to settle, with resulting damage as hereinafter described. But for the construction work done by the defendant City as aforesaid, the said waters would have continued to flow in said street until reaching Aurora Avenue, whence they would have been conducted away by adequate drainage facilities, all without damage to plaintiff, as had been formerly the case.”\\nWe have italicized the portion of this finding which is particularly to be .noted in connection with our discussion of the evidence in this case. Primarily, only questions of fact are here involved. North 102nd street, being outside of the city limits of Seattle, was entirely under the jurisdiction and control of King county. Therefore our decision in Kuhr v. Seattle, 15 Wn. (2d) 501, 131 P. (2d) 168 (cited by respondent), is not applicable.\\nRespondent calls our attention to the well-established rule that findings of the trial court made upon conflicting evidence will not be disturbed by this court unless we can say that such findings are clearly not supported by the weight of the evidence, citing Michigan Millers Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Oregon-Washington R. & N. Co., 32 Wn. (2d) 256, 201 P. (2d) 207.\\nFrom an examination of the entire record in this case, we are constrained to hold that the weight of the evidence does preponderate against the above-quoted finding. We will briefly state our reasons for so holding.\\n1. Respondent’s claim against the city and county as well as the complaint (both were admitted in evidence) alleged that there had been repeated floodings of the premises since May, 1946, and that the damage had been gradual and cumulative. At the trial, he testified that these statements were erroneous, but his own witness Meroney, a former neighbor, testified in his deposition that there had been repeated floodings since 1946.\\n2. This finding was made in spite of the trial court’s appraisal of respondent’s testimony as unsatisfactory. In its oral decision, the trial court commented upon respondent’s credibility as follows:\\n“But I must concede to counsel that the re-reading of this plaintiff’s testimony does not convince me that I would be permitted to found my conclusions upon his sometimes rather disturbing testimony. He was quite an opinionated man and at times was almost flippant, not only towards his own counsel, but towards the Court and everybody else; and it was difficult to get from him just exactly what the facts were. He was bound to argue his case, and that made his own counsel’s problem somewhat difficult, as it did the rest of us.\\n“But, apparently, he does not contend and does not claim to the Court that there was any dam left, a dam of loose earth left there at this point, ten feet north of the center of 102d Street at the time when the flood of -which he complains actually occurred.”\\nSince respondent’s testimony was not considered by the trial court as adequate to support its findings, there was no credible testimony as to the essential facts to support the judgment other than that contained in the deposition of Mr. Meroney (whom the trial court did not see or hear testify). The court characterized Mr. Meroney’s testimony as “not always clear and in some cases it is somewhat conflicting.” The latter’s testimony was outweighed by that produced by appellant.\\n3. In opposition to these two witnesses, five witnesses were called by appellant, to wit, the King county district foreman, an engineer employed by the county engineer’s office, the city’s contractor who performed the work, the engineer in charge of the work for the city, and the district engineer for the city. All of them testified that the surface of North 102nd street in the vicinity of respondent’s property was in substantially the same condition after the water main was laid as before this work was done. Thus, the weight of the evidence is to the effect that the city did not change the contours of the street.\\n4. In testifying in rebuttal, respondent admitted that the ridge of earth which he claimed appellant had left in the street after this work was completed was leveled off before the heavy rain came in February, 1948. Respondent’s only remaining cause of the flooding was that the city had changed the contours of the street. This is discussed in the preceding paragraph.\\n5. The preponderance of the evidence does not support the above-quoted finding because respondent did not sustain the burden of proving that the laying of the water main by the city was the proximate cause of the flooding. Disregarding for the moment respondent’s allegations that there had been repeated flooding since 1946, his evidence merely showed that the flooding here involved occurred during the first heavy rain subsequent to the completion of the work, whereas no flooding took place just prior to doing the work at a time when there was also considerable rainfall.\\nRespondent in his brief argues that the photographs taken by him, at the time the flooding occurred, show conclusively that most of the water which damaged his premises came from North 102nd street and not from the alley which forms the westerly boundary of his property. Four of these pictures have been enlarged, and we have given all of them careful consideration. The trial court’s comment regarding these pictures in its oral decision was as follows:\\n“But this water, he [respondent] claims, came, in part, down the alley to the west of his property, and partly from the west. I think he suggested he thinks about five times the quantity from the west and probably one quarter from a point to the west, meeting up with one coming from this property.\\n“Col. Nelson [appellant’s witness] seemed to think that more water had come down the west alley, east-and-west alley. I mean to a point west of the premises, and the area around east and west, probably than any other direction. But I do not think so, and I won’t stop to refer to it. I think one of the pho'tographs taken so indicates. You can almost see the heavy burden of water that came down’ along the north side of 102d Street.. The water in there, those pictures show the presence of water there, and convince me further of the actual presence of an unusual quantity of water; and that is confirmed as well by the testimony of both the plaintiff and his neighbor across the way. The neighbor’s testimony is not always clear and in some cases it is somewhat conflicting.\\n“But the conclusive and elemental fact is that there was an excess of water which was not in accordance with the prior experience of the neighborhood within recent years, or at least that is the testimony. And he is also confronted with the fact that it should fall in exact coincidence with the preliminary construction of the water-pipe line and a rather heavy fall of rain, which followed in the succeeding month.”\\nWhile the direction of the flow of the water is not as clearly discernible from the pictures as might be desired, nevertheless, if we assume respondent’s conclusion that the water nearly all flowed onto respondent’s property from North 102nd street to be correct, there would still not be sufficient evidence to support finding No. VII as to the cause of the flooding. The burden was upon respondent to prove that the city changed the contours of North 102nd street and that this change caused the flooding. The most favorable view of the evidence from respondent’s standpoint amounts to no more than a mere possibility that the flooding might have been caused in this manner. This is insufficient to support the trial court’s finding.\\nIn Home Ins. Co. v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 18 Wn. (2d) 798, 140 P. (2d) 507, we had occasion to consider a rule of law which is applicable to the present case. We there said:\\n“The rule is well established that the existence of a fact or facts cannot rest in guess, speculation, or conjecture. It is also the rule that the one having the affirmative of an issue does not have to make proof to an absolute certainty. It is sufficient if his evidence affords room for men of reasonable minds to conclude that there is a greater probability that the thing in question, such as the occurrence of a fire, happened in such a way as to fix liability upon the person charged therewith than it is that it happened in a way for which a person charged would not be liable. In applying the circumstantial evidence submitted to prove a fact, the trier of fact must recognize the distinction between that which is mere conjecture and what is a reasonable inference.”\\nMore recently, in Gardner v. Seymour, 27 Wn. (2d) 802, 180 P. (2d) 564, the same principle was stated briefly as follows:\\n“We have frequently said that, if there is nothing more tangible to proceed upon than two or more conjectural theories under one or more of which a defendant would be liable and under one or more of which a plaintiff would not be entitled to recover, a jury will not be permitted to conjecture how the accident occurred.”\\nThis rule is equally applicable whether the trier of fact be a jury or a court sitting without a jury.\\nSince w¿ find from the record that there is not sufficient evidence to sustain the trial court’s finding that the city changed the contour of North 102nd street in such a manner as to be the proximate cause of the flooding, the respondents are not entitled to any recovery as against the appellant upon either the theory of negligence or upon the theory of the city’s damaging of their property for a public use. To recover upon the latter theory, there must be a showing that the acts of appellant resulted in the damaging of respondents’ property for such purpose. The evidence applicable to this theory is insufficient to bring this case within the scope of our decision in Whiteside v. Benton County, 114 Wash. 463, 195 Pac. 519, and other similar cases cited by respondent.\\nThe judgment is reversed, with directions to dismiss the action.\\nSchwellenbach, Hill, Grady, and Hamley, JJ., concur.\", 'type': 'majority', 'author': 'Donworth, J.'}], 'attorneys': ['A.

Art Strand Floor Coverings, Inc., Appellant.'], 'opinions': [{'text': 'Rosellini, J.\\nThe respondent, Florence Frisken, is the owner of a building in Shelton, Washington, occupied by her tenant, Mell Chevrolet Company. On November 20, 1952, she entered into an agreement with the appellant, a corporation engaged in the business of selling and laying floor coverings, whereby the latter contracted to furnish and install grease-proof asphalt-tile flooring in the showroom and office of the respondent’s building.\\nPrior to the submission of the appellant’s bid, its president, Arthur E. Strand, examined the floors of the showroom and office, which were of concrete covered with magnesite, and recommended a tile which would meet the respondent’s needs. The appellant’s bid was accepted, and by December 3, 1952, the installation was completed.\\nWithin a week or ten days after the flooring was laid, it was observed that a dark sticky substance was oozing up between the tiles. On the strength of the appellant’s assurance that the condition was temporary and would disappear in a few weeks, the respondent paid for the flooring.\\nWhen the oozing or sloughing continued after six weeks had elapsed, complaint was made again, but it appears that nothing was done to correct the condition. Eventually the magnesite beneath the tile grew spongy and caused the floor to rise in spots, resulting in an uneven surface and cracks in the tile. Agents of the appellant inspected the floor and reported that the magnesite was crumbling and falling apart. Still nothing was done to repair or remedy the condition, and after it had continued for more than a year, this action was commenced to recover upon an alleged breach of an implied warranty of fitness.\\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a judgment in favor of the respondent.\\nWhile the appellant admits that the flooring is not satisfactory for the purpose for which it was intended, it contends that (1) the defects were caused by factors beyond its control, and that the implied warranty of fitness does not cover such defects, or (2) if there was a breach of warranty, the defect was waived when the respondent paid for the installation.\\nThe defense of waiver was not pleaded, and the appellant did not request a finding that the respondent had waived the defect. As we have often said, this court will not consider a theory which was not passed upon by the trial court and is presented for the first time on appeal. Muck v. Snohomish County Public Utility Dist., 41 Wn. (2d) 81, 247 P. (2d) 233 (1952); Smith v. King County, 28 Wn. (2d) 917, 184P. (2d) 562 (1947).\\nThe facts as found by the trial court do not establish a waiver, since payment was made after the appellant had given its assurance that the sloughing would disappear, a fact which negatives any implication of an intent to waive the defect. Furthermore, the full extent of the damage did not appear until several months after payment was made. The fact that the respondent had paid for the flooring would not deprive her of her right to recover for a breach of which she neither knew nor had reason to know at the time. See Eliason v. Walker, 42 Wn. (2d) 473, 256 P. (2d) 298 (1953), a case in which the plaintiffs, purchasers of a heating system, elected to rescind the contract after the equipment had been paid for and had been in operation for three months. We held that the delay did not constitute a waiver of their right to rescind for breach of warranty, since the inadequacy of the heating system was not established until it had been in operation for some time.\\nWe turn now to the appellant’s contention that the trial court erred in finding a breach of warranty. According to the findings, the respondent advised the appellant that an attractive floor was needed because the room was to be used for display purposes; she relied upon the skill and judgment of the appellant’s agent, who represented to her that the appellant could and would install a floor which would satisfy her needs. The floor, the trial court found, was entirely unsatisfactory. It concluded that there had been a breach of the implied warranty of fitness imposed under Rem. Rev. Stat., § 5836-15 [cf. RCW 63.04.160], which provides in part as follows:\\n“ (1) Where the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required, and it appears that the buyer relies on the seller’s skill or judgment (whether he be the grower or manufacturer or not), there is an implied warranty that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose.”\\nThe appellant argues that there was no competent evidence that the unsatisfactory condition was caused by faulty installation, and it is the custom of contractors not to warrant that magnesite flooring will not deteriorate and damage tile which is laid over it; therefore, there could be no implied warranty of fitness. In regard to the latter contention, there was scant evidence of such a general custom; the trial court made no finding that a custom existed, and none was requested. This facet of the argument is consequently without merit.\\nThe respondent’s expert witness, to whose qualifications the appellant made no objection, testified that the sloughing and unevenness was caused by moisture coming up through the magnesite, and that the “sweating” could have been avoided by the use of a sealer. The appellant’s expert witnesses testified that there is no sealer which can prevent this sweating, and that it occurs where no barrier has been erected beneath the magnesite or concrete; that there is nothing which can be done to prevent the occurrence once the magnesite and concrete have been improperly laid. The record contains no finding on this precise point, and apparently the trial court did not consider it controlling. Assuming that the fact was established, this in itself does not relieve the appellant of liability.\\nWhile the appellant’s president testified that he did not and could not have anticipated the condition which developed, he stated that the magnesite was tested for moisture before the tile was laid. The inescapable inference is that he knew of the possibility that moisture would rise through the magnesite and damage the tile. Furthermore, another of appellant’s witnesses, also a flooring contractor, testified that, unless a water barrier is installed, magnesite has a tendency to sweat and cause discoloration of the tile, and that it is customary to warn the purchaser of this possibility. In this instance, no inquiry was made to ascertain whether a water barrier had been installed, and the respondent was not advised of the risk involved.\\nNo error is assigned to the court’s finding that the appellant was familiar with climatic conditions in the area and knew the location of the floor with reference to the ground level as well as the nature and composition of the subflooring. Knowing or being charged with knowledge that there was a risk involved, of which respondent was obviously ignorant, and having failed to warn her of this risk before she made her investment, the appellant must be held to have warranted that the floor would be fit for the intended use regardless of the structure of the underflooring. It is the respondent’s ignorance of the nature and characteristics of floorings which establishes her reliance on the appellant’s skill and judgment. Had the deterioration of the tile resulted from some latent defect in the underflooring which the appellant could not have anticipated, or which the respondent as well as the appellant might have anticipated, a different question would be presented.\\nThe view we take is in accord with our holding in Columbia Concrete Pipe Co. v. Knowles, 36 Wn. (2d) 602, 219 P. (2d) 557 (1950). The defendant in that case, a farmer in eastern Washington, had contracted with the plaintiff for the purchase and installation of a pipe line which would irrigate certain designated portions of his farm. It was agreed that the defendant would dig the ditch for the pipe line, which he proceeded to do. The plaintiff’s agents, knowing that the ditch was probably too shallow, nevertheless laid the pipe, which soon sprang a number of leaks and proved to be unsatisfactory. Had the pipe been laid at the proper depth, it appeared that the leaks would not have occurred. We held that subdivision (1) of Rem. Rev. Stat., § 5836-15, was applicable, and that the defendant, having made known to the plaintiff the purpose for which the pipe line was to be used and having relied upon the plaintiff’s skill and judgment, was entitled to recover on his cross-complaint for a breach of an implied warranty of fitness.\\nAs we said in Lundquist v. Coca Cola Bottling, Inc., 42 Wn. (2d) 170, 254 P. (2d) 488 (1953), it is not necessary to prove negligence in order to recover for a breach of an implied warranty. The plaintiff must allege and prove: first, that he made known to the seller, either expressly or by implication, the particular purpose for which the article was required, and second, that it appeared that he relied upon the seller’s skill and judgment when he purchased the article. Under the rule of Columbia Concrete Pipe Co. v. Knowles, supra, if the seller undertakes to install the purchased item, he impliedly warrants that, after installation, it will be fit for the use intended. Of course, the seller may disclaim such a warranty, or the circumstances may negative reliance; but there is no evidence of a disclaimer here, and there is no question but that the respondent relied upon the appellant’s superior skill and judgment, and that the appellant was made aware of this fact.\\nAs we have construed the statute, the facts of this case fall within its provisions.\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\nHamley, C.

The City of Spokane, Appellant.'], 'opinions': [{'text': \"Millard, J.\\nThis action was brought to recover for damages alleged to have been sustained as a result of the depositing of sewage and water into plaintiff’s basement from a public sewer. The cause was tried to the court, which found that, pursuant to ordinance and regulations of defendant, plaintiff connected his property to appellant’s sewer; that the sewer installation required and approved by defendant was improper; that the sewer was of insufficient capacity to carry off the sewage and water conducted into it; and that, as the proximate result of defendant’s negligence, plaintiff sustained damage in the amount of two hundred and ten dollars, including the expense of fifty-five dollars incurred in the construction of a manhole subsequent to the flooding of the basement. Judgment was entered accordingly. Defendant appealed.\\nIt is the position of appellant that an extraordinary storm condition deposited an unusual amount of water in the vicinity of respondent’s property, thereby overtaxing the sewer system, which was reasonably adequate to care for sewage and water reasonably expected to accumulate under ordinary circumstances; and that the contributory negligence of respondent in failing to properly install a back water trap, or check valve, was the proximate cause of the damage and precludes a recovery by respondent.\\nThe facts are as follows:\\nRespondent owns a building, which was constructed in 1936, located at the northeast corner of Ninth avenue and Perry street, in the city of Spokane. In 1908, appellant installed the Perry street sewer, which is twenty inches in diameter from Seventh avenue to Ninth avenue. A sewer under Ninth avenue empties into the Perry street sewer, the diameter of which at this point is twenty-four inches.\\nIt is the duty, under an ordinance of the city of Spokane, of appellant’s health officer, where there is a public sewer in any street, to compel every owner within one hundred and fifty feet of the sewer to install a sufficient drain pipe, which shall connect his property to the nearest sewer. The health officer is also authorized to issue a permit for a cesspool or septic tank on premises in a sewer district, to drain plumbing fixtures or floors too low to be drained into the public sewer; but all other fixtures or floors on the premises are required to be drained through the sewer. The basement of respondent’s property was too low to properly drain to the sewer.\\nRespondent called in July, 1936, at the office of appellant’s sewer inspector and superintendent and requested permission to install a cesspool on his premises at Ninth avenue and Perry street. After inspection of respondent’s property, one of the officers of appellant’s sewer department informed the respondent that he would be required to connect with the Perry street sewer and that he would not be permitted to install a cesspool; that is, the city sewer superintendent and the city sewer inspector knew that respondent’s basement was too low to properly drain to the sewer, yet they required him to make the sewer connection, which they later inspected and approved.\\nThe basement drains and fixtures of respondent’s property were, pursuant to the foregoing instructions, connected in July, 1936, to the sewer in Perry street. Neither the superintendent of sewers nor the inspector, who required respondent to use iron pipe instead of clay pipe he contemplated installing, informed respondent that a back water trap was necessary or would be required; nor does the city ordinance require the installation of a back water trap. The sewer connection was installed by a man who had constructed sewers for more than twenty-five years. Doubtless, the installation of the connection was in the usual, customary, and workmanlike manner, as it was approved in all respects by appellant’s sewer inspector.\\nSince the construction of the Perry street sewer in 1908, the city’s population has greatly increased and many additional house connections — eight hundred and ninety-one in 1933 — have been made to the sewer. Many of the streets sloping toward Perry street have been paved within the past few years, so that the surface waters feed into the catch basins, and the remainder of the surface water that does not run into the catch basins accumulates at the comer of Ninth avenue and Perry street, in front of respondent’s property, where the street levels off and a pocket is formed at that intersection. Whenever it rains and the sewer becomes overloaded in that intersection, and often when it accumulates in the street, respondent’s basement receives some of the water.\\nDuring the heavy rains in the early part of June,' 1937, respondent complained to one of appellant’s commissioners concerning the flowing of water — not in great quantities — into his basement. The commissioner suggested to respondent that he install a “back water trap.” Respondent employed a plumber to install such a trap or check valve inside the basement. Whether the plumber did or did not advise respondent that the trap should be installed outside of the building, is not material. The plumber did advise respondent that a back water trap installed in the basement would protect the plumbing therein. There is some evidence that a back water trap installed outside the basement would not wholly prevent the backing up of sewage and water. It is clear, however, that respondent had no further serious difficulty subsequent to installation of a trap following the damage of which he now complains.\\nOn June 18, 1937, during a severe rain storm, respondent’s basement was flooded by reason of the backing up of the water and sewage from the Perry street sewer. Great damage was inflicted to property three miles from respondent’s property, it was testified, by the heavy rains. While there is evidence that the rainfall for the entire month of June was Very heavy, there is evidence from which it is reasonably inferable that the total rainfall for the month of June would not have overtaxed the sewer if it had functioned properly.\\nDuring the twenty-four hour period of June 18, 1937, forty-seven hundredths of an inch of rain fell. The weather bureau records disclosed that this rainfall was not unusual or excessive; that it had been exceeded many times during other twenty-four hour periods. On June 17, 1937, the day before the rainfall which it is claimed caused the flooding of respondent’s basement, five hundredths of an inch of rain fell. The testimony of one of the weather bureau officials was that, so far as the rainfall on June 18th and 19th, 1937, was concerned, “we have had rainfall that was greater than that on numerous occasions in the city of Spokane.” On cross-examination, he testified that the rainfall on those two days was unusually heavy; “. . . it was unusual as compared to the normal.”\\nThat is, the rainfall was such as had occasionally occurred in the past and which the city should reasonably have expected to occur again. Under such circumstances, if the sewers are so inadequate that they can not take care of the water, the municipality is not relieved from responsibility because the rainfall was extraordinary.\\n“Whatever the rule may be as to ordinary surface water or rainfalls, it is settled that a municipal corporation is not liable for damages caused by an overflow of its sewers occasioned by extraordinary rains or floods. However, although the rain doing the damage be of an extraordinary character, yet if the negligence of the city in failing to keep the sewers open concurred and contributed to the damage, then the city has been held liable. And if drains are so inadequate that they cannot take care of the water in case of an ordinary storm, the municipality is not relieved from responsibility because the rainfall was extraordinary.” 6 McQuillin Mun. Corp., Revised (2d ed.), 1226, § 2868.\\n“In order to give a stream or body of water the character of an extraordinary flow it is not necessary that it should be the greatest flow within memory, but its character in this respect is to be tested by comparison with the usual volume of floods ordinarily occurring. The mere fact, however, that a rainfall was unusual for the particular season in which it occurs does not relieve the municipality from liability. A municipality, as a general rule, is required to guard against such floods or heavy rains as have occasionally occurred, and which may reasonably be expected to occur again, although their occurrence may be at irregular and wide intervals of time.” 43 C. J. 1137, § 1895.\\nThe respondent was compelled by ordinance to connect his property to the sewer. The sewer connection was made in the manner approved by the appellant city. While the overflow of the sewer was caused by unusual rainfall, the rainfall was such as had occasionally occurred in the past and which the appellant should reasonably have expected to occur again. The appellant failed in its duty to guard against such heavy rainfall as that which overtaxed the Perry street sewer, which, though' adequate when constructed, had become of insufficient capacity in 1937 to carry off the water.\\nThe case at bar is controlled by Boyer v. Tacoma, 156 Wash. 280, 286 Pac. 659, 70 A. L. R. 1342, in which we held that a city is hable for the flooding of property required to be connected with a sewer which, though sufficient when constructed, had become of insufficient capacity to carry off the sewage conducted into it. We there said:\\n“It is true that in other cases from this court statements have been made by way of argument which indicate that the contrary rule might be followed. See Vittucci Importing Co. v. Seattle, 72 Wash. 192, 130 Pac. 109. But the statements therein contained are not necessary to a decision of the case. The theory of all of the cases which we have examined, which hold the city liable under circumstances such as we have outlined above, seems to be that the property owner is required to connect with the sewer; that he is not permitted to dispose of his sewage in any other way than the one way provided by the city; that he has no power or authority to remove the cause, or to in any way remedy the defect from which his injury arises; that the city alone has the power and the means to remedy the defective sewer or to replace an inadequate sewer, and that no person should be required to suffer an injury caused by an agency over which he has no control and over which the city has absolute control, and that if an injury is inflicted by such an agency he should be properly compensated therefor. We think this is the better rule and is well supported by both reason and authority.”\\nWoolworth Co. v. Seattle, 104 Wash. 629, 177 Pac. 664, is cited by appellant in support of its theory that there can be no recovery for damages from flooding where the loss was due to the concurrent negligence of the city in the maintenance of sewers of insufficient capacity to carry off an average rainfall and the contributory negligence of the owner in failing to keep clean and in proper repair a back water valve required by ordinance in all cellar and basement drains.\\nIn the case cited, a city ordinance required the installation of back water valves; while, in the case at bar, there was an absence of such requirement. There is no ordinance, nor is there any regulation of any department, of appellant which required the respondent to install a back water trap to protect his basement. The sewer connection was approved by appellant in all respects. The back water trap was voluntarily installed by respondent inside of his building to protect the plumbing in the basement upon the suggestion of one of appellant’s commissioners when respondent complained of water coming into his basement. In spite of that precaution, he sustained damages; and even if he had installed a back water trap outside of his building, it is not improbable, under the circumstances, that he would have sustained damages.\\nError is next assigned on the allowance of the cost of fifty-five dollars for the installation of a back water trap. If appellant had required respondent to install, as it now insists he should have done, the back water trap at the time of the connection of his property to the sewer, that installation would have entailed very little expense. As appellant did not require that installation, which appellant insists would have prevented the damáge, respondent should not be compelled to pay that which he would not have been required to expend if it had not been for appellant’s failure to perform its duty in the first place. Respondent acted in good faith and endeavored to comply with all the requirements exacted by appellant. The court correctly awarded to him the amount he expended in the installation of the back water trap.\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\nSteinert, C.

The City of Seattle, Respondent.'], 'opinions': [{'text': 'Mitchell, J.\\nAppellant, plaintiff below, was engaged in the mercantile business in the Arcade Building, in Seattle. In addition to its salesroom, it occupied the basement underneath for the storage, receiving, checking and shipping of its merchandise. It was a tenant of the premises, the basement of which abuts upon University street. The city maintained a sewer in University street. Radiating from this sewer there was a lateral sewer from and accommodating the premises used by appellant. On March 5, 1917, there was an average heavy rainfall, when the basement became flooded, causing damage to appellant’s goods and merchandise which, together with the cost of removing and cleaning the same, amounted to the alleged sum of $448.56. Charging the city with negligence in maintaining a main sewer on University street inadequate to meet the burden imposed upon it, resulting in the damage referred to, appellant presented to the city its duly verified claim for damages, the rejection of which occasioned this action. The city, by its answer, denied liability, and affirmatively answered, alleging contributory negligence. The case was tried without a jury. At the close of plaintiff’s case, the court granted defendant’s motion for a non-suit. Upon the request of defendant, findings of fact were made, upon which a judgment of dismissal was entered. Plaintiff appeals from the judgment.\\nOn the date mentioned, and for some years prior thereto, there was in force an ordinance of the city which, inter alia, provides:\\n“All cellar and basement drains must, when connected to sewer, ... be protected from backwater by backwater valves; said backwater valves must be provided with an air-tight clean-out cover placed immediately above valve, either screwed or bolted in place, capable of being removed for examination or repairs.” Ordinance No. 22,839, § 32.\\nIn the basement there was installed an iron manhole or receiving water tank, some two feet deep and about the same in diameter, narrower at the top, on which was placed, flush with the floor, a latticed circular iron cover having a mesh about two inches square. Within the manhole the intake of the drain pipe formed an elbow, the end of which, turned down and submerged in water when in place, was below the bottom of the stem of the drain pipe, thus forming a trap to prevent odors escaping from the sewer. On the stem of the pipe near the elbow and within the manhole there was constructed a backwater valve and cover as provided by the ordinance of the city. The drain pipe ran into a larger one from the building and thence into the University street main sewer. The water that flooded the basement poured back boiling out of the manhole.\\nIt is the contention of appellant that the incapacity of the main sewer alone caused the flooding, while the respondent claims the backwater valve had been allowed to become unclean and clogged by the fault-of appellant, thus causing the flooding and damage. The trial court found the main sewer inadequate, to which the city took no exception, and also found the appellant negligent in not keeping the backwater valve clean and in proper repair, to which appellant excepted. There is no testimony to show the backwater valve was structurally insufficient or out of repair.\\nThere was ample testimony by the head janitor, superintendent, and assistant superintendent of the building, and by E. M. Barstow, manager of appellant’s mercantile business in Seattle, all of whom witnessed the flooding, to justify the finding that all the water which caused the damage backed up from the street sewer through the drain pipe and manhole into the basement.\\nOn the other hand, O. A. Davis, appellant’s witness, a plumber and member of the firm that put in the plumbing, testified in detail as to its construction and operation, using a backwater valve to illustrate and explain its proper purpose and functions. It appears the backwater valve consisted of a solid door which hung vertically inside the drain pipe from a hinge, and when undisturbed rested against the surface of a circular collar or shoulder. Water escaping from the basement through the manhole and drain pipe would have no trouble in causing the door of the backwater valve to yield, while wafer backing up the drain pipe would force the door of the backwater valve against the shoulder and thus prevent the further passage of water, assuming always there is no debris or trash to clog the proper operation of the door of the backwater valve. The plumber stated that, if the door to the valve were free, backwater from the sewer could not pass — the harder the pressure from that direction all the better, if possible, to prevent the backwater from passing. Appellant attempted to meet the force of this testimony by showing the basement floor was cleaned at-the end of each day’s work; but considering the manner in which the backwater valve was constructed, and the further fact that there was no fine screen over either the manhole or the intake of the drain pipe, nor other device to prevent debris from getting into the valve, the flooding backward from the sewer is explainable on no reasonable theory other than that the door to the valve had been rendered useless by reason of carelessness in permitting waste matter to get into and clog the door of the backwater .valve.\\nCounsel for appellant also contends that a part of the flood water or sewage came back into the basement through the toilet. We do not so understand the proof. The rear of the basement was fifteen inches higher than that where the flood occurred. The toilet was situated in the rear basement, but all the witnesses who testified on this point said the damage was done by water pouring back through the manhole in the lower basement. The evidence does not show how the plumbing was constructed from the toilet into the sewer. One witness only, E. C. Barstow, testified there was backwater through the toilet, but the record shows that, later in the trial, when another witness was being examined with reference to this, Mr. Bar-stow, to clear np some apparent confusion, stated to the court: “Water came from the toilet but did no damage in the basement. This damage all came through the manhole.” Counsel for appellant argues that Mr. Barstow was not testifying when the statement was made. Appellant is bound by the statement, however, as an admission during trial, for Mr. Barstow was general manager for appellant in the conduct of the business which had suffered the loss, and was such manager and agent at the time of the trial.\\nThe finding of negligence against the respondent is unchallenged. The evidence preponderates in support of the finding of contributory negligence on the part of the appellant. The two acts of negligence concurring and co-operating constituted the proximate cause or occasion of the damage complained of, thus precluding a recovery. Franklin v. Engel, 34 Wash. 480, 76 Pac. 84; 20 R. C. L., Negligence, §§ 88, 89.\\nJudgment affirmed.\\nMain, C.

      "The prominent legal precedents in Washington on water leakage issues are primarily grounded in two legal principles: negligence and implied warranty of fitness. Here are the top two legal principles and how they are applied in the cases provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Negligence\n",
      "Negligence is a failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances. In the context of water leakage, this principle often involves the responsibility of landlords or municipalities to maintain premises or infrastructure to prevent foreseeable damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Cases:\n",
      "- **Le Vette v. Hardman Estate**: The Washington Supreme Court held that the landlord could be liable for damages caused by water leakage from the upper stories of a building. The court emphasized that the landlord had a duty to control and preserve the upper stories to keep them in a condition of reasonable safety, especially since the landlord knew about previous break-ins and potential water damage risks.\n",
      "- **Tombari v. City of Spokane**: The court found the city liable for damages caused by flooding due to an inadequate sewer system. The court ruled that the city should have anticipated heavy rainfall and maintained the sewer system accordingly. The city's failure to do so constituted negligence.\n",
      "- **Stevens v. King County**: The court reversed a judgment against the City of Seattle, finding insufficient evidence that the city's actions in laying a water main caused the flooding. However, the case illustrates the principle that municipalities can be held liable if their negligence in maintaining infrastructure leads to property damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Implied Warranty of Fitness\n",
      "An implied warranty of fitness arises when a seller knows the particular purpose for which goods are required and the buyer relies on the seller's skill or judgment to select suitable goods. This principle extends to services, such as the installation of flooring or other fixtures.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Cases:\n",
      "- **Frisken v. Art Strand Floor Coverings, Inc.**: The court held that the flooring contractor breached an implied warranty of fitness by installing flooring that was not suitable for the intended use. The contractor knew the conditions and the purpose of the flooring but failed to warn the buyer of potential issues with the underlying magnesite floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Grouping Prominent Cases by Principles:\n",
      "#### Negligence:\n",
      "1. **Le Vette v. Hardman Estate**\n",
      "2. **Tombari v. City of Spokane**\n",
      "3. **Stevens v. King County**\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Implied Warranty of Fitness:\n",
      "1. **Frisken v. Art Strand Floor Coverings, Inc.**\n",
      "\n",
      "These cases illustrate how Washington courts address water leakage issues through the lenses of negligence and implied warranty of fitness, holding parties accountable for failing to prevent foreseeable damage or for providing goods and services that are not fit for their intended purpose.\n"
