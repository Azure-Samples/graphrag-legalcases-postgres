They appeal from the decision of the trial court, sitting without a jury, which awarded judgment to the Lees for the face amount of a note, given by the Cloeses to secure payment of rent, together with interest and attorney\u2019s fees. The court also dismissed the claim of appellants for damages for destruction of certain goods, stock and fixtures.\nThe errors assigned deal with the court\u2019s failure to apply the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur; a holding that an exculpatory clause in the lease between the parties placed the risk of loss for damages to personal property on the premises upon appellants; and, to the court\u2019s findings of fact that an oral agreement was entered into terminating the tenancy on September 1,1969.\nThe record in this case fails to show whether the question of the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loqui-tur was presented to the trial court. We will not consider, as a ground for reversal of the trial court, a theory not presented at the time of trial. Matthias v. Lehn & Fink Prods. Corp., 70 Wn.2d 541, 424 P.2d 284 (1967); Spinelli v. Economy Stations, Inc., 71 Wn.2d 503, 429 P.2d 240 (1967).\nThe court found the evidence was insufficient to show the freezing of water pipes on the premises which resulted in damage to appellants\u2019 goods was the result of negligence on the part of respondents, or that respondents had prior notice of the defect. The finding has support in the record and the question of whether the exculpatory clause of the lease is valid will not be considered inasmuch as appellants have failed to show any breach of duty by respondents to appellants.\nThe remaining findings of fact to which error is assigned are supported by the record.

            "text": "Hunter, J.\nThis is an unlawful detainer action in which the plaintiff (respondent), Ronald D. Foisy, is seeking the possession of his real property, unpaid rent and damages. The defendant (appellant), Richard Kent Wyman, appeals from a judgment in favor of the plaintiff.\nIn his complaint, the plaintiff alleged in effect; (1) That on December 31, 1970, the defendant took possession of a house which the plaintiff is seeking to recover, pursuant to a 6-month lease requiring $300 to be paid for said term, plus water and other utility charges; (2) that during the term of the lease the defendant paid the sum of $95, leaving $205 still owing for the 6-month period; (3) that the defendant remained upon the premises after the expiration of the lease; (4) that the rental payment after the expiration of the lease was to be $75 per month; (5) that after the defendant refused to pay the accrued rent, the plaintiff served a 3-day notice to pay rent or vacate upon the defendant on August 27, 1971; (6) that the defendant failed to pay any of the amounts owing after the 3-day notice was served upon him.\nThe defendant\u2019s answer raised several affirmative defenses including breach of implied warranty of habitability.\nDuring trial the defendant testified that he took possession of the house on March 3, 1971. It appears that the parties executed the lease in question on March 8, 1971, although the lease was dated December 31, 1970, and was to cover a term of 6 months, which was to commence on January 1,1971, and end on June 30,1971.\nThe lease in question also contained an option to purchase. The testimony of the defendant indicates that he thought he was purchasing the house rather than renting it. His testimony also indicates that the house contained a number of defects when he entered into the lease and it indicates that he was aware of some of the defects when he agreed to rent the house, but not all of them.\nThe trial court concluded that the defendant was guilty of unlawful detainer of the premises rented to him by the plaintiff. However, it refused to enforce the provisions of what it termed the \u201cpurported lease.\u201d It found that the reasonable rental for the period of occupancy of the premises was the sum of $50 per month commencing with March 3, 1971, until such time as the defendant removed himself. In effect, the court held the lease was invalid. The court also held that a writ of restitution should issue to the sheriff to require the surrender of possession if the defendant did not voluntarily withdraw and that damages for the period March 3, 1971, through April 3, 1972, were to be doubled if the defendant did not surrender the premises by April 3, 1972. The defendant appeals, although the plaintiff does not cross-appeal from the court\u2019s findings.\nThe primary contention raised by the defendant is that the trial court erred in refusing to accept evidence as to his affirmative defense of breach of implied warranty of habitability. The defendant argues that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to maintain the premises in a habitable condition constitutes a failure of consideration upon the part of the plaintiff and relieves the defendant of his obligation to pay rent. We agree that the tenant should have been permitted to introduce evidence at trial in support of this theory of defense.\nThe premises in question, according to the testimony of the defendant, contained a number of defects including a lack of heat, no hot water tank, broken windows, a broken door, water running through the bedroom, an improperly seated and leaking toilet, a leaking sink in the bathroom, broken water pipes in the yard and termites in the basement. No objection was made to the introduction of this testimony. The testimony of the defendant also indicates that he painted the interior and made repairs upon the premises, but ceased making repairs when he learned of a municipal court action being initiated against the plaintiff as a result of numerous housing code violations within the house. In addition, the record reveals that the landlord was informed of the defects and was prosecuted successfully for violations of the Seattle housing code.\nDuring the trial the defendant attempted to introduce the testimony of two housing inspectors as to the housing code violations which existed on the premises. The trial court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s objections to this testimony upon the theory that the condition of the premises was not relevant to the issue before the court. We disagree with the reasoning of the trial court in refusing to accept the evidence as to the condition of the premises, although it should be stated that this issue has not been heretofore specifically addressed in this jurisdiction in relation to our unlawful detainer statutes.\nThroughout the United States, the old rule of caveat emptof in the leasing of premises has been undergoing judicial scrutiny.\nIn Pines v. Perssion, 14 Wis. 2d 590, 596, 111 N.W.2d 409 (1961), the court stated:\nTo follow the old rule of no implied warranty of habitability in leases would, in our opinion, be inconsistent with the current legislative policy concerning housing standards. The need and social desirability of adequate housing for people in this era of rapid population increases is too important to be rebuffed by that obnoxious legal clich\u00e9, caveat emptor. Permitting landlords to rent \u201ctumble-down\u201d houses is at least a contributing cause of such problems as urban blight, juvenile delinquency, and high property taxes for conscientious landowners.\nSee Reste Realty Corp. v. Cooper, 53 N.J. 444, 251 A.2d 268 (1969); Marini v. Ireland, 56 N.J. 130, 265 A.2d 526 (1970); Lemle v. Breeden, 51 Hawaii 426, 462 P.2d 470 (1969); Javins v. First Nat\u2019l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925, 27 L. Ed. 2d 185, 91 S. Ct. 186 (1970), and Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill. 2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).\nIn Lemle v. Breeden, supra, the court reviewed the rule of caveat emptor and the current trend toward finding an implied warranty of habitability in leases, and stated on page 433:\nThe application of an implied warranty of habitability in leases gives recognition to the changes in leasing transactions today. It affirms the fact that a lease is, in essence, a sale as well as a transfer of an estate in land and is, more importantly, a contractual relationship. From that contractual relationship an implied warranty of habitability and fitness for the purposes intended is a just and necessary implication. It is a doctrine which has its counterparts in the law of sales and torts and one which when candidly countenanced is impelled by the nature of the transaction and contemporary housing realities. Legal fictions and artificial exceptions to wooden rules of property law aside, we hold that in the lease of a dwelling house, such as in this case, there is an implied warranty of habitability and fitness for the use intended.\n(Footnote omitted.)\nIn Javins v. First Nat\u2019l Realty Corp., supra, the court analyzed the various exceptions to the common-law rule that the lessor has no duty to repair and stated on page 1078:\nThese as well as other similar cases demonstrate that some courts began some time ago to question the common law\u2019s assumptions that the land was the most important feature of a leasehold and that the tenant could feasibly make any necessary repairs himself. Where those assumptions no longer reflect contemporary housing patterns, the courts have created exceptions to the general rule that landlords have no duty to keep their premises in repair.\nIt is overdue for courts to admit that these assumptions are no longer true with regard to all urban housing. Today\u2019s urban tenants, the vast majority of whom live in multiple dwelling houses, are interested, not in the land, but solely in \u201ca house suitable for occupation.\u201d Furthermore, today\u2019s city dweller usually has a single, specialized skill unrelated to maintenance work; he is unable to make repairs like the \u201cjack-of-all-trades\u201d farmer who was the common law\u2019s model of the lessee. Further, unlike his agrarian predecessor who often remained on one piece of land for his entire life, urban tenants today are more mobile than ever before. A tenant\u2019s tenure in a specific apartment will often not be sufficient to justify efforts at repairs. In addition, the increasing complexity of today\u2019s dwellings renders them much more difficult to repair than the structures of earlier times. In a multiple dwelling repair may require access to equipment and areas in the control of the landlord. Low and middle income tenants, even if they were interested in making repairs, would be unable to obtain any financing for major repairs since they have no long-term interest in the property.\n(Footnotes omitted.)\nWe find the reasoning of these cases extremely persuasive. Any realistic analysis of the lessor-lessee or landlord-tenant situation leads to the conclusion that the tenant\u2019s promise to pay rent is in exchange for the landlord\u2019s promise to provide a livable dwelling. As Judge Skelly Wright stated in the Javins case on page 1074:\nWhen American city dwellers, both rich and poor, seek \u201cshelter\u201d today, they seek a well known package of goods and services \u2014 a package which includes not merely walls and ceilings, but also adequate heat, light and ventilation, serviceable plumbing facilities, secure windows and doors, proper sanitation, and proper maintenance.\n(Footnote omitted.) Javins v. First Nat'l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925, 27 L. Ed. 2d 185, 91 S. Ct. 186 (1970). The value of the lease today then, whether it is oral or written, is that it gives the tenant a place to live, and he expects not just space but a dwelling that protects him from the elements of the environment without subjecting him to health hazards.\nIn House v. Thornton, 76 Wn.2d 428, 457 P.2d 199 (1969), we rejected the doctrine of caveat emptor as it applied to the sale of a new residence and found an implied warranty that the structure is fit for the buyer\u2019s intended purpose. In doing so, we noted that the old rule of caveat emptor has little relevance to the sale of a brand-new house by a vendor-builder to a first buyer for the purposes of occupancy. By analogy, the old rule of caveat emptor has little relevance to the renting of premises in our society. There can be little justification for following a rule that was developed for an agrarian society and has failed to keep pace with modern day realities. We therefore hold that in all contracts for the renting of premises, oral or written, there is an implied warranty of habitability and breach of this warranty constitutes a defense in an unlawful detainer action. See Javins v. First Nat\u2019l Realty Corp., supra; Lund v. MacArthur, 51 Hawaii 473, 462 P.2d 482 (1969); Marini v. Ireland, 56 N.J. 130, 265 A.2d 526 (1970); Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill. 2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).\nIt can be argued, however, that the defendant should not be entitled to the protection of an implied warranty of habitability since he knew of a substantial number of defects when he rented the premises and the rent was reduced from $87 per month to $50 per month. We believe this type of bargaining by the landlord with the tenant is contrary to public policy and the purpose of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability. A disadvantaged tenant should not be placed in a position of agreeing to live in an uninhabitable premises. Housing conditions, such as the record indicates exist in the instant case, are a health hazard, not only to the individual tenant, but to the community which is exposed to said individual. As the court recognized in Pines v. Perssion, supra, such housing conditions are at least a contributing cause of such problems as urban blight, juvenile delinquency and high property taxes for the conscientious landowners.\nOur belief that public policy demands such a result is reinforced by our review of Laws of 1973, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 207, which became effective July 16, 1973. The legislature in passing this bill and the Governor in signing it have recognized that public policy demands this result. Laws of 1973, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 207, provides in part:\nSec. 6. The landlord will at all times during the tenancy keep the premises fit for human habitation, and shall in particular:\n(1) Maintain the premises to substantially comply with any applicable code, statute, ordinance, or regulation governing their maintenance or operation, which the legislative body enacting the applicable code, statute, ordinance or regulation could enforce as to the premises rented;\n(2) Maintain the roofs, floors, walls, chimneys, fireplaces, foundations, and all other structural components in reasonably good repair so as to be usable and capable of resisting any and all normal forces and loads to which they may be subjected;\n(5) Except where the condition is attributable to normal wear and tear, make repairs and arrangements necessary to put and keep the premises in as good condition as it by law or rental agreement should have been, at the commencement of the tenancy;\n(7) Maintain all electrical, plumbing, heating, and other facilities and appliances supplied by him in reasonably good working order;\n(8) Maintain the dwelling unit in reasonably weather-tight condition;\n(10) Except where the building is not equipped for the purpose, provide facilities adequate to supply heat and water and hot water as reasonably required by the tenant;\nSec. 8. The tenant shall be current in the payment of rent before exercising any of th\u00e9 remedies accorded him under the provisions of this chapter: Provided, That this section shall not be construed as limiting the tenant\u2019s civil remedies for negligent or intentional damages: Provided Further, That this section shall not be construed as limiting the tenant\u2019s right in an unlawful detainer proceeding to raise the defense that there is no rent due and owing.\nSec. 10.\n(6) Nothing in this section shall prevent the tenant from agreeing with the landlord to undertake the repairs himself in return for cash payment or a reasonable reduction in rent, the agreement thereof to be agreed upon between the parties, and such agreement does not alter the landlord\u2019s obligations under this chapter.\nIt may also be argued that the defendant should not be afforded the protection of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability since the defendant signed a lease which contained an option to purchase. However, as heretofore stated, the trial court failed to recognize the validity of the lease. There is no cross-appeal from this determination and we are therefore bound by the trial court\u2019s decision.\nThe plaintiff argues that the trial court was correct in disregarding the Seattle housing code as it was improperly pleaded and no properly authenticated copy of the housing code was offered. These issues were not before the court when it rejected the testimony of the housing inspectors. It was not until after the court had rejected the testimony of the housing inspectors on the basis of their testimony being irrelevant that the housing code was offered into evidence. Had the court rejected the housing code on the grounds suggested by the plaintiff, the defendant would have been in a position to move to amend his pleadings. The argument as to the housing code not being properly authenticated, we believe, is without merit in view of RCW 5.44.080 which states:\nWhen the ordinances of any city or town are printed by authority of such municipal corporation, the printed copies thereof shall be received as prima facie evidence that such ordinances as printed and published were duly passed.\nThe copy of the housing code that was offered into evidence by the defendant is printed by authority of the City of Seattle and is therefore prima facie evidence that the ordinances as printed and published were duly passed.\nThe testimony relating to the housing code violations should have been admitted into evidence, and the trial court erred in ruling that the condition of the premises was not relevant to the issue of rent due and owing. While the housing code violations in and of themselves do not establish a prima facie case that the premises are uninhabitable, they are evidence which aids in establishing that the premises are uninhabitable.\nThe plaintiff argues, in effect, however, that the unlawful detainer statutes are not designed for defenses such as breach of implied warranty of habitability due to the nature of the action. In light of our previous discussion, we believe this to be without merit.\nOne of the basic issues in an unlawful detainer action of this nature is whether or not there is any rent due. RCW 59.12.170, which governs the entry of judgment and execution in an unlawful detainer action, states that upon a finding of default in the payment of rent, \u201cthe judgment shall also declare the forfeiture of the lease, agreement or tenancy.\u201d RCW 59.12.030 provides:\nA tenant of real property for a term less than life is guilty of unlawful detainer either:\n(3) When he continues in possession in person or by subtenant after a default in the payment of rent, and after notice in writing requiring in the alternative the payment of the rent or the surrender of the detained premises . . .\nSince the affirmative defense of breach of implied warranty of habitability goes directly to the issue of rent due and owing, which is one of the basic issues in an unlawful detainer action as the above statutes indicate, we now hold said defense is available in an unlawful detainer action of this nature. See Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill. 2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).\nThe defendant also contends that the trial court erred in rendering judgment in the instant case, since the amount demanded in the 3-day notice was more than the trial court found was actually due and owing. We disagree.\nIn Provident Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Thrower, 155 Wash. 613, 617, 285 P. 654 (1930), we stated:\nAs to the form and contents of the notice or demand, a substantial compliance with the statute is sufficient.\nSee Sowers v. Lewis, 49 Wn.2d 891, 307 P.2d 1064 (1957). See also Erz v. Reese, 157 Wash. 32, 288 P. 255 (1930) (wherein we stated on page 35 that \u201cwe have never adopted the strictest rule of construction as to the form or contents of such notices under our unlawful detainer statutes, chiefly for the reason, doubtless, that the statutes prescribe no form.\u201d). In the Provident Mutual case the notice was defective in three respects: (1) It contained the signature of the agent rather than the owner; (2) it overstated the amount of rent due by $165 as found by the trial court; and (3) it defectively described the premises. Although we did not specifically address the issue of the overstatement of the amount of rent due, we did hold the notice substantially complied with the requirements of Rem. Comp. Stat. \u00a7 812 (now RCW 59.12.030).\nIn the instant case, the 3-day notice to pay rent or vacate the premises that was served upon the defendant called for the payment of $205, the balance due under the lease, plus $75 per month for July and August. There was no dispute as to the monthly rental payment under the terms of the purported lease; however, there was a conflict as to the amount of the monthly rental due for the months of July and August. The plaintiff testified the rent for those months was to be $75 per month, and the defendant testified that it was to be $50 per month. It appears that the plaintiff\u2019s demand for rental in the notice was in conformity with his good faith determination as to the amount of rental due, and that the defendant was not prejudiced as he could have tendered to the plaintiff the amount of rental due according to his understanding, of the agreement. See C. J. Peck, Landlord and Tenant Notices, 31 Wash. L. Rev. 51, 61 (1956). In tendering the amount due to the plaintiff, of course, he would deduct that amount due which he believed he was relieved from paying due to the landlord\u2019s breach of his implied warranty of habitability.\nWe believe that under the above facts, the plaintiff\u2019s demand for rental was in substantial compliance with the statute and the fact that there was a dispute as to the amount of rent due, which was later determined contrary to the plaintiff, should not invalidate the unlawful detainer proceeding.\nThe defendant also contends that the portion of RCW 59.12.170, which authorizes the doubling of damages, is unconstitutional as it is in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution.\nWe need not reach this issue in light of the passage of the \u201cResidential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973\u201d (Laws of 1973, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 207), which eliminated the mandatory double damage provision from the law.\nWhere substantial legislative or decisional changes in the applicable statutory provisions have been made, thereby precluding the imposition of the challenged provision, the constitutional issue need not be resolved.

See also State v. Vidal, 82 Wn.2d 74, 508 P.2d 158 (1973); State v. Baker, 81 Wn.2d 281, 501 P.2d 284 (1972).\nAs we stated in Sorenson v. Bellingham, 80 Wn.2d 547, 558, 496 P.2d 512 (1972):\nIt is a general rule that, where only moot questions or abstract propositions are involved, or where the substantial questions involved in the trial court no longer exist, the appeal, or writ of error, should be dismissed. There is an exception to the above stated proposition. The Supreme Court may, in its discretion, retain and decide an appeal which has otherwise become moot when it can be said that matters of continuing and substantial public interest are involved. . . . This exception to the general rule obtains only where the real merits of the controversy are unsettled and a continuing question of great public importance exists.\n(Citations omitted.)\nGiven the passage of the new landlord-tenant act and the absence of any actual trial court imposition of double damages in the instant case, the exception to the above rule is not in force and we therefore need not comment further upon this issue.\nFor the guidance of the trial court at the new trial to which the defendant is entitled, the finder of fact must make two findings where the defendant claims the landlord has breached his implied warranty of habitability: (1) Whether the evidence indicates that the premises were totally or partially uninhabitable during the period of habitation and, if so, (2) what portion, if any or all, of the defendant\u2019s obligation to pay rent is relieved by the landlord\u2019s total or partial breach of his implied warranty of habitability. If the finder of fact determines that the entire rental obligation is extinguished by the landlord\u2019s total breach, then the action for unlawful detainer based on nonpayment of rent must fail. If, on the other hand, the court determines that the premises are partially habitable, and the tenant failed to tender to the plaintiff a sufficient amount to pay rent due for the partially habitable premises, then judgment shall be entered in accordance with RCW 59.1^2.170.\nThe judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial consistent with this opinion.\nHale, C.J., and Rosellini, Hamilton, Stafford, and Utter, JJ., concur.\nEvidence of one or two minor infractions of a housing code which do not affect habitability are inconsequential and would not entitle the tenant to a reduction in rent. Also, the tenant\u2019s defense does not depend on official inspection or official finding of violations of a city housing code. Javins v. First Nat'l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925, 27 L. Ed. 2d 185, 91 S. Ct. 186 (1970); Diamond Housing Corp. v. Robinson, 257 A.2d 492 (D.C. Cir. 1969).",

            "text": "Brachtenbach, J.\n(dissenting) \u2014 Ignoring the defendant\u2019s own testimony, the majority casts this dispute into a traditional landlord-tenant battle and from that relationship creates an implied warranty of habitability. That creation might well be a desirable change in Washington law, but this simply is not the case in which it should be implemented.\nThe majority\u2019s application of such a warranty to the defects presented in this case and even its characterization of the defendant as a mere \u201ctenant\u201d are unsound in light of the defendant\u2019s testimony, elicited by his own counsel:\nQ. And what was the agreement between you and the Foiseys [sic] relating to the purchase of that house? A. The agreement was that I was to pay $50 a month to buy the house . . . Q. So, it was your understanding that the agreement was that you were to buy the house for $50 a month? A. That was my understanding . . . Q. At the time you moved in] were there defects on the premises? A. All kinds but I tried my best to bring them up to some remedy of standard . . . Q. What was your understanding as to what you had to do to exercise the option? A. My understanding was to clean the house up and fix it up to some degree. Q. So, in other words, you thought that\u2014 A. Take care of it like a regular home owner. I figure it was mine and I was going to try to do the best I could but I run into all kinds of difficulty with the permit . . . Q. So, it was your understanding that you were purchasing the house and that is your only obligation to pay $50 a month? A. That was the whole understanding at the conception of the deal because her mother told me [objection], Q. So, the only time prior to March you were on the premises was to just look at it? A. Right. I told them I would buy and they said fine. They put me in it for $50 a month. Q. Had you done any work cleaning up the house or anything around the premises before you moved in on [sic] March? A. Oh, yes, I had to. Q. Before you moved in? A. Right, I had to. In the basement there was termites and there was things. Q. When were you doing those things? A. In February . . . Q. At that time did you have any agreement with the Foiseys [sic] as to whether or not you were going to purchase it? A. I had the agreement before I walked in that house. That\u2019s when they told me you can have it for $50 a month. They wanted $87 a month. I said it isn\u2019t worth it because it\u2019s sitting still and the windows are out. '[Interruption.] Q. That understanding was that you were going to pay $50 per month? A. Correct. That is the only way I would walk in that house because I wasn\u2019t in the proper position to bargain. They bargained to me because I saw a deal and I grabbed it . . . Q. As far as you were concerned, you never received any word that you were anything but a purchaser, is that right? A. To my knowledge, that was the only way I would have gone into that house as a purchaser. What would I want to rent it for I had a house of my own.\nFrom that testimony it is perfectly clear that the defendant waS fully aware of the defects and deficiencies in the premises. Those defects and deficiencies were the very reason he was willing and able to negotiate lower payments.\nIt requires no authority to sustain the proposition that a person who takes possession of premises with known defects, intends to repair those defects, bargains for reduced monthly payments and characterizes the transaction as a \u201cdeal\u201d which he \u201cgrabbed,\u201d neither deserves nor needs the protection of an implied warranty of habitability.\nThe fact of the matter, apparent from the record, is that the defendant encountered difficulties with his continued, anticipated repairs when the housing code violations pending against the plaintiffs came to light. That situation might give rise to other remedies, but they are not asserted here.\nBut apart from the foregoing, and even if the defendant is to be characterized as a tenant in the strict legal sense of that word, the majority fails to recognize that the Seattle housing code was not properly before the trial court.\nIn his answer, affirmative defense and counterclaim, the defendant alleged violations of the provisions of the housing, building, fire, health and sanitation codes of the City of Seattle. Such shotgun pleading is a clear violation of CR 9 (i). At the time of trial, absolutely no proof of the housing code was provided, except to offer an unauthenticated, unidentified booklet entitled \u201cHousing Code, City of Seattle.\u201d The trial court, on that ground alone, correctly rejected testimony about violations of a city ordinance which had not been properly pleaded, properly authenticated or properly identified.\nThe trial court should be affirmed.\nWright, J., concurs with Brachtenbach, J.",

            "text": "Brachtenbach, J.\nThis suit concerns a 99-year ground lease. The main issue is the meaning of the rent payment clause. The trial court granted summary judgment to the landlord, held that the lease was not ambiguous, determined the meaning of the rental clause, and awarded back rent to the landlord based upon the trial court's interpretation of the rental clause. By unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed in the main but remanded for determination of certain facts which existed at the inception of the lease. We reverse the trial court, modify the Court of Appeals opinion, and remand for trial.\nThe ground lease, executed in 1959, terminates in 2058. The ground tenant, defendant, removed a residence from the property, as allowed by the lease agreement, and constructed a commercial building on the land. This commercial building was originally leased to Safeway Stores for 15 years. Upon Safeway's removal, the tenant converted the building to a small shopping center which was subleased to a number of tenants during the period at issue.\nIn August 1987, the landlord brought the present suit, contending that for several years the defendant incorrectly calculated the rent due the landlord under the ground lease.\nAs will be seen, the rent due the landlord under the ground lease is calculated with respect to what constitutes \"gross rentals\" from the subtenants and what may be deducted therefrom to ascertain \"net rentals.\" \"Net rentals\" is the amount to which a formula set out in the ground lease applies for division of income between the landlord and the tenant, the parties in this suit.\nThe lease contains the following provision:\n(3) Rental. The rental shall be Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($5,000.00) per year, payable in advance on or before the 19th day of October, 1959, of each year during the term of this lease. Receipt of Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($5,000.00) paid as rental for the first year of said term is hereby acknowledged.\nIt is expressly provided that on the first of the month in which the annual rent falls due, Lessee, prior to paying the annual rental of $5,000.00, each year during the term hereof, commencing with the fifteenth (15) year, shall refer to the then current United States Consumer Price Index (all items) as compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor (1947 - 1949 = 100). If such index reading at date hereof reflects an increase or decrease in the purchasing power of the United States Dollar equal to five percent (5%) or more, the minimum rent payment hereunder shall be proportionately increased or decreased to the end that rent payments are annually adjusted to maintain the same purchasing power they represented at date hereof, provided that the total increase or decrease above or below the original rental of $5,000.00 per year shall in no event exceed three percent (3%) multiplied by the number of years of said term which shall have expired. In the event the said Consumer Price Index is modified or replaced, the comparable effective cost of living index published by the United States Department of Labor or other Federal agency shall be employed using reasonable and accepted conversion factors as necessary.\nIn addition to the above mentioned rental, Lessee shall pay ten (10%) per cent of net rentals received after the third year of said term from tenants of any buildings constructed on said property. If Lessee uses or enters into any agreement for the use of said property or any portion thereof for parking or thoroughfare purposes for the benefit of any business conducted in a building or buildings on other property, a portion of any such building or buildings shall be assumed to be on the above described property for the purpose of computing rental hereto. Said portion shall be in the same proportion as the area of the above described property used for such purposes bears to the total area used for building, parking and thoroughfare purposes for the benefit of such business. Net rentals shall be defined as gross rentals from the actual tenants, less payments made for taxes and assessments, insurance on said premises, management fees not to exceed five (5%) per cent of gross rentals and real estate commissions not to exceed five (5%) per cent of the gross rentals for the first ten (10) years and two-and-a-half (2 1/2%) per cent of the gross rentals thereafter, and depreciation actually taken for income tax purposes.\nCommencing with the sixteenth (16) year after completion of the first building constructed on said property, the rental shall be as computed above, or it shall be fifty (50%) per cent of net rentals, whichever is greater.\nLessor shall have the right each year for a period of ten (10) consecutive working days selected by them to audit those books of Lessee pertaining to rentals received by Lessee from such tenants.\nClerk's Papers (July 5, 1988), at 8-9.\nPlaintiff-landlord moved for partial summary judgment, asking the court to declare that the same formula for calculating the percentage rent due the landlord applied throughout the term of the lease, that all receipts from subtenants be included in \"gross rentals,\" and that only those expenses listed as deductible in the formula are deductible in calculating rent due. The landlord relied solely on the written lease. The landlord's motion for partial summary judgment was filed before any responsive pleading was filed.\nThe trial court granted the motion for partial summary judgment, and held that the rental provisions are clear and unambiguous. Defendant then moved to vacate the order granting partial summary judgment or, alternatively, to modify that order to provide that any reimbursements from the subtenants be excluded from the definition of \"gross rentals\" unless the expenses for which the reimbursements were made can be deducted to determine \"net rentals.\" In support of the motion to vacate or modify, defendant submitted affidavits of intent and the circumstances surrounding the making of the lease.\nIn the meantime, the landlord filed a final summary judgment motion for a judgment against defendant for past rent due plus interest. The trial court denied defendant's motion and granted the second summary judgment motion. In denying defendant's motion, the trial court (different from the one which granted partial summary judgment) specifically found that \"the affidavits submitted by defendant in support of the motion to vacate are not subject to being considered, and, even if considered, do not alter or modify the clear and unambiguous language of Section 3 of the Lease.\" Clerk's Papers (July 5, 1988), at 129.\nDefendant-tenant appealed, contending that summary judgment was improperly granted. The tenant advanced two theories, either of which would raise factual issues: First, whether the lease is only a partially integrated contract, i.e., whether the writing is a final expression of those terms which it contains, but not a complete expression of all terms agreed upon, Emrich v. Connell, 105 Wn.2d 551, 716 P.2d 863 (1986); and second, whether the rental clause is ambiguous. Speaking generally, either situation would allow extrinsic evidence to prove omitted but not inconsistent terms, or to determine the intent of the parties.\nThe Court of Appeals reversed in part, and attempted to provide a definition of gross rentals by limiting it to payments of the exact same character as the tenant received from his original subtenants under the first subleases. The Court of Appeals added another condition, i.e., that even if the payments by subtenants are not of the same character as payments made by the original subtenants, they constitute gross rentals to the extent the tenant would be required to include them as gross income for tax purposes. The Court of Appeals based its definitions of gross rentals upon what it believed to be the intent of the drafter of the lease.\nThe Court of Appeals then remanded for resolution of factual questions regarding what expenses were paid by original subtenants and whether the amounts deducted by the tenant are of the same character as payments made by the original subtenants for maintenance, repairs, and improvements of the property.\nThe landlord sought review by this court.\nIn broad terms, the question posed is the interpretation of the subject lease. Inherent in resolution of that issue are the matters of integration, ambiguity, plain meaning and parol evidence.\nBefore examining the specific issues raised herein an overview of the problems of interpretation of contracts is necessary. We use the word \"interpretation\" in the sense described by Corbin and the Restatement and distinguish it from \"construction.\" Corbin states: \"Interpretation is the process whereby one person gives a meaning to the symbols of expression used by another person.\" 3 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 532, at 2 (1960). The Restatement definition is: \"Interpretation of a promise or agreement or a term thereof is the ascertainment of its meaning.\" Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 200 (1981).\nConstruction of a contract determines its legal effect. \"Construction . . . is a process by which legal consequences are made to follow from the terms of the contract and its more or less immediate context, and from a legal policy or policies that are applicable to the situation.\" Patterson, The Interpretation and Construction of Contracts, 64 Colum. L. Rev. 833, 835 (1964). See 3 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 534 (1960 & Supp. 1990).\nIt is deceptively simple to state the purpose of a court in interpreting a contract. \"The cardinal rule with which all interpretation begins is that its purpose is to ascertain the intention of the parties.\" Corbin, The Interpretation of Words and the Parol Evidence Rule, 50 Cornell L. Quar. 161, 162 (1965). 4 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 601, at 306 (3d ed. 1961). See Eurick v. Pemco Ins. Co., 108 Wn.2d 338, 340, 738 P.2d 251 (1987); In re Estates of Wahl, 99 Wn.2d 828, 830-31, 664 P.2d 1250 (1983); Dwelley v. Chesterfield, 88 Wn.2d 331, 335, 560 P.2d 353 (1977).\nAs would be expected, problems of contract interpretation have long been a source of judicial opinion. E.g., Smith v. Wilson, 3 B. & A. 728, 110 Eng. Rep. 266 (K.B. 1832) (where \"thousand\" was held to mean \"1,200\"); Raffles v. Wichelhaus, 2 H. & C. 906, 159 Eng. Rep. 375 (Ex. 1864). The subject has produced thousands of cases, numerous texts and countless commentaries. A study of these materials, including Washington cases, leads us to concur with the observation: \"[T]he rules produced by accumulated decisions as to how such discovery [of the parties' intention] shall be conducted often overlap and sometimes produce hindrance rather than help, while reconciliation of all cases is a task neither possible nor worth the effort . . .\". Nicoll v. Pittsvein Coal Co., 269 F. 968, 971 (2d Cir. 1920).\nIn approaching contract interpretation every court should heed the strong words of Corbin:\n[I]t can hardly be insisted on too often or too vigorously that language at its best is always a defective and uncertain instrument, that words do not define themselves, that terms and sentences in a contract, a deed, or a will do not apply themselves to external objects and performances, that the meaning of such terms and sentences consists of the ideas that they induce in the mind of some individual person who uses or hears or reads them, and that seldom in a litigated case do the words of a contract convey one identical meaning to the two contracting parties or to third persons.\n3 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 536, at 27-28 (1960). Holmes was more poetic: \"'A word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged; it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.'\" (Footnote omitted.) 4 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 609, at 402 (3d ed. 1961) (quoting Towne v. Eisner, 245 U.S. 418, 425, 62 L. Ed. 372, 38 S. Ct. 158 (1918)).\nA second major point applicable to contract interpretation is that the various principles of interpretation should not be applied as absolutes. They \"are to be taken as suggestive working rules only. . . . They will be harmful if they are taken as dogmatic directions that must be followed, or if they mislead us into thinking that language has only one meaning, the one absolutely correct.\" (Footnote omitted.) 3 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 535, at 21 (1960).\nVarious efforts have been made to compile a set of rules of contract interpretation. E.g., Patterson, The Interpretation and Construction of Contracts, 64 Colum. L. Rev. 833, 852 (1964) (listing 10 \"standard maxims\" of contract interpretation); see Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 202 (1981) (listing rules in aid of interpretation). Each set of rules is subject to Corbin's caution. \"There is some doubt whether they [maxims of interpretation] have reliable guidance value for judges, or are merely justifications for decisions arrived at on other grounds, which may or may not be revealed in the opinion.\" Patterson, 64 Colum. L. Rev. at 852; see Green River Vly. Found., Inc. v. Foster, 78 Wn.2d 245, 252, 473 P.2d 844 (1970) (Finley, J., concurring); cf. Eurick v. Pemco Ins. Co., supra at 340-41 (\"rules of construction are not goals in themselves but only aids to interpretation\").\nWith the above observations in mind we turn to the central issue of contract interpretation in this case.\nThere remains to be discussed the interpretation issue which presents the greatest difficulty. If the disputed language is written, will the proponent of one meaning be permitted to aid his cause by verbal testimony? If so, what is the permissible range such testimony can take? On these important details the Washington cases are in confusion.\nThere are cases in which the court examined the circumstances surrounding the execution of a writing as an aid to its interpretation and sustained the admissibility of the pertinent evidence even though the writing might on its face be unambiguous. The position taken in these cases is the one endorsed by Professors Corbin and Williston and by the Restatement of Contracts. It is the only approach which can consistently yield interpretations likely to coincide with the meanings the parties contemplated.\nThere are other cases in which the court indicated that it will not look beyond the four corners of a contract writing unless what appears within those four corners is ambiguous. The reason is variously stated as an interpretation principle, or as an application of the parol evidence rule. Neither reason is persuasive.\n(Footnotes omitted.) Shattuck, Contracts in Washington, 1937-1957: Part II, 34 Wash. L. Rev. 345, 374-76 (1959). Professor Shattuck cites a number of cases as examples of the contrasting analyses. See Shattuck, 34 Wash. L. Rev. at 374 n.403, 376 n.406.\nDespite the accuracy of the conclusion that seldom will any word or phrase carry only a single meaning which is readily discernible by any reader, this court on occasion has embraced the \"plain meaning rule.\"\nThe Plain Meaning Rule states that if a writing, or the term in question, appears to be plain and unambiguous on its face, its meaning must be determined from the four corners of the instrument without resort to extrinsic evidence of any nature.\n(Footnote omitted.) J. Calamari & J. Perillo, Contracts \u00a7 3-10, at 166-67 (3d ed. 1987). In following this rule, this court has held that only if a contract is ambiguous on its face will the court look to evidence of the parties' intent as shown by the contract as a whole, its subject matter and objective, the circumstances of its making, the subsequent conduct of the parties, and the reasonableness of their interpretations. E.g., St. Yves v. Mid State Bank, 111 Wn.2d 374, 378, 757 P.2d 1384 (1988); Boeing Airplane Co. v. Firemen's Fund Indem. Co., 44 Wn.2d 488, 496, 268 P.2d 654, 45 A.L.R.2d 984 (1954); Bellingham Sec. Syndicate, Inc. v. Bellingham Coal Mines, Inc., 13 Wn.2d 370, 384, 125 P.2d 668 (1942).\nThe plain meaning rule has been criticized by leading commentators. See, e.g., 3 A. Corbin \u00a7 542; 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 2461-2462 (1981); 4 S. Williston \u00a7 629; 2 E. Farnsworth, Contracts \u00a7 7.12, at 277-78 (1990); J. Calamari & J. Perillo \u00a7 3-10. The rule has been rejected by the Uniform Commercial Code, U.C.C. \u00a7 2-202 comment 2, and the Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 2002-04 (1981).\nAs Professor Shattuck notes, however, even while sometimes following the plain meaning rule, this court has not consistently applied it. Instead, the court has also sometimes held that a trial court may, in interpreting contract language, consider the surrounding circumstances leading to execution of the agreement, including the subject matter of the contract as well as the subsequent conduct of the parties, not for the purpose of contradicting what is in the agreement, but for the purpose of determining the parties' intent. See, e.g., Stender v. Twin City Foods, Inc., 82 Wn.2d 250, 510 P.2d 221 (1973); In re Estate of Garrity, 22 Wn.2d 391, 156 P.2d 217 (1945); Leavenworth State Bank v. Cashmere Apple Co., 118 Wash. 356, 204 P. 5 (1922). As stated in Stender:\nDetermination of the intent of the contracting parties is to be accomplished by viewing the contract as a whole, the subject matter and objective of the contract, all the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract, the subsequent acts and conduct of the parties to the contract, and the reasonableness of respective interpretations advocated by the parties.\nStender, at 254. This analytic framework for interpreting written contract language has been called the \"context rule.\" Eagle Ins. Co. v. Albright, 3 Wn. App. 256, 474 P.2d 920 (1970). See Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. G.W. Thomas Drayage & Rigging Co., 69 Cal. 2d 33, 442 P.2d 641, 69 Cal. Rptr. 561, 40 A.L.R.3d 1373 (1968) for an excellent articulation of the rationale of the context principle. Other courts have allowed evidence of the circumstances of the making of a contract for the purpose of interpreting the contract. E.g., Darner Motor Sales, Inc. v. Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., 140 Ariz. 383, 682 P.2d 388 (1984); Admiral Builders Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. South River Landing, Inc., 66 Md. App. 124, 502 A.2d 1096 (1986); Keating v. Stadium Mgt. Corp., - Mass. App. Ct. -, 508 N.E.2d 121 (1987).\nThe instant case presents a clear opportunity for this court to resolve the long-standing confusion engendered by inconsistent holdings in this area.\nWe now hold that extrinsic evidence is admissible as to the entire circumstances under which the contract was made, as an aid in ascertaining the parties' intent. We adopt the Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 212, 214(c) (1981). Section 212 provides:\n(1) The interpretation of an integrated agreement is directed to the meaning of the terms of the writing or writings in the light of the circumstances, in accordance with the rules stated in this Chapter.\n(2) A question of interpretation of an integrated agreement is to be determined by the trier of fact if it depends on the credibility of extrinsic evidence or on a choice among reasonable inferences to be drawn from extrinsic evidence. Otherwise a question of interpretation of an integrated agreement is to be determined as a question of law.\nAs explained in comment b to this section:\nIt is sometimes said that extrinsic evidence cannot change the plain meaning of a writing, but meaning can almost never be plain except in a context. Accordingly, the rule stated in Subsection (1) is not limited to cases where it is determined that the language used is ambiguous. Any determination of meaning or ambiguity should only be made in the light of the relevant evidence of the situation and relations of the parties, the subject matter of the transaction, preliminary negotiations and statements made therein, usages of trade, and the course of dealing between the parties.\nThis court's line of cases which includes Stender v. Twin City Foods, Inc., supra, is in line with the Restatement and is in line with ascertaining the parties' actual intent.\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 214(c) provides that\n[agreements and negotiations prior to or contemporaneous with the adoption of a writing are admissible in evidence to establish\n(c) the meaning of the writing, whether or not integrated;\nComment b to this section explains:\nWords, written or oral, cannot apply themselves to the subject matter. The expressions and general tenor of speech used in negotiations are admissible to show the conditions existing when the writing was made, the application of the words, and the meaning or meanings of the parties. Even though words seem on their face to have only a single possible meaning, other meanings often appear when the circumstances are disclosed. In cases of misunderstanding, there must be inquiry into the meaning attached to the words by each party and into what each knew or had reason to know.\nIn discerning the parties' intent, subsequent conduct of the contracting parties may be of aid, and the reasonableness of the parties' respective interpretations may also be a factor in interpreting a written contract.\nWe note with approval the following general statement of the context rule, which we reaffirm, contained in J.W. Seavey Hop Corp. v. Pollock, 20 Wn.2d 337, 348-49, 147 P.2d 310 (1944):\nMay we say here that we are mindful of the general rule that parol evidence is not admissible for the purpose of adding to, modifying, or contradicting the terms of a written contract, in the absence of fraud, accident, or mistake. But, as stated in Olsen v. Nichols, 86 Wash. 185, 149 P. 668 [(1915)], parol evidence is admissible to show the situation of the parties and the circumstances under which a written instrument was executed, for the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the parties and properly construing the writing. Such evidence, however, is admitted, not for the purpose of importing into a writing an intention not expressed therein, but with the view of elucidating the meaning of the words employed. Evidence of this character is admitted for the purpose of aiding in the interpretation of what is in the instrument, and not for the purpose of showing intention independent of the instrument. It is the duty of the court to declare the meaning of what is written, and not what was intended to be written. If the evidence goes no further than to show the situation of the parties and the circumstances under which the instrument was executed, then it is admissible.\nPollock, at 348-49.\nWe thus reject the theory that ambiguity in the meaning of contract language must exist before evidence of the surrounding circumstances is admissible. Cases to the contrary are overruled.\nAnother issue involving interpretation which may be relevant in this case concerns the possibility that language used in the lease is technical or constitutes terms of art. If so, the general rule is that such language is to be given its technical meaning when used in a transaction within its technical field. Keeton v. Department of Social & Health Servs., 34 Wn. App. 353, 361, 661 P.2d 982, review denied, 99 Wn.2d 1022 (1983); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 202(3)(b) (1981). Additionally, it is possible that the parties have attached different meanings to certain terms used, and, if so, the rules set out in Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 201 provide guidance.\nFinally, before examining the written ground lease, some discussion of defendant's claim that the lease is not a fully integrated instrument is in order. The first point to be made is that the question of integration, and the role of parol evidence in deciding the integration question, is not the same inquiry as the role of parol, or extrinsic, evidence in interpreting a contract. The \"parol evidence rule\" relates to the former, but not to the latter.\nUnder the parol evidence rule,\n[Pjarol or extrinsic evidence is not admissible to add to, subtract from, vary, or contradict written instruments which are contractual in nature and which are valid, complete, unambiguous, and not affected by accident, fraud, or mistake.\nSt. Yves v. Mid State Bank, 111 Wn.2d 374, 377, 757 P.2d 1384 (1988) (quoting Emrich v. Connell, 105 Wn.2d 551, 555-56, 716 P.2d 863 (1986) (quoting Buyken v. Ertner, 33 Wn.2d 334, 341, 205 P.2d 628 (1949))).\n\" [T]he parol evidence rule only applies to a writing intended by the parties as an 'integration' of their agreement; i.e., a writing intended as a final expression of the terms of the agreement.\" Emrich, at 556. Where a contract is only partially integrated, i.e., the writing is a final expression of those terms which it contains but not a complete expression of all terms agreed upon, the terms not included in the writing may be proved by extrinsic evidence provided that the additional terms are not inconsistent with the written terms. Emrich, at 556.\nDefendant-tenant argued to the Court of Appeals that the lease contract was not fully integrated and therefore the parol evidence rule did not apply. This issue arguably was not raised before the trial court, and thus arguably should not be considered by an appellate court. See RAP 9.12 (on review of order granting or denying summary judgment motion, \"appellate court will consider only evidence and issues called to the attention of the trial court\"). Moreover, the tenant did not renew this argument in the answer to the petition for review.\nHowever, we need not reach the question of integration nor do we decide whether the matter is properly subject to appellate review in this case. In light of our adoption of the context rule for interpreting written contracts in accord with the parties' intent, the summary judgment in favor of the landlord must be reversed and this matter must be remanded for trial. As noted, the trial court refused to consider evidence as to the circumstances surrounding the contract under the now disapproved \"plain meaning rule.\" As explained hereafter, there are material questions of fact remaining as to the intent of the contracting parties and interpretation of the ground lease.\nUpon remand, the tenant may argue the integration issue. It may be that the lease is an integrated document; if so, it remains to be interpreted. If not, additional terms may be proved insofar as they are not inconsistent with the written terms. While we do not decide the question, we note that it is a reasonable inference from the affidavit of the original tenant's attorney that there were agreements and intentions not expressed in the written lease.\nThe lease in this case well illustrates why extrinsic evidence is necessary to assist the court in interpreting words and applying them to the actual events in order to ascertain and implement the intentions of the parties.\nThe lease provides for a possible alternative computation of rent commencing with the 16th year. The record discloses that the original tenant's sublease, the Safeway Stores lease, was for 15 years. The parties had no dispute as to rent calculation during those 15 years. The Safeway lease is relevant because the rental clause calls for a different formula \" [commencing with the sixteenth (16) year after completion of the first building constructed on said property\". That lease (which constitutes extrinsic evidence) is not in the record and was not considered by the trial court. How do the terms of the original lease bear on the meaning and purpose of the different rent formula in the ground lease which comes into operation at the end of that sublease?\n\"Gross rentals\" is the starting point for determining the division between the landlord and the tenant, but the term \"gross rentals\" is not defined. What did the parties intend to be the meaning of that phrase? The trial court held the term included \"all amounts received from subtenants of the shopping center.\" Under this interpretation the ground tenant is out of pocket 50 percent of the reimbursement from the subtenants. For example, if the ground tenant pays out $10,000 for common area maintenance and is reimbursed that $10,000 by a subtenant, he is then whole, but under the trial court's holding, he must pay $5,000 to the landlord.\nIn actual operation, according to the record, in 1 year actual common maintenance expenses paid by the ground tenant were $28,952.78. By reimbursement from subtenants the ground tenant is made whole, i.e., he neither loses nor gains. But under the landlord's interpretation, adopted by the trial court, the tenant must (1) include $28,952.78 in gross rents, and (2) cannot deduct those actual expenses to calculate net rentals against which the 50 percent rental formula is applied. Therefore, the tenant must pay $14,476.39 to the landlord.\nGiven this result, if the trial court determines the language is subject to two possible constructions, it should apply the following principle:\nWhen a provision is subject to two possible constructions, one of which would make the contract unreasonable and imprudent and the other of which would make it reasonable and just, we will adopt the latter interpretation. Dickson v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co., 77 Wn.2d 785, 790, 466 P.2d 515 (1970).\nFisher Properties, Inc. v. Arden-Mayfair, Inc., 106 Wn.2d 826, 837, 726 P.2d 8 (1986); see Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 203(a) (1981).\nIn contrast to the trial court's interpretation of the lease, the Court of Appeals held that if such expenses had been paid directly by a subtenant, they were not gross rentals. The Court of Appeals held that so long as reimbursements were of the exact same nature as those paid by the original subtenants they were not gross rentals. Apparently the Court of Appeals divined the intent of the parties for 99 years from the terms of the first 15-year sublease, but modified that by excluding direct payments by subtenants to the extent that the landlord would have to include such direct payments within his income for federal income tax purposes. We find no support in the record that the treatment of a money item was to be governed by federal income tax law. We note that when income tax law was relevant, it was expressly so provided, e.g., the deduction for depreciation in arriving at \"net rental\" referred to \"depreciation actually taken for income tax purposes.\" (As an aside, we note that even that specificity could create a problem of interpretation if the tax deduction allowed by Internal Revenue Service were different from that actually taken.)\nAdding to the problem of interpretation of the parties' lease, the language \"gross rentals from actual tenants\" requires reference to rental income from the subtenants. The only sublease in the record provides for the subtenant to pay a proportionate share of specified expenses, including operating expenses and expenses of maintaining common areas of the shopping center. However, the sublease specifically states that such proportionate share is \"in addition to the rent.\" What is the effect of the subleases' characterization of income?\nFurther questions remain. Under the lease definition of \"net rentals,\" the ground tenant could deduct from the proportionate share paid by subtenants those amounts representing taxes and insurance, but not amounts paid out of pocket for common area maintenance and operation. The amount reimbursed to the ground tenant is significant, e.g., $28,952.78 in the rent year ending in October 1987. The trial court even included within gross rentals interest paid to the ground tenant on funds held by the property manager before rent was due the landlord. These facts seem to require application of the principle noted above that the court should take into account \"the reasonableness of respective interpretations advocated by the parties.\" Stender v. Twin City Foods, Inc., 82 Wn.2d 250, 254, 510 P.2d 221 (1973).\nContinuing the interpretation confusion is the fact that the lease provides that its term shall be 99 years. Paragraph 3 provides: \"The rental shall be Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($5,000.00) per year ... of each year during the term of this lease.\" (Italics ours.) The lease later describes the $5,000 as \"minimum rent payment hereunder\" with an adjustment consistent with the Consumer Price Index. Clerk's Papers (July 5, 1988), at 8.\nThe lease goes on to provide that \"[i]n addition to the above mentioned rental,\" there shall be paid a percentage of net rent after the third year. Clerk's Papers (July 5, 1988), at 9. Thus, from the third year through the 15th year, it is clear that the $5,000 is paid in addition to the specified percentage of net rentals. The problem arises from the language applicable to the 16th year and subsequent years. It provides that the rented shall be \"as computed above\" (i.e., the adjusted $5,000 plus 10 percent of net rentals) or \"it shall be fifty (50%) per cent of net rentals, whichever is greater.\" Clerk's Papers (July 5, 1988), at 9. The obvious question is whether the minimum rent is in addition to the 50 percent or is no longer to be considered. Preceding the 50 percent language the lease provides in two separate paragraphs that the $5,000, as adjusted, shall be paid \"each year during the term hereof.\" The lease defines the \"term\" as 99 years. If the rent is to be calculated under the phrase \"or it shall be fifty (50%) per cent of net rentals,\" without the additional minimum rent, there is a conflict with the provision that the $5,000, as adjusted, shall be paid every year during the 99-year term.\nAvoidance of this conflict presents another problem, however. If $5,000 is to be paid every year during the lease term, in addition to a percentage of net rentals, then the language applicable to the 16th year and thereafter seems to make no sense. That is, $5,000 (as adjusted) plus 10 percent of net rentals would be compared to $5,000 (as adjusted) plus 50 percent of net rentals.\nAnother significant question of intent and meaning arises from the listing of permissible deductions from gross rentals to arrive at net rentals. This question exists even under the landlord's contention that the only deductions from gross rentals are those defined in the lease. The question comes from the authorization to deduct \"real estate commissions not to exceed five (5%) per cent of the gross rentals for the first ten (10) years and two-and-a-half (2\u00bd %) per cent of the gross rentals thereafter.\u201d Clerk's Papers (July 5, 1988), at 9. The landlord contends that the limitation for deductible real estate commissions refers to the years of the master lease. That is, during the first 10 years of the 99-year term, the ground tenant can deduct up to 5 percent of the gross rentals for real estate commissions and only 2\u00bd percent for the remaining 89 years. The ground tenant argues that this limitation refers to the length of the terms of the subleases. Thus, if, in the 20th year of the master lease, there was negotiated a 15-year sublease, the ground tenant could deduct up to 5 percent of the gross rent for real estate commissions from that particular lease for 10 years and up to 2\u00bd percent for the remaining 5 years. Again, the differences in the respective contentions are significant. In the lease year ending in October 1986, the ground tenant paid and deducted real estate commissions of $30,141; the landlord's interpretation allowed only $5,067.78.\nA major point of dispute is how to arrive at \"net rentals\" for the 50/50 percent division after the 15th year. Stated again, the lease provides that at that time: u[T]he rental shall be as computed above, or it shall be fifty (50%) per cent of net rentals, whichever is greater.\" (Italics ours.) Clerk's Papers (July 5, 1988), at 9. The phrase \"as computed above\" can only refer to the preceding paragraph which calls for the minimum $5,000, as adjusted, plus 10 percent of the net rentals. \"Net rentals\" is defined as \"gross rentals [undefined] from the actual tenants, less payments made for taxes and assessments, insurance on said premises, management fees not to exceed five (5%) per cent of gross rentals and real estate commissions ... [as above described], and depreciation actually taken for income tax purposes.\" Clerk's Papers (July 5, 1988), at 9.\nThe question is whether the phrase \"net rentals\" to which the 50 percent applies means the same as is defined in the preceding paragraph and particularly whether the deductions from gross rentals are limited to those authorized in arriving at the sum to which the \"10 percent of net rentals\u201d is applied. What the parties intended is not clear. When calculating the sum to which the 10 percent applies, after the 15th year, reference is made to the methodology of the preceding paragraph. The 50 percent calculation is preceded by the word \"or\u201d and \"net rentals\" is not referenced to the preceding paragraph as it is in the first part of the sentence. The ground tenant argues that the change from a $5,000 adjusted minimum plus 10 percent of the defined net rentals to 50 percent of undefined net rentals necessarily means that the parties intended a different formula to arrive at a 50/50 percent division of net rentals. He supports his position with the fact that this change in formula coincided with the termination of the known term of the 15-year lease of the first subtenant, that the ground tenant's improvements represent two-thirds of the assessed value of the land and improvements, and that the interpretation and intent he advances is that commonly understood by those operating within the realm of long-term ground leases. This latter point is supported by affidavits from persons with knowledge of such standards.\nFrom accountings in the record, the tenant constructs a model of net incomes to each party under the landlord's theory. In his worst scenario the landlord in 1 year nets $63,280 and the tenant $1,160. In the best year for the tenant, his figures show $80,108 to the landlord and $59,106 to the tenant. The tenant contends that over a 5-year period the average net return is 77 percent to the landlord and 23 percent to the tenant. By setting forth the tenant's contentions on this point we do not mean to imply that they are correct or factually established. What the illustrations do raise is the initial question whether the parties in fact did intend such results. If they did so intend, so be it. However, if it is determined that was not their intent, then the court must determine a more reasonable interpretation from all the circumstances.\nFrom the record it appears that the lease was drafted by the landlord's attorney. Depending on evidence adduced on remand, it may be proper for the court to construe ambiguous language against the drafter's client. Guy Stickney, Inc. v. Underwood, 67 Wn.2d 824, 827, 410 P.2d 7 (1966); Universal/Land Constr. Co. v. Spokane, 49 Wn. App. 634, 638, 745 P.2d 53 (1987); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 206 (1981).\nLastly, in anticipation of proceedings after remand, it is necessary to consider the legal effect, if any, of the fact that the landlord accepted the ground tenant's accountings and rent payments for a period of at least 4 years before challenging the deductions from gross rentals. Those deductions were disclosed in the accountings and were greater than allowed by the landlord's interpretation of the lease. The Court of Appeals characterized this as an estoppel argument not raised at trial nor briefed on appeal; therefore, the Court of Appeals refused to consider it. However, estoppel is not the thrust of the tenant's argument. The tenant's accountings and acceptance of payment in accordance therewith have been part of the record from the beginning. They are attached to the plaintiff's complaint. On their face they show deductions not permitted by the landlord's interpretation as asserted in the complaint and subsequently. From the complaint it appears that the landlord accepted these figures for 3 or 4 years without objection.\nThis acceptance of accountings and payments over a period of years may be considered as an aid to ascertainment of the intent of the parties. It is well established that subsequent acts and conduct of the parties to the contract are admissible to assist in ascertaining their intent. Stender v. Twin City Foods, Inc., 82 Wn.2d 250, 254, 510 P.2d 221 (1973); Carlyle v. Majewski, 174 Wash. 687, 690, 26 P.2d 79 (1933); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 202(4) (1981). This point was raised factually in the trial court by the tenant's affidavit. Clerk's Papers (July 5, 1988), at 36. It was raised legally in the tenant's memorandum in opposition to summary judgment, including citations to Washington cases. Clerk's Papers (July 5, 1988), at 105. On appeal, the tenant factually and legally raised the point. Brief of Appellant, at 13, 40, 49-50. Thus, contrary to the statement by the Court of Appeals, the evidence of the landlord's acceptance of the tenant's accountings and payments in accordance therewith was asserted throughout the proceedings and for the legitimate purpose of aiding in determining intent.\nAs to an estoppel argument, in contrast, the only reference to estoppel is in a footnote in appellant's brief where it is noted: \"Aside from proof of the parties' intent, [the landlord's] conduct over five (5) years constituted an estoppel and/or waiver. Here, summary judgment was granted even before affirmative defenses were asserted in an answer.\" Brief of Appellant, at 50 n.6. This evidence was not considered by the trial court because that court excluded all evidence extrinsic to the lease. Whether affirmative defenses of waiver and estoppel are pleaded on remand awaits proceedings below. Thus, it remains to be seen whether the evidence may be considered.\nIn conclusion, it is apparent from our analysis of the contract language that there are certain ambiguities appearing on the face of the lease instrument. Lest there be any doubt as to our holding, we expressly state that we are not implicitly applying the \"plain meaning rule.\" Whether or not ambiguity is apparent from the face of a contract, evidence of the circumstances of the making of the contract is admissible. We reject the plain meaning rule and expressly adopt the context rule as the applicable rule for ascertaining the parties' intent and interpreting written contracts.\nThe trial court is reversed and the matter remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nCallow, C.J., and Utter, Dolliver, Dore, Andersen, Durham, Smith, and Guy, JJ., concur.\nThe Court of Appeals erred. First, there was no evidence in the record by affidavit or otherwise of the intent of the drafter of the lease. Second, the intent of the drafter of a document is not relevant unless it expresses the intent of the parties.",

            "text": "Neill, J.\nPlaintiff landlord brings an action for rents accrued under a lease. Defendant tenant (assignee of original lessee) appeals from a judgment awarding plaintiff the full rentals, contending (1) that there had been a constructive eviction; (2) that he had surrendered the premises and plaintiff has accepted such surrender; and (3) that any liability for rentals is limited to $850 by the terms of a liquidated damages provision of the lease.\nNo error is assigned to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and they are accepted as the verities on this appeal. Riley v. Rhay, 76 Wn.2d 32, 454 P.2d 820 (1969). From these findings and the supporting record, the following relevant facts emerge.\nThe plaintiff leased gasoline service station premises in Seattle to Harris Petroleum Co. The lease was executed in March of 1957 for a term of 10 years, with rental of $425 per month reserved. The lease agreement acknowledged a deposit of $850\nas security for the faithful performance by Lessee of all the terms and conditions of this lease . . . which deposit shall be applied upon the last two (2) months rental [if the lessee performs, or] . . . shall be retained by Lessor as liquidated damages in the event Lessee fails to so perform.\nIn September of 1962, by assignment and with the lessor\u2019s consent, defendant succeeded to the position of tenant under this lease agreement.\nIn 1959, 3 years before defendant became the tenant, Harris Petroleum had complained to plaintiff that automobiles of plaintiff\u2019s adjacent used car lot were being parked in such manner as to interfere with access to the service station. No further complaints appear to have been made by either Harris Petroleum or defendant, and each respective tenant continued to pay the reserved rent and occupy the premises until they were vacated and abandoned by defendant. Customer access to the service station has been continuously available.\nWhen station operations proved to be unprofitable, defendant investigated the possibility of remodeling, but this proved to be impracticable. Then, in November of 1964, defendant informed plaintiff that it was \u201ccancelling\u201d the lease. One reason advanced for this was that the premises were no longer suitable for use as a gasoline station. As an explanation, or as a separate reason for vacating, defendant stated that businesses which had been located on adjoining property when the lease term commenced were no longer in operation. (We observe from the record that these other businesses had left before defendant took the lease assignment from Harris Petroleum and that this was known to defendant at that time.)\nPlaintiff responded through his attorneys in a letter dated November 16, 1964: \u201cNotice is hereby given that the lessor will insist upon the terms of the. lease and does not concur in the cancellation attempted by Petroleum Products.\u201d This intent to insist upon the tenant\u2019s performance is further reflected in subsequent letters of December 11, 1964, (\u201cMr. Pague does not recognize your right to terminate the lease.\u201d) and January 4, 1965 (\u201cMr. Pague is insisting upon your carrying out this lease.\u201d). There was neither vagueness nor equivocation in plaintiff\u2019s expressions of intent.\nFollowing defendant\u2019s abandonment of the premises, plaintiff made reasonable and good-faith attempts to rerent or sell the premises, but without avail. During that time, plaintiff did park some of the automobiles from the adjacent used car lot upon a portion of the premises, but neither the duration, the extent, nor the value of this use was established by evidence.\nUpon these facts, the trial court concluded that a lease existed between plaintiff and defendant; that the landlord had made a good-faith attempt to rerent the premises; and that accrued rental to the time of the trial was due in the sum of $11,475, plus interest. Judgment was entered accordingly.\nThe facts do not support the defendant\u2019s contention that it was evicted. In order for a vacating tenant to claim constructive eviction, it is essential that he give the landlord notice of the act or condition complained of and an opportunity to remove or correct the condition. California Bldg. Co. v. Drury, 103 Wash. 577, 175 P. 302 (1918); Erickson v. Elliott, 177 Wash. 229, 31 P.2d 506 (1934). Further, there is no eviction where, as here, the only complaint was made long before the vacating of the premises \u00a1and the tenant has continued in occupancy and to pay rent without further or continuing complaint. California Bldg. Co. v. Drury, supra. The record reveals only a single instance of complaint to the landlord, and this was not by the defendant, but by his predecessor. It was made 3 years before the assignment and 5 years before defendant abandoned the premises.\nDefendant next contends that its abandonment was transformed into a surrender and acceptance by the landlord\u2019s subsequent use of the premises in connection with his used car operation, or, in the alternative, that the reasonable value of this use should be credited against the amount due for rentals.\nWhen a tenant has wrongfully abandoned his leasehold, he cannot thereafter designate any subsequent occupation or control of the premises by his landlord as a surrender and acceptance. In such cases, the subsequent use by the landlord must be substantial enough to evidence a reappropriation of the premises and an intent on his part to foreclose any future rights of the tenant in the premises. There is no evidence to establish the duration, extent or value of the landlord\u2019s subsequent use of the premises. This failure to produce evidence on value, duration and extent is fatal to the defendant\u2019s contention. The burden is on the party claiming credit to put in evidence as to amount. The tenant failed so to do.\nDefendant\u2019s final contention is that, in any event, the amount recoverable by the plaintiff is limited to $850 by the terms of the lease agreement. The relevant provisions read:\nThe Lessee has paid to and the Lessor acknowledges receipt of the sum of Eight Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($850.00) as security for the faithful performance by Lessee of all the terms and conditions of this lease to be performed by Lessee, which deposit shall be applied upon the last two (2) months rental of the aforesaid term in the event of such performance by the Lessee; and which deposit shall be retained by Lessor as liquidated damages in the event Lessee fails to so perform.\nIf the Lessee shall fail to keep and perform any of the covenants and agreements herein contained, then Lessor may cancel this lease upon giving the notice required by law and re-enter said premises, retaining the sum deposited as security herewith as liquidated damages.\nFor present purposes, it will be assumed that the above language constitutes a liquidated damages clause.\nWe first observe that a landlord is not ordinarily precluded from his right to rentals reserved under a lease by the tenant\u2019s act of wrongful abandonment. As we observed in the case of Brown v. Hayes, 92 Wash. 300, 302, 159 P. 89 (1916):\n[Wjhen a tenant abandons the premises without just cause and refuses to pay rent, the landlord may either treat the term as still subsisting and sue for the installments of rent reserved as they accrue; or, treating the lease as terminated by the tenant\u2019s breach, reenter and sue for damages for the breach.\nAccord, 3A Thompson, Real Property \u00a7 1306 (1959).\nWrongful abandonment by a tenant presents the landlord with alternative remedies. He may choose to terminate the lease and sue for damages. Benjamin Franklin Thrift Stores v. Jared, 192 Wash. 252, 73 P.2d 525 (1937); Mon Wai v. Parks, 43 Wn.2d 562, 262 P.2d 196 (1953). As we have already noted, the plaintiff took no action following defendant\u2019s abandonment which indicated an intent to terminate the lease term. To the contrary, express declarations show a clear and unwavering intent to elect to treat the lease term as subsisting and sue for rent. Of course, a person\u2019s declarations may be belied by his actions, but defendant has not shown such contrary conduct by the plaintiff.\nThe lessee contends that the above quoted language in the lease not only limits the amount recoverable should the lessor elect to treat the lease as terminated and sue for damages, but also precludes the lessor from electing the alternative remedy of an action for rent reserved.\nThe language of the lease does not specifically tie the liquidated damages clause to a breach of the covenant to pay rent. We also note that the lease agreement does not expressly limit the landlord to an action for damages upon a breach of the agreement. The language used states that the lessor may cancel the lease if the lessee fails to perform. This language gives no indication that the parties intended to eliminate a possible remedy. Under these circumstances we will not infer such an intent.\nTo hold, as defendant urges, that a general liquidated damages clause not only limits the amount recoverable in an action for damages but also compels the lessor to seek his remedy in damages would be to hold that this court will choose between two possible inferences the one which denies a remedy to the innocent party. We 'are unwilling to create such a rule.\nDefendant cites and relies on several of our prior cases as support for his position that plaintiff is limited to an action for damages. We have, already pointed out that Benjamin Franklin Thrift Stores v. Jared, supra, and Mon Waiv. Parks, supra, are cases wherein the landlord elected to terminate the lease, thus limiting his remedy to an action for damages. These cases do not stand for the proposition that the landlord could not recover for accruing rents if the lease were subsisting.\nThe case of Pacific & Puget Sound Bottling Co. v. Clithero, 162 Wash. 156, 298 P. 316 (1931), is not applicable to this situation. There, the landlord brought an action to terminate the lease and recover accrued rents. A liquidated damages provision in that lease was expressly made applicable to a default in the payment of rents. We held that the landlord was foreclosed from a recovery of rentals beyond the liquidated amount stipulated in the lease. We did not there hold that that lease provision for liquidated damages eliminated the landlord\u2019s right to treat the term as continuing and sue for rents accruing after the tenant\u2019s breach. That question was not before us. Neither did we hold that, should a landlord elect to terminate a lease and sue for damages, a general liquidated damages provision which neither, expressly nor impliedly limited the amount recoverable for a breach of the covenant to pay rent would be applicable. The crucial factor in that case was the clear application of the liquidated damages clause under consideration to the 'amount recoverable in an action for damages for breach of the covenant to pay rent. The landlord was bringing just such an action.\nThe case of Oldfield v. Angeles Brewing & Malting Co., 62 Wash. 260, 113 P. 630 (1911), is also distinguishable as it involved an agreement to enter tenancy. In such situations, the parties do not occupy the relationship of landlord and tenant, but are parties to a separate and independent contract.\n1 Tiffany, Real Property \u00a7 76 at 113 (3d ed. 1939):\nThe words \u201ctenant\u201d and \u201clessee\u201d are frequently used by the courts with considerable looseness, as if equivalent in meaning. The word \u201clessee\u201d should however be applied only to the person to whom the lease is originally made, while the word \u201ctenant\u201d is applicable to 'any person who holds possession under a lease, whether the original lessee or the latter\u2019s assignee. A lessee, provided he has entered under the lease, is necessarily a tenant, but a tenant is not necessarily a lessee . . .24\n24 An illustration of the importance of this distinction is where one executes an instrument of lease and does not enter under it. In such case, while he is a lessee, he has never become a tenant. As one consequence, termination of the lease by the lessor does not constitute eviction, and his liability to the lessor is, in such case, for damages and not for rent.\nOldfield is in accordance with this distinction as the lessee had refused to take possession of the premises. See 32 Am. Jur. Landlord & Tenant \u00a7 27 (1941); 3 Thompson, Real Property \u00a7 1031, at 96 (1959).\nIn Oldfield, the plaintiff could not avail himself of the election of remedies which our law gives to a landlord because he did not occupy that position. That case is not authority for the contention made here that one who is in a position of landlord can be denied his election of remedies by a general liquidated damages clause.\nThis case does not raise an issue as to whether the amount recoverable in an action for rent should be affected by a rule corollary to the rule of mitigation of damages, since it is clear from this record that the landlord made every reasonable effort to relet or sell the premises. See Wright v. Baumann, 239 Ore. 410, 398 P.2d 119 (1965), 21 A.L.R.3d 527 (1968); Annot., 21 A.L.R.3d 534 (1968); Martin v. Siegley, 123 Wash. 683, 212 P. 1057 (1923). Neither are we here concerned with the effect of the landlord\u2019s subsequent use of a part of the premises, since the extent, duration and value, if any, of this use has not been shown.\nJudgment affirmed.\nHunter, C.

            "text": "Blake, C. J.\nThe plaintiffs are the owners of a hotel\u2014building and furnishings\u2014in Harrington. They leased the property to the defendants for a five-year term beginning May 15, 1937, at a monthly rental of fifty dollars, payable in advance on the fifteenth day of each month of the term. The defendants covenanted \u201cto pay . . . the . . . rent in the manner . . . specified.\u201d They defaulted, however, in the payment of the installment of rent due on October 15, 1938.\nSubsequent to that date, they were notified by the lessors to pay the rent within ten days or surrender possession. The defendants did neither. On November 10th, they were served with notice of forfeiture of the lease. In December, this action was commenced for possession of the property and damages.\nThe defendants answered, alleging that they were not in default. This defense rested on two theories: (1) That, by reason of past indulgences on the part of the lessors with respect to the time of payments, the lease was not subject to forfeiture until a reasonable time had elapsed after notice to pay; (2) that the lessees had been compelled to make repairs which the plaintiffs had covenanted by the terms of the lease to make, and that the cost of these repairs exceeded the amount due.\nThe cause came on for trial in March, 1939, with defendants still in possession of the property. After hearing the evidence, the trial court found that the plaintiffs had fulfilled their covenant to make repairs, and that the defendants were in default in payment of rent from October 15, 1938. Judgment was entered awarding the plaintiffs immediate possession of the property and two hundred and fifty dollars damages for wrongful possession by defendants subsequent to the notice of forfeiture and demand for possession served on them on November 10th. The defendants appeal.\nAppellants first contend that the action cannot be maintained because of failure of respondents to bring themselves within the provisions of the unlawful detainer statutes, Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 812 [P. C. \u00a7 7970] et seq. The remedy afforded by that act, however, is not exclusive. Upon allegations of the lessee\u2019s default and wrongful possession, a landlord may still maintain an action in ejectment. Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 785 [P. C. \u00a7 7517]; Gustin v. Klingenberg, 190 Wash. 590, 70 P. (2d) 308; Warvelle on Ejectment, \u00a7\u00a7 150 and 151.\nThe next contention made is based on the first theory of appellants\u2019 defense: That respondents, having in the past granted indulgences with respect to the time of payments of rent, could not claim a forfeiture without giving appellants a reasonable time after notice to pay the rent due on October 15th. In support of this contention, appellants cite a line of cases holding that a vendor, having waived strict compliance with an \u201cessence of time\u201d clause in the contract, cannot claim a forfeiture without giving the vendee a reasonable time to perform.\nThe principle of those cases is not applicable to an action in ejectment brought by a landlord against a tenant for default in payment of rent. Under Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 785, a demand for the payment of the rent in arrears was the only condition precedent to maintenance of the action. See Carlson v. Curran, 42 Wash. 647, 85 Pac. 627, 6 L. R. A. (N. S.) 260; Lewiston Water & Power Co. v. Brown, 42 Wash. 555, 85 Pac. 47; Warvelle on Ejectment, \u00a7 149 et seq.; 2 Tiffany, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 194, subd. f.\nAppellants\u2019 final contention rests upon the principle that, in an action for rent, a tenant may recoup on account of expenditures incurred in making repairs which the landlord covenanted to make. Tipton v. Roberts, 48 Wash. 391, 93 Pac. 906; Income Properties Inv. Corp. v. Trefethen, 155 Wash. 493, 284 Pac. 782. Respondents covenanted \u201cto repair and keep roof in good condition. Also agree to have a return system put on the heating plant.\u201d\nWhether respondents had performed these covenants was the principal issue in controversy and the one to which practically all of the evidence was directed. The trial court found:\n\u201c. . . that the plaintiffs placed a new roof on the building and have at all times kept the same in repair and in good condition, . . .\n\u201c. . . that the plaintiffs did put in a return system on the heating plant, and have complied with the terms of the lease in that respect.\u201d\nThe finding with respect to the roof is, to our minds, supported by an overwhelming preponderance of evidence.\nWhere the weight of the evidence rests with respect to the heating plant, is not so clear. That respondents made a good-faith attempt to carry out their covenant, there can be no doubt. In September, 1937, they spent approximately three hundred dollars to install what was represented to be a \u201creturn system.\u201d That it was not adequate, is admitted. In December of that year, respondents put in two hundred dollars more on a return system. Whether this installation was \u201ca return system,\u201d there is a contrariety of opinion among the experts\u2014some saying it was and some saying not. That the guests found trouble in keeping warm, there is no doubt. But again there is dispute as to whether their plight was due to inadequacy of the system or over-economy in firing.\nThe evidence is so evenly divided on these points that we are unable to say that it preponderates either way. Consequently we must accept the finding of the trial court on the issue. Columbus Varnish Co. v. Seattle Paint Co., 77 Wash. 245, 137 Pac. 434.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMillard, Main, Robinson, and Simpson, JJ., concur.",

            "text": "Hill, J.\nA seven-and-one-half-year farm tenancy having expired, the owners of the property,' hereinafter called the landlord, sued the former tenant, hereinafter called the tenant, for damages because of the condition in which the farm was left and the removal or destruction of certain property, all of which constituted breaches of certain covenants in the lease. The tenant cross-complained and asked for damages to his hay, occasioned by the failure of the landlord to keep the roof of the barn in repair.\nThe trial court found for the landlord on numerous items of damage ranging from $15 to $250 and aggregating $1,261, and found against the tenant on his cross-complaint.\nThe tenant appeals, making twelve assignments of error, ten of the first eleven challenging the sufficiency of the evidence on various items of damage, either as to the fact of damage or the amount thereof, or both. The twelfth assignment of error challenges the failure of the court to award him judgment on his cross-complaint.\nA discussion of each assignment of error would involve a detailing of the evidence on each item of damage and take several pages of our reports and be of interest to no one unless it be the litigants. We will content ourselves with the statement that, although the evidence is frequently in conflict, it is sufficient to sustain every finding of fact by the trial court.\nOn only four of the twelve assignments of error are there any citations of authority, and the law points involved are relatively few and simple. One somewhat novel argument relates to the destruction of a small orchard. The tenant urges that, since the land is worth more for dairy purposes than it was as an orchard, there can be no damage. This overlooks that fact that the landlord owns the premises and was entitled to have an orchard if he wanted it, or, as we said in Park v. Northport Smelting & Refining Co., 47 Wash. 597, 92 Pac. 442, \u201che is entitled to the benefit of his property intact.\u201d We pointed out in that case that where a part of the real property is destroyed, the loss may be estimated upon the dimunition in the value of the premises, if any results, or upon the value of the part severed or destroyed; and that the measure of damages should be adopted which would prove most beneficial to the injured party. The judgment for $75 for the destruction of the orchard was well within the evidence.\nThe one assignment of error among the first eleven that does not concern itself with the fact or the amount of damage as to certain items is No. 8, which raises a question as to whether title to certain articles had passed to the tenant by a bill of sale. It is there urged that a hot water heater, gas pump and mailbox which had been installed by the landlord prior to the tenancy and had been removed by the tenant, were equipment within the terms of a bill of sale from the landlord to the tenant covering \u201cAll cattle, horses, feed, seed, farm machinery and equipment, delivery trucks, and retail routes,\u201d which was executed at the time the parties entered into the lease. The tenant cites cases to the effect that the parol evidence rule is a rule of substantive law, with which we agree; but no parol evidence was necessary to indicate to any fair-minded man that the bill of sale was not intended to convey items so obviously fixtures (as between landlord and tenant) as the hot water heater, the gas pump and the mailbox. Nor do we see any basis for the tenant\u2019s contention that the bill of sale so clearly covered the furniture, dishes and utensils that it was a violation of the parol evidence rule to show that they were not intended to be conveyed by it.\nNeither is there any substance to the claim that, if the water heater was converted by the tenant to his own use, it was done in 1940 or 1941, and that, therefore, the action for damages on that item was barred by the statute of limitations. The landlord would have no reason to believe that the water heater would not be returned tvhen the lease expired, and his cause of action for the breach of covenant to \u201creturn the premises to the lessors in as good condition as received or better\u201d did not mature until the termination of the lease in 1947. 32 Am. Jur. 693, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 815. The action was commenced in 1948 and was therefore not barred by any statute of limitations.\nThat the tenant had some hay damaged as the result of a leaking roof is established; there is also evidence that the landlord made all repairs as quickly as could reasonably be expected after the necessity therefor was reported to him. We have recently had occasion to point out that, before a lessee can recover damages from a lessor for breach of a covenant to keep in repair, he must establish timely notice to the lessor of the need for repairs and that the lessor failed to make them within a reasonable time under the circumstances. Franklin v. Fischer, 34 Wn. (2d) 342, 208 P. (2d) 902, and authorities there cited.\nAs previously indicated, it seems to us that there is evidence supporting every finding of fact made by the trial court and that it drew the proper conclusions of law therefrom. There being no reason to disturb any part of the judgment, it is affirmed in its entirety.\nSimpson, C. J., Robinson, Mallery, and Hamley, JJ., concur.",

            "text": "Hill, J.\nThis action was brought under the Federal housing and rent act of 1947 as amended (50 U.S.C.A. Appendix, \u00a7\u00a7 1881-1884, 1891-1906) and the regulations issued thereunder, to recover three times the amount of certain rental overcharges, to secure the return of a lease deposit in the amount of one hundred sixty dollars, and for an attorney\u2019s fee of two hundred dollars. An action of this character can be maintained against the person who \u201cretains\u201d any payment of rent in excess of the maximum prescribed. 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix, \u00a7 1895.\nThe overcharges amounted to twenty dollars a month for twelve months (two hundred forty dollars) and were not seriously contested.\nThe overcharge being established, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover three times the amount thereof unless the defendants proved that the overcharge, or the retention thereof, was neither willful nor the result of failure to take \u201cpracticable precautions\u201d against the occurrence thereof. Shuh v. Oakes (1951), 38 Wn. (2d) 336, 229 P. (2d) 507.\nThe defendants urge that the overcharge and the retention thereof were not willful and the damages should not be trebled; and that the plaintiffs committed waste and damaged the premises in five particulars, to the property owners\u2019 damage in the amount of $362.78. The defendants\u2019 claims about the condition in which the plaintiffs left the property when they surrendered possession are particularly important, not only on the issue of damages, but also on the issue of justification of the defendants\u2019 failure to reimburse the plaintiffs for the overcharges in accordance with the order relating thereto.\nThe defendants, as lessors, and the plaintiffs, as lessees, entered into a lease for a period of three years from August 10, 1950, covering a dwelling house known as 4736-% University way, in Seattle. We quote the following provision from the lease, inasmuch as the right to the last two months\u2019 rent, which was paid in advance, is one of the issues in the case: \u201cReceipt is hereby acknowledged of Two Hundred and forty dollars, being the first and last two months [rent].\u201d\nThe plaintiffs remained in possession until September 20, 1951, paying the rent for each month except the month of September, 1951. When it became necessary for them to move from Seattle, they asked and received permission to sublease the premises but were unsuccessful in their efforts so to do. Mr. Largent then agreed to release them from their obligations under the lease and to accept surrender of the premises, but refused to return any part of the last two months\u2019 rental that had been paid in advance. He immediately rented the premises, effective October 1, 1951, to another tenant, also at the rate of eighty dollars a month.\nMr. Largent, a real-estate broker of many years\u2019 experience (but retired when the case was tried), had registered all of his property used for dwelling purposes when the act in question became effective in the Seattle area. He had not registered the premises at 4736-% University way at that time because they were then rented as business property. He testified that he \u201coverlooked\u201d registering the property when he leased it to the plaintiffs as a dwelling in August, 1950; nor did he register it during the period of their occupancy. He first registered the property on October 16, 1951, giving the name of the then-tenant, R. Salonen, and indicating that it was first rented on October 1,1951, thus failing to disclose the prior lease to the plaintiffs and their occupancy of the premises as a dwelling for more than thirteen months. This, together with his extensive experience as a real-estate broker, was unquestionably a factor in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that he had acted willfully in failing to register the premises as he should have done in August, 1950.\nOn May 29, 1952, the area rental director issued an order fixing the maximum rental of the premises at sixty dollars a month, effective as of September 10, 1950, and directing the refund, within thirty days, of any rent collected in excess of that amount. On June 2, 1952, Mr. Largent wrote the plaintiffs expressing his willingness to make reimbursement for the rental overcharges but asserting that the plaintiffs owed him a considerable amount for damages to the premises and the expenses he had incurred in making the place habitable again, and suggesting that they or their attorney discuss the matter with him or his attorney. The plaintiffs elected to discuss the matter in court, and commenced this action July 22, 1952.\nThe one item of damage to the defendants\u2019 property conceded by the plaintiffs was \u201cabout a dozen dart holes\u201d in a bedroom door. No evidence was offered as to the amount of the damage to the door.\nThe defendants failed to call as a witness the person to whom Mr. Largent testified he had paid sixty-five dollars for cleaning the premises and who should have been in a position to corroborate Mr. Largent\u2019s testimony as to the claimed deplorable condition of the premises when the plaintiffs surrendered possession. The defendants were, therefore, in no position to complain when the trial court elected to believe the plaintiffs instead of Mr. Largent and found against the defendants on each of the five items of damage alleged in their cross-complaint. The trial court concluded that the defendants\u2019 urging of those items of damage as the basis for the adjustment of the rental overcharges was \u201cspecious and unfounded.\u201d\nWith some travail of mind and spirit, we have recognized that our courts have no discretion in the matter of entertaining actions for damages under the Federal statutes with which we are here concerned, and little discretion in the consideration of treble damages when an overcharge is established. Walker v. Gilman (1946), 25 Wn. (2d) 557, 171 P. (2d) 797. Being convinced that Mr. Largent\u2019s failure to register the premises was willful, and that his excuses for not refunding the amount of the overcharges as directed were \u201cspecious and unfounded,\u201d the trial court was obligated to award treble damages. Shuh v. Oakes, supra; Walker v. Gilman, supra; Gutman v. Lawton Estates (1952), 102 F. Supp. 724.\nTo this point, the issues seem- purely factual. The right of the lessors to retain the rent paid in advance, even though they consented to a termination of the lease, presents a legal question.\nThe general rule is that the right and title to advance rentals passes to the lessor on .the payment thereof, and the lessee can derive further benefit therefrom only by occupying the premises during the period or which the rent is paid. Sanders v. General Petroleum Corp. (1933), 171 Wash. 250,17 P. (2d) 890; General Petroleum Corp. v. Harry Wright\u2019s, Inc. (1932), 166 Wash. 636, 8 P. (2d) 291, 13 P. (2d) 1080; Rockwell v. Eiler\u2019s Music House (1912), 67 Wash. 478, 122 Pac. 12, 39 L. R. A. (N.S.) 894; Dutton v. Christie (1911), 63 Wash. 372, 115 Pac. 856.\nThe plaintiffs, in support of their contention that one hundred dollars (the one hundred sixty dollars paid at the time the lease was executed, for the last two months\u2019 rental under the lease, less the sixty dollars the plaintiffs owed the defendants for the September, 1951, rental) should be returned to them, cite Stern v. Green (1923), 127 Wash. 429, 221 Pac. 601. That is a lease-deposit case, and there is a \u201cmanifest difference\u201d between a lease deposit and a payment of rental in advance. See Dutton v. Christie, supra.\nUnfortunately for the defendants, however, they could not \u201cdemand, receive or retain\u201d any \u201cprepayment of rent except payment in advance of the next periodic installment of rent for a period ... no longer than one month.\u201d This is by reason of a regulation adopted under the Federal housing and rent act of 1947 as amended. 24 C. F. R. (1949 ed.) \u00a7 825.2(c). (Plaintiffs referred to 16 Fed. Reg. 12882, \u00a7 73, dated December 22, 1951. Not liking ex post facto regulations, we checked further and found the same regulation, cited above, in effect on August 10, 1950.)\nWe are of the opinion that the trial court did not err in crediting to the rental due for September, 1951, sixty of the one hundred sixty dollars paid in advance by the plaintiffs, and in giving the plaintiffs judgment for the remaining one hundred dollars.\nThe trial court allowed two hundred fifty dollars for the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2019s fee. We agree with the defendants that the allowance for that purpose should be reduced to two hundred dollars, that being the amount prayed for in the complaint. The plaintiffs place emphasis upon the fact that the attorney for the defendants agreed that the court might fix the attorney\u2019s fee if the plaintiffs were entitled to recover one. However, such an agreement was to avoid the necessity of calling witnesses on the issue of the amount of the fee, and the concession by the attorney for the defendants was unquestionably limited to the amount prayed for in the complaint.\nThe plaintiffs ask for additional attorney\u2019s fees in this court and point out that 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix, \u00a7 1895, provides that the person making an overcharge shall be liable to the person from whom the overcharge is received or retained \u201cfor reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs as determined by the court\u201d (italics ours), in addition to three times the amount of the overcharge.\nOur construction of the language used would limit \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d to those fixed by the trial court. It has been our policy not to fix attorneys\u2019 fees for services in this court, even under statutes much more explicit than that now under consideration. See Franklin v. Fischer (1949), 34 Wn. (2d) 342, 208 P. (2d) 902; Flint v. Bronson (1939), 197 Wash. 686, 86 P. (2d) 218. However, several Federal courts and a few state courts have held to the contrary. It is conceded that the determination of additional \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d for services in this court is discretionary. We shall exercise that discretion rather than engage in a dialectical discussion of what courts Congress had in mind when it used the phrase \u201cdetermined by the court.\u201d\nUnder all of the circumstances of the case, we are of the view that additional attorney\u2019s fees are not warranted for the services rendered in this court, other than the statutory attorney\u2019s fee allowed to the prevailing party. See Griffith v. Norman (1948), 170 F. (2d) 745.\nThe judgment is affirmed as to the award of treble the amount of the overcharges, as is the dismissal with prejudice of the defendants\u2019 cross-appeal. As to the award of one hundred dollars, reimbursement for advance rentals, the judgment is likewise affirmed. As to the allowance for an attorney\u2019s fee in the superior court, the judgment is reduced from two hundred fifty to two hundred dollars.\nThe respondents, having prevailed on the major issues on this appeal, will recover their costs.\nHamley, C.

            "text": "Hill, C. J.\nThe issue presented is whether a tenant has made a prima facie case against his landlord in an action for personal injuries and property damage, occasioned by the breaking of a large store-front, plate glass window. The trial court granted a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, and entered an order of dismissal. The plaintiff appeals. We shall hereafter refer to the parties as the tenant and the landlord.\nThe tenant paid two hundred dollars to the agent of the landlord on November 26, 1955, as rent for the month of December, 1955. This was for additional store space, which -the tenant, a florist, needed for the Christmas season. He took possession immediately after paying the rent and before the 1st of December.\nThe dangerous condition of the window (the glass was detached from its frame at one of the top corners and left an opening of approximately three inches) was discovered by an employee of the tenant when he started to wash the window, and was reported to an agent of the landlord by the tenant.\nThere is likewise no dispute that an agent of the landlord, some time around December the 1st or 2nd, promised to have the condition repaired; whatever the date, it was after the lease was entered into, the rent paid, and possession taken.\nA glass company was requested by the landlord\u2019s agent to do whatever was required, -but on December the 6th, before anything was done, a strong wind blew the glass out with resulting damage to the property of the tenant and injury to his person, which occurred while he was endeavoring to minimize the property damage.\nThe tenant concedes that the general rule is that a landlord is not responsible for injuries to a tenant from defects which are actually known to the tenant. He urges, however, that he comes within certain exceptions to the general rule, and that he established a prima facie case (1) for breach of contract, and (2) in tort.\nWe do not agree with either contention, and conclude that the trial court was right in dismissing the action.\nThe plaintiff fails on his contract theory, because there was no covenant to keep in repair, and no evidence of any agreement to make the specific repairs involving the window prior to or at the time the lease was made. The discovery of the dangerous condition of the window did not occur until after the lease was made and the tenant had gone into possession. (This circumstance distinguishes Johnson v. Dye (1924), 131 Wash. 637, 230 Pac. 625, on which the tenant relies.)\nIt follows that there was no contractual obligation on the landlord to make the repairs; that the tenant took the premises as he found them, and there was no implied warranty by the landlord that they were safe or fit for the purpose for which they were rented. Miller v. Vance Lbr. Co. (1932), 167 Wash. 348, 9 P. (2d) 351. (In the case of Stoops v. Carlisle-Pennell Lbr. Co. (1923), 127 Wash. 82, 219 Pac. 876, also relied on by the tenant, this court declined to pass on the issue of whether such a gratuitous promise to make repairs could give rise to liability against the landlord, but we thereafter met that issue squarely in Miller v. Vance Lbr. Co., supra.)\nNor is this a case where a tenant threatens to terminate a lease unless certain repairs are made and remains in possession because of a promise to repair.\nThere is no evidence of any consideration for the landlord\u2019s promise to have the necessary repairs made to the window, and no liability attached by reason of his failure so to do. Miller v. Vance Lbr. Co., supra.\nAs indicated in the Miller case, the landlord is at liberty to repudiate, or to perform, such a promise. If he elected to perform it, then he would be liable for the manner of performance. Here, it is clear, we are concerned with a delay to perform a promise for which there was no consideration, and we are not concerned with any negligence or want of care in the manner of performance.\nThe plaintiff fails also on his tort theory.\nThere could be tort liability on the part of the landlord for a defect in the premises only if it was known, or should have been known, to the landlord, and not known to the tenant at the time the tenancy agreement was entered into. In Miller v. Vance Lbr. Co., supra, we quoted the following language from Mesher v. Osborne (1913), 75 Wash. 439, 447, 134 Pac. 1092, 48 L. R. A. (N.S.) 917,\n\u201cTo the general rule of the landlord\u2019s nonliability for injury from defects, there is. the well recognized exception that, even in the absence of warranty or express agreement by the landlord to repair, he is liable to the tenant or the tenant\u2019s guest as for a tort, where, with actual knowledge of obscure defects or dangers at the time of the letting, he lets the premises without disclosing such defects to a tenant who does not know, and by the exercise of reasonable care would not discover, them. The duty to disclose such latent defects and dangers when actually known to the landlord exists without regard to any covenant or lack of covenant to repair. But in the absence of such covenant, there is no duty of inspection on the landlord\u2019s part to discover latent and unknown defects.\u201d\nThere is no evidence in this case that the landlord had any knowledge that the window was in a dangerous condition until it was called to the attention of his agent by the tenant; and, as indicated in the foregoing quotation, in the absence of a covenant to repair there was no duty of inspection on the landlord\u2019s part to discover latent and unknown defects.\nThe plaintiff has endeavored to bring himself within the ambit of the cases which relieve a tenant, during a reasonable period of time for the making of repairs by the landlord, from the defense of assumption of risk. Assumption of risk by the tenant does not become an issue until a duty to repair on the part of the landlord is established. The trial court concluded, and we agree, that no such duty was established.\nThe judgment of dismissal is affirmed.\nDonworth, Weaver, Rosellini, and Foster, JJ., concur.",

            "text": "Hicks, J.\nLessor, Washington Hydroculture, Inc., brought a damage action against lessee, Frank Payne, for the cost of rebuilding two leased fiberglass greenhouses destroyed by fire. Summary judgment on liability was granted against lessee based on a provision in the lease commonly called a maintenance and delivery clause. There is no issue of fault, as this is an action on the contract.\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court. Washington Hydroculture, Inc. v. Payne, 26 Wn. App. 40, 610 P.2d 967 (1980). We reverse.\nIn 1975, Frank Payne leased two hydroponic greenhouses located on lessor's property from Washington Hydroculture, Inc. These greenhouses were over 120 feet long and about 26 feet wide and appear to have been affixed to the ground by some sort of foundation. The lease contained a general, unqualified, maintenance and delivery clause as follows:\nDuring the term of this lease, lessee shall maintain said [greenhouses]; and, upon expiration of the term hereof surrender in as good a condition as it shall be when lessee takes possession thereof, except for ordinary wear and tear.\nThe lease was prepared by lessor and, according to lessee's affidavit on the motion for summary judgment, was \"not negotiated by the parties\" nor did the parties ever discuss \"prior to execution of the lease, the risk of loss caused by fire.\"\nThe trial court did not inquire into fault and lessor admits that fault was unalleged and not at issue. The trial court denied lessee's motion for summary judgment and granted lessor's. The trial on damages resulted in an award of $23,780.72 to lessor.\nThere was no clause in the lease requiring lessee to insure the premises, however, lessee did have insurance on the contents. The insurance proceeds paid to lessee on the contents are almost the same amount as the amount awarded to lessor by the trial court.\nThe issue in this case is whether we should retain the rule requiring a tenant, regardless of fault, to rebuild leased premises destroyed by fire, where the tenant has entered into a lease containing a general maintenance and delivery clause with no exceptions other than normal wear and tear.\nPetitioner/lessee asserts that the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case conflicts with our decisional law, specifically with Anderson v. Ferguson, 17 Wn.2d 262, 135 P.2d 302 (1943) and United Mut. Sav. Bank v. Riebli, 55 Wn.2d 816, 350 P.2d 651 (1960). Respondent/lessor asserts that the decision of the trial court and the Court of Appeals in this case is in accord with the common law rule, still effective in this and some other jurisdictions. Respondent/ lessor also relies primarily on Anderson for its position. This confusion can be attributed to a harsh and outdated rule, the effects of which we have in the past attempted to avoid by reasoning around rather than changing.\nThere can be no dispute that the common law rule, and our early rule, was as stated by the Court of Appeals at page 42 in its opinion on this case:\nThus, it appears to be the settled law in this state that an unconditional or unqualified covenant on the part of the lessee to maintain and keep premises leased by him in good repair or in as good condition as that existing at the time specified in the lease, and to return the premises at the expiration or termination of the lease in such equivalent condition, obligates the lessee to rebuild in case the buildings leased are destroyed by fire or other casualty during the term.\nQuoting from Anderson v. Ferguson, supra at 270-71.\nOne of the earliest cases to apply the rule in Washington was Armstrong v. Maybee, 17 Wash. 24, 48 P. 737 (1897), where plaintiff/lessor brought action against a lessee for breach of a covenant in a lease covering a shingle mill, house, office, machinery, and office fixtures, all destroyed by fire during the course of the lease. The covenant in that lease was worded as follows:\nlessee shall maintain all of the machinery and buildings ... in as good condition and repair as the same now are in and return the same ... in as good condition as the same Eire now in, reasonable wear and tear from ordinary use alone excepted.\"\n17 Wash, at 25.\nThe use of the word \"alone\" in the Armstrong lease favors the construction placed on it by the court, holding the lessee liable to rebuild. The Armstrong court's analysis of authorities and decisionEil law indicates that the slightest variation in wording can make the difference between the loss falling on the lessor or the lessee. The court intends to uphold the intent of the parties, as was stated in Armstrong (quoting from a Michigan opinion):\n\"In construing the covenants in a lease the cardinal rule is that the intention of the parties shall govern; and the courts will not extend or enlarge the obligation of the lessee beyond the plain meaning of the language used and the intention existing at the time it was made; and if there is not an express stipulation to the effect to restore buildings and other property leased, destroyed by casualties from fire or water, without fault or neglect on the psirt of the tenant, the loss must fall upon the landlord\n17 Wash, at 28-29.\nThe court went on to hold against lessee, stating that in the case at bar we are unable, from any fair reading of the whole lease, to find any doubtful language or anything in the circumstances of the parties which would require other than one construction of the language used.\n17 Wash, at 29.\nIn Anderson v. Ferguson, 17 Wn.2d 262, 135 P.2d 302 (1943), we approved the rule but avoided applying it, stating that the phraseology of the covenant to repair and deliver in that case, as compared to the language used in the particular lease under consideration in Armstrong, was different. The language of the covenant was as follows:\n\"The said lessee . . . agrees to quit and deliver up the premises ... at the end of the term, in as good order, condition and repair as the reasonable use and wear thereof will permit. ...\"\n17 Wn.2d at 264. The court found the above language did not require by its terms that the lessee maintain or keep the premises in any particular condition whatever during the course of the lease. Also, the premises did not have to be delivered in as good condition as they were in the beginning of the lease but only in as good condition as reasonable use and wear would permit. And the language did not designate a certain point in time for referencing the condition of the premises. \"In any event,\" the court opined, \"the common-law rule is so harsh that it ought not to be applied unless the language of the lease clearly requires it.\" 17 Wn.2d at 273.\nIn United Mut. Sav. Bank v. Riebli, 55 Wn.2d 816, 350 P.2d 651 (1960), the rule once again was retained, but avoided on the phraseology, and by denominating the cause of the damage a \"latent defect\". In that case a water pipe ruptured damaging personal property of the lessee, lessor, and third persons. The latter sued both the lessee and lessor, and despite the fact that the lease contained both a maintenance and delivery clause, and a hold harmless clause, the court was able to avoid application of this harsh rule. The lease provided that the lessee had the duty to keep the premises in good repair, and to quit and surrender the premises \"in good order and condition, reasonable wear and damage by the elements excepted. ...\u201d 55 Wn.2d at 822. The hold harmless clause was clear:\n\"... The Lessee shall keep, save and hold harmless the Lessor from any and all damages and liability for anything and everything whatsoever arising from, or out of the occupancy by, or under, the Lessee, . . . and . . . from any fault or negligence by the Lessee, or any failure on the Lessee's part ... or otherwise, or whether it be caused by, . . . the failure of the Lessee ...11\n(Italics ours.) 55 Wn.2d at 822. The court held that neither the repair and delivery clause nor the hold harmless clause made the lessee insurer for a latent defect on the premises.\nAlthough the general rule at common law was to construe a general repair and delivery clause as requiring a tenant to rebuild, the jurisdictions are split on the issue. See 51C C.J.S. Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 368(7) and \u00a7 412 (1968). It is a much criticized rule, most often on the basis that \"repair\" or \"maintain\" does not mean \"rebuild\". See Stoebuck, The Law Between Landlord and Tenant in Washington, 49 Wash. L. Rev. 291, 361-63, 1090 (1974); Decker, Duties of a Tenant To Rebuild After He Has Covenanted To Repair, 6 Iowa B. Rev. 52 (1940). Other jurisdictions have altered the common law rule on this basis. See cases and text in 1 M. Friedman, Leases, \"Damage and Destruction of Leased Property,\" \u00a7 9.1 (1974):\nSome courts refused to follow the common law rule, and held that a covenant by the tenant to repair did not require the tenant to restore after a nonnegligent fire, this on the ground that one could \"repair\" only something in existence and that a covenant to repair could not require the creation of something new. This distinction between \"repair\" and \"restore\" rescued some tenants who had naively agreed to repair, with no suspicion of what the common law attributed to this covenant. However, a repair is a partial restoration and these terms do not necessarily present a clear contrast. Their difference may be of degree rather than of nature.\n(Footnotes containing citations omitted.) Friedman, Leases, supra at 313.\nThe wording in the covenant in the instant case is not as clear as the wording in Armstrong, and although it does not necessarily fall into the exceptions to the rule that were carved out in previous cases, we do not construe this provision as automatically imposing the duty to rebuild on lessee. The language seems to us to describe a duty to maintain as opposed to an obligation to rebuild. It is time that we abandon a rule imposing liability absent fault based on \"magic\" language, the import of which laymen, or indeed lawyers themselves, may not perceive. As we said in Armstrong, what controls in a lease is the intent of the parties at the time of its execution, and the plain meaning of the language used. Where lessor drafts the lease, ambiguities must be resolved in favor of lessee. Armstrong v. Maybee, supra; Puget Inv. Co. v. Wenck, 36 Wn.2d 817, 221 P.2d 459, 20 A.L.R.2d 1320 (1950). We will not extend the obligation of lessee beyond the plain meaning of the language used, and if there is not an express stipulation requiring lessee to rebuild properties destroyed without fault, the loss will fall on the landlord.\nThe plain meaning of maintain or repair is not synonymous with rebuild. \"Repair\" means \"to amend, not to make a new thing\", stated the Nebraska Supreme Court when abolishing the common law rule in that state in Wattles v. South Omaha Ice & Coal Co., 50 Neb. 251, 69 N.W. 785 (1897). The Supreme Court of California made the same distinction in holding that a covenant to repair did not include the complete rebuilding after destruction by fire through no fault of lessee. Realty & Rebuilding Co. v. Rea, 184 Cal. 565, 194 P. 1024 (1920).\nLessee alleged by affidavit that lessor had advised him that the building was fireproof and that he was wasting his money to insure the contents. There is no insurance provision in the lease requiring lessee to insure the buildings; were there it would indicate an intent by both parties to place liability on lessee. Lessee's affidavit also states that the cause of the fire was defective wiring that he in no way altered during his tenancy.\nWithout inquiry into fault on the part of lessee or intent at the time of execution of the lease, and without language expressly holding lessee responsible for rebuilding premises destroyed through no fault of his own, we cannot sustain the trial court. It defies reason and logic to hold lessee to a covenant containing words of art and magic language which lessor says we should construe as an \"express covenant\" to insure against acts of God and other casualties beyond the control of lessee. It is not express. \"Maintain\" does not mean \"rebuild\". One could agree to surrender premises in as good condition as when possession was taken in conjunction with a clause to maintain, and never contemplate their total destruction requiring rebuilding.\nWe hold that summary judgment is improper where, as here, intent is unclear. The case is remanded for trial in accordance with this opinion.\nBrachtenbach, C.J., and Rosellini, Utter, Dolliver, Williams, and Dimmick, JJ., concur.\nStafford and Dore, JJ., concur in the result.",

            "text": "Steinert, J.\nThe lessee of a building brought suit for specific performance of the lessors\u2019 covenant to repair and also for damages alleged to have been sustained by the lessee because of the lessors\u2019 breach of that covenant. Sometime after the commencement of the action, but prior to the time of the trial, the lessors repaired and also repainted the building, and at the hearing before the superior court the lessee conceded that his claim for specific performance had been fully satisfied. The trial therefore proceeded upon the issue of damages alleged to have been sustained by the lessee because of the lessors\u2019 earlier breach of the covenant, in that they had not made the repairs sooner than they did. At the conclusion of the trial, and after taking the cause under advisement, the trial court rendered a memorandum opinion and subsequently entered judgment dismissing the action, but without costs to either party. The plaintiff lessee appealed.\nRespondent lessors are the owners of certain premises situated at the junction of three highways near the city of Renton. On August 16, 1939, they leased the premises, including the building thereon and the equipment therein, to the appellant for use as a restaurant, tavern, and dance hall, for a term of three years beginning October 1, 1939, at a rental of ninety dollars a month. The lease provided that its term of existence could be extended for an additional three-year period at the option of the lessee, on the basis of a monthly rental to be agreed upon by the parties at the end of the original term, and in case of their inability to agree upon the amount of such rental it was to be determined by a committee of three arbitrators.\nThe lease contained a covenant reading as follows:\n\u201cIt is further hereby agreed that the lessors shall keep the exterior of the building, namely roof and walls, in proper condition with necessary painting and will also be responsible for any repairs needed in the sewer connections of the said building.\u201d\nThe front wall and one side wall of the building were of stucco composition and the rest of the building presumably was of the ordinary frame construction. The roof was flat, covered with an asphalt top, and was surrounded on three sides by fire walls.\nAt the end of the original three-year term, appellant elected to take an extension of three additional years as provided in the lease, but the parties were unable to agree upon the amount of the monthly rental for the extension period. Respondents were demanding that the rent be increased to one hundred fifty dollars a month; appellant was insisting that it be reduced to fifty dollars. Appellant was operating the place at that time simply as a tavern and dance hall, where beer, wine, and soft drinks were sold and where dances were held two nights a week, but no meals were then being served. It appears also that for some time past appellant had been complaining that the roof of the building leaked and that the exterior needed painting.\nThe parties being unable to come to any satisfactory agreement, three arbitrators were selected, in the manner provided in the lease, to determine the amount of the monthly rental to be charged during the period of the extension. After an inspection of the building, conferences with the respective parties, and a consultation among themselves, the arbitrators made a written report fixing the amount of such rental at one hundred dollars a month. In their report the arbitrators also expressed the view that the lessors had not fully complied with their obligations to the lessee and recommended \u201cthat the landlord fix up the building better than he has in the past; that is fix the roof; and keep the place in repairs.\u201d It appears, however, that shortly before the arbitrators made their report, respondents had put a new asphalt covering on the roof at an expense of one hundred dollars, although they had not done anything in the way of painting during the entire term of the lease.\nPursuant to the report of the arbitrators, the lease was extended and appellant periodically paid the increased rental of one hundred dollars a month. He continued to make complaint, however, regarding the condition of the roof and exterior walls of the building, and respondents endeavored from time to time to make the roof watertight, but did not immediately paint the exterior. Considerable ill-feeling thus seems to have been engendered between the parties, culminating in the institution of this action by the appellant in July, 1943, which was about nine months after the commencement of the extended period of the lease.\nIn his complaint, as amplified by a bill of particulars, appellant alleged that respondents had breached their covenant to repair by allowing the roof of the building to remain in a leaky condition, with the result that in the rainy season water frequently dripped in various spots upon the dance floor and upon the tables in the adjoining booths, to the great discomfort and annoyance of his patrons, and that respondents had further breached their covenant by failing to paint the exterior of the building, in consequence of which the place had a dilapidated appearance, causing many of his customers to discontinue their patronage. The complaint further alleged that the damages resulting from the respondents\u2019 failure to perform the above-mentioned covenant of the lease amounted to \u201capproximately $10.00 per day,\u201d and recovery in that amount was asked. The prayer of the complaint also asked for specific performance of the covenant of the lease. In their answer to the complaint respondents denied in toto appellant\u2019s allegations respecting breach of covenant and consequent damage.\nInasmuch as the action in its inception was a suit in equity for specific performance of the covenant to repair, the trial court was not required to, and did not, make findings of fact. The court did, however, render a memorandum opinion, in which it carefully reviewed and analyzed the evidence and gave a summary of the facts as, in the opinion of the court, they appeared to be established by the evidence. While there is some conflict in the testimony, the material facts are not greatly in dispute. Our view of the factual situation coincides with that expressed by the trial court and may be briefly stated as follows:\nAbout the time of the expiration of the original term of the lease in 1942, a dispute arose between the parties concerning the amount of monthly rent to be charged during the extended term. On account of the outbreak of the present world war and the construction of various government works and other projects in and near Renton, there had been a great influx of people in the immediate vicinity of the premises here involved. For that reason respondents were demanding that the rent for the extended term be increased from ninety dollars a month to one hundred fifty dollars. Appellant, on the other hand, was insisting that the premises were worth not more than fifty dollars a month. Among other reasons given by the appellant for demanding a reduction in rent were the alleged physical condition and appearance of the building. Appellant complained of the shabby appearance of the place due to the fact that the building had not been painted for five or six years. He also complained that the roof leaked in several places, allowing water to drop onto the dance floor and booths at various spots. Respondents endeavored to repair the roof and during the late summer or early fall of 1942 spent about a hundred dollars in that effort, but did not at that time do anything toward having the building painted.\nThe parties being unable to come to any satisfactory agreement, a committee of arbitrators was selected and the matter of rent was submitted to them for decision. After listening to the contentions of both parties and also investigating the premises, the committee on October 13, 1942, made its report fixing the rental for the extended term at one hundred dollars a month and recommending that respondents fix up the building better than they had done in the past, particularly with reference to the roof.\nThroughout the fall and winter of 1942, and the early part of 1943, appellant continued to make complaint that the roof leaked, at times causing water to drip in spots upon the dance floor and upon the tables in the booths. It was testified that on one occasion it was necessary to set out pans to catch the dripping water, and also to move the patrons who were seated at one of the tables to another part of the room. Frequently there were wet spots upon the ceiling and on one of the walls of the building. However, it does not appear that there was ever any actual interruption of appellant\u2019s business, nor was he ever compelled to close the place, even temporarily.\nIn response to appellant\u2019s complaints concerning the roof, respondents endeavored from time to time to remedy the situation. As stated above, just shortly before the arbitrators made their report in October, 1942, respondents had put a new asphalt coating on the roof at an expense of one hundred dollars. Apparently, however, this did not fully terminate the trouble, at least not to the appellant\u2019s entire satisfaction. At any rate he continued to make complaint throughout the latter part of 1942 and the early part of 1943. As these complaints were conveyed to respondent James Zerwoodis, he would visit the premises, most often with one or two assistants, and from the interior of the building would endeavor to locate the place where the roof was leaking. They would then go up onto the roof and make such repairs as seemed necessary in order to correct the situation. After completing the work they would return to the room below to ascertain whether they had succeeded in stopping the leak. This method of attempted repair was carried on many times, particularly during December, 1942, and January, 1943, and apparently with temporary success; but sooner or later another complaint would be made by the appellant. The difficulty seems to have been that of locating the exact place in the roof where the leak, or leaks, originated. The record is replete, however, with\u2019evidence of the respondents\u2019 continuous efforts to satisfy appellant\u2019s complaints with respect to the leaks. There is also considerable evidence in the record from which the trial court could have found, as it seems to have done, that appellant\u2019s complaints were greatly exaggerated.\nAt any rate, sometime in May, 1943, respondents engaged a contractor to inspect and renovate the entire roof and to paint the exterior of the building. The work could not be done, however, and was not done, until about the first of August of that year. In the meantime, appellant had commenced this action.\nIn his memorandum opinion, the trial judge expressed the view that the respondents had carried out the suggestions of the arbitrators with reference to repairs, and had also repainted the building, as soon as weather and labor conditions permitted. A careful reading of the record convinces us that, while some leakage may have persisted during the time when appellant was making complaint thereof, respondents in turn made every reasonable effort to remedy the situation and did in fact accomplish as good results as could have been expected under the circumstances existing during the latter part of 1942 and the early part of 1943. So far as the painting of the exterior is concerned, we are also satisfied that this was undertaken as soon as it could, and should, have been done.\nIn expressing these conclusions, however, we are not to be understood as holding that respondents were not bound by their covenant or would riot now be liable for any damages which may have actually resulted from their breach thereof, regardless of whether or not such breach came about through their willful neglect. On the contrary, we would be constrained to hold that, having covenanted to keep the roof and walls in proper condition, respondents would be liable for any ascertained damages shown to have been the proximate result of their failure to perform the covenant.\nThe trial court seems to have conceded, and we likewise assume from the very nature of the circumstances narrated above, that appellant was damaged to some extent by respondents\u2019 failure to keep the roof in proper condition against leakage. However, the important question in this case, both in the superior court and in this court, was and is not merely whether the appellant has sustained some damage by respondents\u2019 breach of their covenant, but, rather, whether the appellant has established the amount of his alleged damages by the required degree of proof.\nAppellant\u2019s complaint was drawn upon the theory that the measure of his damages was his loss of profits. At the trial, he endeavored at first to establish recovery strictly upon that theory alone, but later changed his position somewhat, to include as an additional measure of recovery the difference between the rental value of the property in the condition required by the covenant of the lease and the value thereof in the condition in which the property actually was at and prior to the time the action was brought. The trial court held that the evidence was insufficient to establish any definite amount of loss with any reasonable degree of accuracy, under either theory of the measure of damages. This appeal presents the question of whether the trial court was correct in its holding.\nWhile there is a diversity of judicial opinion on the question of the measure of damages recoverable by the lessee from the lessor for the latter\u2019s breach of covenant to repair, the decisions are in general accord upon the postulate that the damages recoverable for the breach of such covenant must be such as are the direct, natural, and proximate result of the breach, and such as may reasonably be supposed to have been within the contemplation of the parties at the time they made the contract; and, conversely, that remote, contingent, or speculative damages are not recoverable. 32 Am. Jur. 592, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 717; 36 C. J. 165, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 801.\nThe most usual rule or measure for assessing a tenant\u2019s damages for breach of his landlord\u2019s covenant to repair or other covenant with respect to the use of property, where there is no claim for, or proof of, special damages, is the difference between the rental value of the property if kept in the condition of repair or utility required by the covenant and the rental value in the condition in which the property actually is. Ingalls v. Beall, 68 Wash. 247, 122 Pac. 1063; Purcell v. Warburton, 70 Wash. 129, 126 Pac. 89; Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co., 102 Wash. 423, 173 Pac. 47; Schermerhorn v. Sayles, 123 Wash. 139, 212 Pac. 156; Yakima Lodge No. 53, K. P. v. Schneider, 173 Wash. 639, 24 P. (2d) 103; 2 Underhill, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 526; 3 Sutherland, Damages (4th ed.), p. 3236; Taylor, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7\u00a7 117, 317; 32 Am. Jur. 593, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 717; 36 C. J. 166, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 801; notes (1924), 28 A. L. R. 1495; (1938), 116 A. L. R. 1239.\nOn the other hand, where special damages, such as loss of profits, are specifically set forth and proved, the recovery by a tenant, for breach of his landlord\u2019s covenant to repair or other covenant with respect to the use of property, is not restricted to the difference in rental value, as expressed in the foregoing general rule, but may also include such loss of profits as has been directly and necessarily caused by the landlord\u2019s wrongful act or default. In such case, however, the loss must be shown with a reasonable degree of certainty and accuracy, and the proof establishing the loss must be clear and convincing, free from speculation or conjecture. These complementary statements express a rule to which this court is definitely committed. Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co., supra; Schermerhorn v. Sayles, supra; accord: Kohne v. White, 12 Wash. 199, 40 Pac. 794; Cordes v. Guy Inv. Co., 146 Wash. 143, 262 Pac. 131. Other cases illustrating the same principle are: DeHoney v. Gjarde, 134 Wash. 647, 236 Pac. 290; Schultz v. Wells Butchers' Supply Co., 151 Wash. 382, 275 Pac. 737; Blakiston v. Osgood Panel & Veneer Co., 173 Wash. 435, 23 P. (2d) 397; Quist v. Zerr, 12 Wn. (2d) 21, 120 P. (2d) 539; Automatic Canteen Co. of Washington v. Automatic Canteen Co. of America, 182 Wash. 133, 45 P. (2d) 41. See, also, 15 Am. Jur. 558, Damages, \u00a7 150.\nThe position taken by this court on this general subject is well illustrated by the case of Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co., supra, which was an action for damages against a landlord for interference with the access of light and ventilation to a storeroom occupied by a tenant. On the question of loss of profits as a measure of damages, the court said:\n\u201cIt may be granted that, in certain cases, a tenant may show a loss of profits in the conduct of an established business where the landlord has unreasonably interfered with the full enjoyment and use of the demised premises. But cases so holding rest in an exception to a general rule, which has twice been declared by this court. Kohne v. White, 12 Wash. 199, 40 Pac. 794; Purcell v. Warburton, 70 Wash. 129, 126 Pac. 89. Interference with light is a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Taylor, Landlord and Tenant, 309(a).\n\u201cThe measure of damages for an interruption of quiet enjoyment by the landlord is the difference between the value of the use of the property as furnished by the landlord and the rent reserved. In other words, it is the diminished value of the use of the property. Tiffany, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 79g; Underhill, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 432; Taylor, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7\u00a7 177 and 317; 16 R. C. L. 770.\n\u201cLoss of profits are usually regarded as too contingent, remote or speculative to be considered. 16 R. C. L. 1056. The general rule should not be departed from unless it is impossible to measure the losses by it, or the character of the business is such and the proof of the profits so clear that the court can say, as a matter of law, that loss of profits was within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made. If this be so, it will declare lost profits to be the measure of damages. . . .\n\u201cBut if it be held that the loss of usable value is not a proper measure of damages, the exception to the rule allowing a loss of profits should not be allowed in this case, for, in sound reason and under all authority, a loss of profits is not allowed unless they can be measured with a fair degree of accuracy. The testimony must be clear and free from taint of speculation or conjecture. The rule rests in a principle applied in all cases for damages arising out of a sale of property or the use of property.\n\u201cTo sustain a verdict for prospective profits, the jury must have some reasonable basis for estimating the worth of the business. From the nature of things, prospective profits cannot be proved to the dollar. Yet the law does demand that there shall be tangible evidence sufficiently clear and convincing to reasonably sustain a verdict. There must be some standard of comparison.\u201d\nAgain, in DeHoney v. Gjarde, supra, this court said:\n\u201cTrue, this court is committed to the rule that loss of profits may be recovered, but we have said that the loss must be shown with a reasonable degree of accuracy, and that the testimony establishing the loss must be clear and free from taint of speculation or conjecture. [Citing cases.]\u201d\nThe trial court applied these rules to the evidence in the instant case and came to the very emphatic conclusion that appellant had not shown any loss of profits with any reasonable degree of accuracy, but that, on the contrary, his testimony on that subject was at best speculative and conjectural. Our examination of the record leads us just as positively to the same conclusion.\nThere was no showing of the amount of profits that appellant had customarily been making, nor was there any convincing evidence concerning the amount of loss of profits due to the condition of the premises. Appellant testified that the bookkeeper\u2019s receipts showed a loss of ten or eleven dollars a day, but no books were produced in court, nor was any explanation given as to how the loss was computed. Appellant testified that some of his patrons quit coming to his place because of the leaky roof, and others because of the dilapidated appearance of the exterior of the place, but there was nothing definite shown as to how many people quit coming, or when they quit, or how much loss of profits was due to that circumstance. It is further to be noted that appellant claimed that his damages amounted to ten dollars a day, as though the roof was constantly leaking every day and every night. Manifestly, that is not true. It is also to be remembered that dances were held only two nights a week, and it was only on those nights that his patrons could have been discommoded by dripping water while dancing. With respect to loss of profits caused by respondents\u2019 delay in painting the building, the proof is even more meager in extent and less certain as to the amount of loss sustained.\nWe recognize that it would be impossible for appellant to establish his loss of profits with mathematical exactness or absolute certainty, and that consequently the law will not hold him to so strict a requirement, but in any event the burden was upon him to prove his loss with at least such certainty and accuracy as would enable the court to find from the evidence that he had been damaged in a stated amount. A reading of the record convinces us that neither the trial court nor anyone else could say that appellant had sustained a loss of profits in any specific amount whatever.\nThe other measure of damages on which appellant relied for recovery was the alleged diminished rental value of the property. He testified that, because of respondents\u2019 failure to repair and repaint the- building, the rental value of the premises was only fifty dollars a month instead of one hundred dollars, the amount he was required to pay, and did pay, during the period of the extension. Appellant\u2019s qualification to testify on that subject is not shown by the record. Assuming for the sake of argument only, that his status as a tenant qualified him to testify thereon, we are not greatly impressed by his testimony in that respect. The arbitrators themselves had recently fixed the rental value at one hundred dollars a month, although that amount was in the nature of a compromise between the claims of the two parties. Moreover, Mr. Zerwoodis, the owner of the building, testified at the trial that the rental value of the property was one hundred fifty dollars a month, and that he could get that amount for it. His testimony upon that question seems to us to have the greater weight. We conclude, as did the trial court, that the appellant likewise failed to establish, by the required degree of proof, his damages upon the basis of the difference in rental value of the property.\nFinally, appellant contends that, in any event, the trial court erred in refusing to award him nominal damages. That contention is without merit upon the appeal for it is the settled rule in this state that where the sole object of the action is the recovery of damages, the failure to give nominal damages is not ground for reversal of a judgment.
