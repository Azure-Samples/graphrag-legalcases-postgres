    "Per Curiam.\nAppellants, Mr. and Mrs. William B. Cloes, rented store space in a building owned by respondents, Mr. and Mrs. R. R. Lee. They appeal from the decision of the trial court, sitting without a jury, which awarded judgment to the Lees for the face amount of a note, given by the Cloeses to secure payment of rent, together with interest and attorney\u2019s fees. The court also dismissed the claim of appellants for damages for destruction of certain goods, stock and fixtures.\nThe errors assigned deal with the court\u2019s failure to apply the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur; a holding that an exculpatory clause in the lease between the parties placed the risk of loss for damages to personal property on the premises upon appellants; and, to the court\u2019s findings of fact that an oral agreement was entered into terminating the tenancy on September 1,1969.\nThe record in this case fails to show whether the question of the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loqui-tur was presented to the trial court. We will not consider, as a ground for reversal of the trial court, a theory not presented at the time of trial. Matthias v. Lehn & Fink Prods. Corp., 70 Wn.2d 541, 424 P.2d 284 (1967); Spinelli v. Economy Stations, Inc., 71 Wn.2d 503, 429 P.2d 240 (1967).\nThe court found the evidence was insufficient to show the freezing of water pipes on the premises which resulted in damage to appellants\u2019 goods was the result of negligence on the part of respondents, or that respondents had prior notice of the defect. The finding has support in the record and the question of whether the exculpatory clause of the lease is valid will not be considered inasmuch as appellants have failed to show any breach of duty by respondents to appellants.\nThe remaining findings of fact to which error is assigned are supported by the record. Judgment affirmed."

    "Simpson, J.\nWe have presented here an action to recover the possession of real property. The cause, tried to the court, resulted in judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.\nIn presenting its appeal, the appellant urges that the trial court committed error in denying appellant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, in granting judgment in favor of plaintiffs, and in denying motion for new trial.\nThe facts are: June 3, 1940, respondents leased to Jobbers Service Co., Inc., certain real property, situated in Pierce county, for a term of five years, beginning July 1, 1940. The rentals were to be paid as follows:\n\u201c$50.00 per month for 12 months\n$65.00 per month for 12 months\n$80.00 per month for 12 months\n$90.00 per month for 24 months.\u201d\nThe written lease, duly acknowledged, provided that:\n\u201cNo assent, expressed or implied, by Lessor, to any breach of Lessee\u2019s covenants shall be deemed or taken to be a waiver of any succeeding breach of covenants,\u201d\nand\n\u201cAt the expiration of this agreement, the Lessee shall have the right of renewing said agreement for the same period of time and upon the same conditions as herein stated.\u201d\nJobbers Service Co., Inc., assigned the lease to appellant, and it conducted upon the property a gasoline service station. Because of certain conditions brought about by the war, the lease was, on February 18, 1942, modified as follows:\n\u201c(1) Effective July 1, 1941 and during such time or times thereafter as the National Emergency shall exist, the rental provided in my lease with you dated June 3, 1940 shall be reduced to $50.00 per month.\n\u201c(2) Except for the above modifications, all other provisions in the lease remain the same.\u201d\nThe modification agreement was not acknowledged, nor was it signed by Mrs. Gattavara. February 22, 1945, appellant notified respondents by letter that it elected to exercise its option to renew the lease for an additional five years,\n\u201c. . . upon the same terms and conditions as stated in the lease and in that certain modification of the lease bearing the date of February 18, 1942.\u201d\nAppellant remained in possession of the premises and has continued to tender the amount of fifty dollars per month as rental.\nThe one question to be determined is whether appellant is entitled to a renewal of the lease. The decision in this case is determined by our holding in Henry v. Bruhn & Henry, 110 Wash. 321, 188 Pac. 506. In that case, it appeared that property was leased to respondents for the\n\u201c \u2018. . . term of five years from February 2nd, 1914, . . . with the right to renew this lease for another five years at the same rental as for the first term of five years.\u2019 \u201d\nIn passing upon the right of the lessee to continue the lease, this court held: A lessee is not compelled to give formal notice of his desire to extend the lease where the original lease is silent as to his obligation to give notice; that a continued possession of the leased premises will be considered as sufficient notice, provided that the continued possession is indicative of an exercise of the option.\nThe rule of law announced in the cited case has been approved in Salzer v. Manfredi, 114 Wash. 666, 195 Pac. 1046. See, also, Union Oil Co. v. Hale, 163 Wash. 503, 2 P. (2d) 87, and the note on \u201cRenewal\u201d in 64 A. L. R. 318.\nThe rule as laid down entitled appellant to a renewal of the original lease for an additional term of five years, by remaining in possession and paying the rent as required in the lease, and did not burden it with the duty of notifying the respondents of the election to renew. This being the case, the letter notifying respondents of the election to continue the lease was of no material importance.\nRespondents argue that the modification agreement was a nullity because it was not acknowledged, and that, by mentioning it in the letter of February 22, 1945, appellant in fact, and as a matter of law, elected to renew under the terms of a new lease which was not enforcible. We cannot so hold. Appellant did mention the modification agreement, it is true, but it did not in any way indicate that it was surrendering its rights under the original lease. The modification agreement had been complied with for some time by both parties. Appellant had paid the monthly rental provided therein, and respondents had received that amount without any objection. It was but natural that the appellant should mention the so-called modification agreement.\nSome complaint is made that the payment of fifty dollars per month which appellant tendered as the rental for the first year of the continued lease was not in accordance with the terms of the original agreement; that, under its terms, appellant must continue to pay the sum of ninety dollars per month as the rental provided for the last year mentioned in the contract. The lease is very plain as to payments which are to be paid as rental, and, when appellant elected to continue the lease for five additional years, it was entitled to profit by the benefit of the terms mentioned in the written instrument. It does seem out of the ordinary that the rental payments for the second term should, be reduced from ninety dollars a month to fifty dollars per month. However, the parties agreed to be bound by all of the provisions contained in the original lease, and this court cannot change those terms, because to so do would amount to rewriting the contract.\nThe judgment of the trial court is reversed.\nMallery, C. J., Millard, Schwellenbach, and Abel, JJ., concur."

    "Ott, J.\nOctober 30,1954, the Washington Building Company leased \u201cthat certain store space known as 1025 Pacific Avenue,\u201d in Tacoma, Washington, to Donald H. Hutch-ins for an ice cream and soda fountain business. November 30, 1955, the lease was assigned to Arthur A. Riebli and George Hoertrich, Jr., with the consent of the building company. During the weekend prior to October 29, 1956, a water pipe imbedded in the cementlike floor of the leased premises ruptured. Monday morning at 7:30 a. m., the maintenance superintendent of the building company discovered that the basement of the building had been flooded. The flow of water from the ruptured pipe was shut off by a valve which controlled the service of water to the leased premises. The water caused damage to some doors stored by the building company in a basement storeroom, to merchandise stored by the Washington Camera Mart in its basement storeroom, and to a rug on the floor in the basement safe-deposit vault lobby of the United Mutual Savings Bank.\nThe Washington Camera Mart brought suit against Riebli and Hoertrich to recover for its loss. The bank sued Riebli, Hoertrich, and the building company. The building company cross-complained against Riebli and Hoertrich for damages to its doors and for indemnity for any damages it might be required to pay to the bank. The causes were consolidated for trial.\nThe court entered judgment for both plaintiffs and also entered judgment for the building company on its cross-complaint. Riebli and Hoertrich have appealed.\nThe evidence disclosed, inter alia, (1) that the respondents\u2019 premises were damaged by water; (2) that the water came from a ruptured pipe imbedded in the cementlike floor of the premises leased by the appellants; (3) that the pipe was installed in 1947, with the consent of the building company, by a former tenant when he remodeled the premises, and had since remained untouched; (4) that water was supplied by the building company to the appellants\u2019 premises through a system of pipes which it maintained and over which it retained control, the water being piped to a reservoir on the top floor of the building and from there to the various parts of the building; (5) that the appellants were not assignees of Fox, who had installed the pipe, but were in possession as the assignees of the Hutchins lease, and (6) that the lease provided that the tenants had the duty to keep the leased premises in repair and, under certain conditions, to save the building company harmless from occupational liability.\nThe court predicated appellants\u2019 liability to the Washington Camera Mart and to the bank upon the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. The court erred in applying the doctrine to the facts of this case.\nBefore the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur can be applied, exclusive control of the offending instrumentality by the appellants must be established by the evidence. In this regard, Prosser on Torts (2d ed.) 204, \u00a7 42, states the rule as follows:\n\u201cIt is never enough for the plaintiff to prove merely that he has been injured by the negligence of someone unidentified. Even though there is beyond all possible doubt negligence in the air, it is still necessary to bring it home to the defendant. On this too the plaintiff has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence; and in any case where it is clear that it is at least equally probable that the negligence was that of another, the court must instruct the jury that the plaintiff has not proved his case. . . .\n\u201cThis element usually is stated as meaning that the defendant must be in \u2018exclusive control\u2019 of the instrumentality which has caused the accident. . . .\n\u201c. . . It would be far better, and much confusion would be avoided, if the idea of \u2018control\u2019 were discarded altogether, and we were to say merely that the apparent cause of the accident must be such that the defendant would be responsible for any negligence connected with it.\u201d\nIn Morner v. Union Pac. R. Co., 31 Wn. (2d) 282, 294, 196 P. (2d) 744 (1948), this court said:\n\u201c . . . one of the elements essential to the invocation of that doctrine [res ipsa loquitur] is that the party charged with actionable negligence must have sole and exclusive control of the agency or instrumentality which actually caused the injury. If there is no such exclusive control, or if the injury was caused, or may reasonably be said to have been caused, by the concurrent acts of two or more persons or agencies functioning independently of each other, the doctrine does not apply.\u201d\nAccord, 1 Shearman and Redfield, Negligence (Rev. ed.) 153, \u00a7 56; 65 C. J. S. 1014 et seq., \u00a7 220 (8).\nIn Hogland v. Klein, 49 Wn. (2d) 216, 298 P. (2d) 1099 (1956), we recognized that the requirement of control does not mean actual physical control, but refers to legal control or responsibility for the proper and efficient functioning of the instrumentality that caused the injury.\nUnder the facts of this case, was the offending pipe under the exclusive control of the appellants?\nRespondents rely upon Kind v. Seattle, 50 Wn. (2d) 485, 312 P. (2d) 811 (1957). In the cited case, a water main was held to be under the \u201cexclusive control\u201d of the city, when it was installed by the city, maintained by the city up to and at the time of the accident, and the water was supplied by the city. See, also, Klise v. Seattle, 52 Wn. (2d) 412, 325 P. (2d) 888 (1958).\nIn the instant case, the appellants did not install the offending pipe. They did not select the kind or quality of pipe used. They had no control over the water supply. The evidence failed to establish the element of \u201cexclusive control,\u201d which is a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\nFurther, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is based in part upon the theory that negligence will be presumed because the defendant either knew of the cause of the accident, or had the best opportunity of ascertaining the cause and, therefore, should be required to produce evidence in explanation. Shay v. Parkhurst, 38 Wn. (2d) 341, 229 P. (2d) 510 (1951); Morner v. Union Pac. R. Co., supra; Lynch v. Ninemire Packing Co., 63 Wash. 423, 115 Pac. 838 (1911).\nIn this case, there was no proof that the appellants had prior knowledge of the cause of the accident or that they had the best opportunity to know of it. When they took possession of the premises, the imbedded pipe was in place and had remained there untouched during their occupancy.\nThere remains the question of whether the judgment in favor of the Washington Building Company and against the appellants can be sustained because of the following provisions of the lease:\n\u201cThe Parties Hereto Further Agree, As Follows: . . .\n\u201c(2) Throughout the term of this lease, the Lessee will take good care of the demised premises and appurtenances, alterations and improvements, and will keep same in good repair, and at or before the end of the term will repair all injury done by the installation or removal of equipment and fixtures, it being understood that the Lessee shall have the right to remove equipment and fixtures; and, at the end of the term, the Lessee will quit and surrender the demised premises, with all alterations and improvements, in good order and condition, reasonable wear and damage by the elements excepted. . . .\n\u201c(6) The Lessor shall not be liable for damage caused the Lessee by bursting or leaking of any water, gas, or steam pipe by accident or by neglect of other tenants or occupants of the building or their employees. . . .\n\u201c (8) The Lessor shall have the right to enter the premises at reasonable times and intervals to examine the same or to make repairs or alterations. . . .\n\u201c(11) The Lessee agrees to use the leased premises as a careful and prudent person would use his own, and upon the expiration of the term to surrender the premises to the Lessor in as good condition as at the beginning of the term of this lease, save for wear and tear from reasonable and careful use. . . .\n\u201c (14) The Lessee shall keep, save and hold harmless the Lessor from any and all damages and liability for anything and everything whatsoever arising from, or out of the occupancy by, or under, the Lessee, the Lessee\u2019s agents or servants, and from any loss or damage arising from any fault or negligence by the Lessee, or any failure on the Lessee\u2019s part to comply with any of the covenants, terms and conditions herein contained, or otherwise, or whether it be caused by, or be due to, the failure of the Lessee to perform any of the covenants herein, expressed or implied, that are to be performed by the Lessee.\u201d\nRespondents rely upon \u00a7 14, supra. Liability under that section of the lease arises upon (1) appellants\u2019 failure to comply with the terms of the lease, and (2) damages arising from or out of appellants\u2019 occupancy of the premises.\nAs to (1), it was not shown that appellants failed to comply with the terms of the lease. Regarding (2), we are of the opinion that, construing the contract as a whole, the parties intended that the appellants were obligated to \u201ctake good care\u201d of the leased premises during their occupancy, and to make a reasonable and careful use thereof. They were liable only for damage caused by unreasonable and careless use of the premises. The imbedded pipe in some manner ruptured during the appellants\u2019 occupancy. The fact of the rupture alone does not establish that the use of the premises by the appellants was unreasonable or careless. The burden of proving that the water damage was caused by appellants\u2019 failure to comply with the terms and covenants of the lease, or by their unreasonable use of the premises, was not met by the respondents.\nNor does the covenant (\u00a72, supra) which placed upon the appellants the duty to repair make them insurers of latent defects in the premises. The covenant to repair carries with it no more than the duty to repair known defects or defects which could have been discovered by the exercise of due care. Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co., 79 Wash. 643, 140 Pac. 909 (1914); Bernhard v. Reeves, 6 Wash. 424, 33 Pac. 873 (1893).\nThere is no evidence in the record before us that the defect was known to the appellants or that appellants, by the exercise of due care, could have discovered it. The proof established nothing more than a latent defect for which appellants assumed no contractual liability.\nFinally, respondents contend that the offending pipe was a trade fixture. Assuming, arguendo, that the pipe, at the time it was installed by the then tenant, Fox, was a trade fixture and so regarded by Fox and the owner of the building, it lost its identity as a trade fixture and became part of the building when it was leased by the owner as a part of the over-all premises to the appellants\u2019 assignor, Hutchins.\n\u201c \u2018The true criterion of a fixture is the united application of these requisites: (1) Actual annexation to the realty, or something appurtenant thereto; (2) application to the use or purpose to which that part of the realty with which it is connected is appropriated; and (3) the intention of the party making the annexation to make a permanent accession to the freehold.\u2019 \u201d Forman v. Columbia Theater Co., 20 Wn. (2d) 685, 695, 148 P. (2d) 951 (1944), quoting with approval from Filley v. Christopher, 39 Wash. 22, 80 Pac. 834 (1905).\nApplying these tests to the facts in the instant case, the pipe was securely imbedded in the concretelike floor, and was applied to the use of these premises as an ice cream parlor and soda fountain. The actual intention of Fox, who made the annexation, does not appear, but, from the above and from the fact that he did not remove it at the termination of his lease, we must presume that his intention was to make the pipe a permanent annexation to the freehold. Under these facts, it is clear that the pipe became a permanent part of the building company\u2019s water supply system and was leased as a part of the freehold to appellants\u2019 assignor.\nFor the reasons stated, the judgments are reversed, and the causes remanded with instructions to enter judgments dismissing the complaints and the cross-complaint.\nWeaver, C. J., Hill, Donworth, Finley, and Foster, JJ., concur."

    "Hill, J.\nA seven-and-one-half-year farm tenancy having expired, the owners of the property,' hereinafter called the landlord, sued the former tenant, hereinafter called the tenant, for damages because of the condition in which the farm was left and the removal or destruction of certain property, all of which constituted breaches of certain covenants in the lease. The tenant cross-complained and asked for damages to his hay, occasioned by the failure of the landlord to keep the roof of the barn in repair.\nThe trial court found for the landlord on numerous items of damage ranging from $15 to $250 and aggregating $1,261, and found against the tenant on his cross-complaint.\nThe tenant appeals, making twelve assignments of error, ten of the first eleven challenging the sufficiency of the evidence on various items of damage, either as to the fact of damage or the amount thereof, or both. The twelfth assignment of error challenges the failure of the court to award him judgment on his cross-complaint.\nA discussion of each assignment of error would involve a detailing of the evidence on each item of damage and take several pages of our reports and be of interest to no one unless it be the litigants. We will content ourselves with the statement that, although the evidence is frequently in conflict, it is sufficient to sustain every finding of fact by the trial court.\nOn only four of the twelve assignments of error are there any citations of authority, and the law points involved are relatively few and simple. One somewhat novel argument relates to the destruction of a small orchard. The tenant urges that, since the land is worth more for dairy purposes than it was as an orchard, there can be no damage. This overlooks that fact that the landlord owns the premises and was entitled to have an orchard if he wanted it, or, as we said in Park v. Northport Smelting & Refining Co., 47 Wash. 597, 92 Pac. 442, \u201che is entitled to the benefit of his property intact.\u201d We pointed out in that case that where a part of the real property is destroyed, the loss may be estimated upon the dimunition in the value of the premises, if any results, or upon the value of the part severed or destroyed; and that the measure of damages should be adopted which would prove most beneficial to the injured party. The judgment for $75 for the destruction of the orchard was well within the evidence.\nThe one assignment of error among the first eleven that does not concern itself with the fact or the amount of damage as to certain items is No. 8, which raises a question as to whether title to certain articles had passed to the tenant by a bill of sale. It is there urged that a hot water heater, gas pump and mailbox which had been installed by the landlord prior to the tenancy and had been removed by the tenant, were equipment within the terms of a bill of sale from the landlord to the tenant covering \u201cAll cattle, horses, feed, seed, farm machinery and equipment, delivery trucks, and retail routes,\u201d which was executed at the time the parties entered into the lease. The tenant cites cases to the effect that the parol evidence rule is a rule of substantive law, with which we agree; but no parol evidence was necessary to indicate to any fair-minded man that the bill of sale was not intended to convey items so obviously fixtures (as between landlord and tenant) as the hot water heater, the gas pump and the mailbox. Nor do we see any basis for the tenant\u2019s contention that the bill of sale so clearly covered the furniture, dishes and utensils that it was a violation of the parol evidence rule to show that they were not intended to be conveyed by it.\nNeither is there any substance to the claim that, if the water heater was converted by the tenant to his own use, it was done in 1940 or 1941, and that, therefore, the action for damages on that item was barred by the statute of limitations. The landlord would have no reason to believe that the water heater would not be returned tvhen the lease expired, and his cause of action for the breach of covenant to \u201creturn the premises to the lessors in as good condition as received or better\u201d did not mature until the termination of the lease in 1947. 32 Am. Jur. 693, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 815. The action was commenced in 1948 and was therefore not barred by any statute of limitations.\nThat the tenant had some hay damaged as the result of a leaking roof is established; there is also evidence that the landlord made all repairs as quickly as could reasonably be expected after the necessity therefor was reported to him. We have recently had occasion to point out that, before a lessee can recover damages from a lessor for breach of a covenant to keep in repair, he must establish timely notice to the lessor of the need for repairs and that the lessor failed to make them within a reasonable time under the circumstances. Franklin v. Fischer, 34 Wn. (2d) 342, 208 P. (2d) 902, and authorities there cited.\nAs previously indicated, it seems to us that there is evidence supporting every finding of fact made by the trial court and that it drew the proper conclusions of law therefrom. There being no reason to disturb any part of the judgment, it is affirmed in its entirety.\nSimpson, C. J., Robinson, Mallery, and Hamley, JJ., concur."

    "Neill, J.\nPlaintiff landlord brings an action for rents accrued under a lease. Defendant tenant (assignee of original lessee) appeals from a judgment awarding plaintiff the full rentals, contending (1) that there had been a constructive eviction; (2) that he had surrendered the premises and plaintiff has accepted such surrender; and (3) that any liability for rentals is limited to $850 by the terms of a liquidated damages provision of the lease.\nNo error is assigned to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and they are accepted as the verities on this appeal. Riley v. Rhay, 76 Wn.2d 32, 454 P.2d 820 (1969). From these findings and the supporting record, the following relevant facts emerge.\nThe plaintiff leased gasoline service station premises in Seattle to Harris Petroleum Co. The lease was executed in March of 1957 for a term of 10 years, with rental of $425 per month reserved. The lease agreement acknowledged a deposit of $850\nas security for the faithful performance by Lessee of all the terms and conditions of this lease . . . which deposit shall be applied upon the last two (2) months rental [if the lessee performs, or] . . . shall be retained by Lessor as liquidated damages in the event Lessee fails to so perform.\nIn September of 1962, by assignment and with the lessor\u2019s consent, defendant succeeded to the position of tenant under this lease agreement.\nIn 1959, 3 years before defendant became the tenant, Harris Petroleum had complained to plaintiff that automobiles of plaintiff\u2019s adjacent used car lot were being parked in such manner as to interfere with access to the service station. No further complaints appear to have been made by either Harris Petroleum or defendant, and each respective tenant continued to pay the reserved rent and occupy the premises until they were vacated and abandoned by defendant. Customer access to the service station has been continuously available.\nWhen station operations proved to be unprofitable, defendant investigated the possibility of remodeling, but this proved to be impracticable. Then, in November of 1964, defendant informed plaintiff that it was \u201ccancelling\u201d the lease. One reason advanced for this was that the premises were no longer suitable for use as a gasoline station. As an explanation, or as a separate reason for vacating, defendant stated that businesses which had been located on adjoining property when the lease term commenced were no longer in operation. (We observe from the record that these other businesses had left before defendant took the lease assignment from Harris Petroleum and that this was known to defendant at that time.)\nPlaintiff responded through his attorneys in a letter dated November 16, 1964: \u201cNotice is hereby given that the lessor will insist upon the terms of the. lease and does not concur in the cancellation attempted by Petroleum Products.\u201d This intent to insist upon the tenant\u2019s performance is further reflected in subsequent letters of December 11, 1964, (\u201cMr. Pague does not recognize your right to terminate the lease.\u201d) and January 4, 1965 (\u201cMr. Pague is insisting upon your carrying out this lease.\u201d). There was neither vagueness nor equivocation in plaintiff\u2019s expressions of intent.\nFollowing defendant\u2019s abandonment of the premises, plaintiff made reasonable and good-faith attempts to rerent or sell the premises, but without avail. During that time, plaintiff did park some of the automobiles from the adjacent used car lot upon a portion of the premises, but neither the duration, the extent, nor the value of this use was established by evidence.\nUpon these facts, the trial court concluded that a lease existed between plaintiff and defendant; that the landlord had made a good-faith attempt to rerent the premises; and that accrued rental to the time of the trial was due in the sum of $11,475, plus interest. Judgment was entered accordingly.\nThe facts do not support the defendant\u2019s contention that it was evicted. In order for a vacating tenant to claim constructive eviction, it is essential that he give the landlord notice of the act or condition complained of and an opportunity to remove or correct the condition. California Bldg. Co. v. Drury, 103 Wash. 577, 175 P. 302 (1918); Erickson v. Elliott, 177 Wash. 229, 31 P.2d 506 (1934). Further, there is no eviction where, as here, the only complaint was made long before the vacating of the premises \u00a1and the tenant has continued in occupancy and to pay rent without further or continuing complaint. California Bldg. Co. v. Drury, supra. The record reveals only a single instance of complaint to the landlord, and this was not by the defendant, but by his predecessor. It was made 3 years before the assignment and 5 years before defendant abandoned the premises.\nDefendant next contends that its abandonment was transformed into a surrender and acceptance by the landlord\u2019s subsequent use of the premises in connection with his used car operation, or, in the alternative, that the reasonable value of this use should be credited against the amount due for rentals.\nWhen a tenant has wrongfully abandoned his leasehold, he cannot thereafter designate any subsequent occupation or control of the premises by his landlord as a surrender and acceptance. In such cases, the subsequent use by the landlord must be substantial enough to evidence a reappropriation of the premises and an intent on his part to foreclose any future rights of the tenant in the premises. There is no evidence to establish the duration, extent or value of the landlord\u2019s subsequent use of the premises. This failure to produce evidence on value, duration and extent is fatal to the defendant\u2019s contention. The burden is on the party claiming credit to put in evidence as to amount. The tenant failed so to do.\nDefendant\u2019s final contention is that, in any event, the amount recoverable by the plaintiff is limited to $850 by the terms of the lease agreement. The relevant provisions read:\nThe Lessee has paid to and the Lessor acknowledges receipt of the sum of Eight Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($850.00) as security for the faithful performance by Lessee of all the terms and conditions of this lease to be performed by Lessee, which deposit shall be applied upon the last two (2) months rental of the aforesaid term in the event of such performance by the Lessee; and which deposit shall be retained by Lessor as liquidated damages in the event Lessee fails to so perform.\nIf the Lessee shall fail to keep and perform any of the covenants and agreements herein contained, then Lessor may cancel this lease upon giving the notice required by law and re-enter said premises, retaining the sum deposited as security herewith as liquidated damages.\nFor present purposes, it will be assumed that the above language constitutes a liquidated damages clause.\nWe first observe that a landlord is not ordinarily precluded from his right to rentals reserved under a lease by the tenant\u2019s act of wrongful abandonment. As we observed in the case of Brown v. Hayes, 92 Wash. 300, 302, 159 P. 89 (1916):\n[Wjhen a tenant abandons the premises without just cause and refuses to pay rent, the landlord may either treat the term as still subsisting and sue for the installments of rent reserved as they accrue; or, treating the lease as terminated by the tenant\u2019s breach, reenter and sue for damages for the breach.\nAccord, 3A Thompson, Real Property \u00a7 1306 (1959).\nWrongful abandonment by a tenant presents the landlord with alternative remedies. He may choose to terminate the lease and sue for damages. Benjamin Franklin Thrift Stores v. Jared, 192 Wash. 252, 73 P.2d 525 (1937); Mon Wai v. Parks, 43 Wn.2d 562, 262 P.2d 196 (1953). As we have already noted, the plaintiff took no action following defendant\u2019s abandonment which indicated an intent to terminate the lease term. To the contrary, express declarations show a clear and unwavering intent to elect to treat the lease term as subsisting and sue for rent. Of course, a person\u2019s declarations may be belied by his actions, but defendant has not shown such contrary conduct by the plaintiff.\nThe lessee contends that the above quoted language in the lease not only limits the amount recoverable should the lessor elect to treat the lease as terminated and sue for damages, but also precludes the lessor from electing the alternative remedy of an action for rent reserved.\nThe language of the lease does not specifically tie the liquidated damages clause to a breach of the covenant to pay rent. We also note that the lease agreement does not expressly limit the landlord to an action for damages upon a breach of the agreement. The language used states that the lessor may cancel the lease if the lessee fails to perform. This language gives no indication that the parties intended to eliminate a possible remedy. Under these circumstances we will not infer such an intent.\nTo hold, as defendant urges, that a general liquidated damages clause not only limits the amount recoverable in an action for damages but also compels the lessor to seek his remedy in damages would be to hold that this court will choose between two possible inferences the one which denies a remedy to the innocent party. We 'are unwilling to create such a rule.\nDefendant cites and relies on several of our prior cases as support for his position that plaintiff is limited to an action for damages. We have, already pointed out that Benjamin Franklin Thrift Stores v. Jared, supra, and Mon Waiv. Parks, supra, are cases wherein the landlord elected to terminate the lease, thus limiting his remedy to an action for damages. These cases do not stand for the proposition that the landlord could not recover for accruing rents if the lease were subsisting.\nThe case of Pacific & Puget Sound Bottling Co. v. Clithero, 162 Wash. 156, 298 P. 316 (1931), is not applicable to this situation. There, the landlord brought an action to terminate the lease and recover accrued rents. A liquidated damages provision in that lease was expressly made applicable to a default in the payment of rents. We held that the landlord was foreclosed from a recovery of rentals beyond the liquidated amount stipulated in the lease. We did not there hold that that lease provision for liquidated damages eliminated the landlord\u2019s right to treat the term as continuing and sue for rents accruing after the tenant\u2019s breach. That question was not before us. Neither did we hold that, should a landlord elect to terminate a lease and sue for damages, a general liquidated damages provision which neither, expressly nor impliedly limited the amount recoverable for a breach of the covenant to pay rent would be applicable. The crucial factor in that case was the clear application of the liquidated damages clause under consideration to the 'amount recoverable in an action for damages for breach of the covenant to pay rent. The landlord was bringing just such an action.\nThe case of Oldfield v. Angeles Brewing & Malting Co., 62 Wash. 260, 113 P. 630 (1911), is also distinguishable as it involved an agreement to enter tenancy. In such situations, the parties do not occupy the relationship of landlord and tenant, but are parties to a separate and independent contract.\n1 Tiffany, Real Property \u00a7 76 at 113 (3d ed. 1939):\nThe words \u201ctenant\u201d and \u201clessee\u201d are frequently used by the courts with considerable looseness, as if equivalent in meaning. The word \u201clessee\u201d should however be applied only to the person to whom the lease is originally made, while the word \u201ctenant\u201d is applicable to 'any person who holds possession under a lease, whether the original lessee or the latter\u2019s assignee. A lessee, provided he has entered under the lease, is necessarily a tenant, but a tenant is not necessarily a lessee . . .24\n24 An illustration of the importance of this distinction is where one executes an instrument of lease and does not enter under it. In such case, while he is a lessee, he has never become a tenant. As one consequence, termination of the lease by the lessor does not constitute eviction, and his liability to the lessor is, in such case, for damages and not for rent.\nOldfield is in accordance with this distinction as the lessee had refused to take possession of the premises. See 32 Am. Jur. Landlord & Tenant \u00a7 27 (1941); 3 Thompson, Real Property \u00a7 1031, at 96 (1959).\nIn Oldfield, the plaintiff could not avail himself of the election of remedies which our law gives to a landlord because he did not occupy that position. That case is not authority for the contention made here that one who is in a position of landlord can be denied his election of remedies by a general liquidated damages clause.\nThis case does not raise an issue as to whether the amount recoverable in an action for rent should be affected by a rule corollary to the rule of mitigation of damages, since it is clear from this record that the landlord made every reasonable effort to relet or sell the premises. See Wright v. Baumann, 239 Ore. 410, 398 P.2d 119 (1965), 21 A.L.R.3d 527 (1968); Annot., 21 A.L.R.3d 534 (1968); Martin v. Siegley, 123 Wash. 683, 212 P. 1057 (1923). Neither are we here concerned with the effect of the landlord\u2019s subsequent use of a part of the premises, since the extent, duration and value, if any, of this use has not been shown.\nJudgment affirmed.\nHunter, C. J., Hill and Rosellini, JJ., and Donworth, J. Pro Tern., concur.\nJanuary 6,1970. Petition for rehearing denied."

    "Donworth, J.\nThis action was instituted by plaintiffs as owners and lessors of certain real property to recover unpaid rentals under a written lease. . Martha Remmen, the original lessee, and Ethel Clothier, the assignee of the lease, were joined as parties defendant. Defendants filed separate answers to the complaint. Defendant Remmen set forth certain affirmative defenses, cross-complained for relief \u00bfgainst plaintiffs, and prayed, in the event that judgment be entered against her, for judgment over against defendant Clothier for such sum as she might be required to pay. Defendant Clothier, by way of affirmative defense and cross-complaint, pleaded two counterclaims, one for damages for deceit practiced by plaintiffs and the other for damages based upon breach of the lease on their part.\nThe trial was held to the court sitting without a jury. At the conclusion of the case, the court made findings of fact, conclusions of law, and entered a judgment which dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 action, awarded defendant Clothier damages on her first affirmative defense and cross-complaint, and denied further relief to either defendant except costs of suit. Plaintiffs\u2019 alternative motions for judgment notwithstanding the decision and for new trial were denied. Plaintiffs appeal from the judgment.\nThe Maynard building, consisting of five stories and a basement, was built in 1892 for use as an office building. It is located at 121-123 First avenue south in Seattle\u2019s skid-road district. In 1927, it was classified by the building department as an office building. That classification has never been changed. Over the years since its erection, the character of the neighborhood has deteriorated so that there is little or no demand for office space there.\nAppellants purchased the building in 1936 and have continuously leased, the building for offices, light manufacturing, storage, assembly halls, and general commercial uses. Under the building code of the city of Seattle (ordinance No. 72200, as amended), an \u201coffice building\u201d is defined as:\n\u201cA building that is used or occupied predominantly for offices but may contain a limited amount of shops for supplying food, drink or other bodily comfort or needs, and below the third story may be used or occupied for commercial purposes not prohibited by this Code.\u201d (Italics ours.)\nIn September, 1947, Martha Eemmen\u2019s lease on the Yesler hotel was about to terminate, and she needed a place to store all her hotel furnishings. She consulted appellant Harry Buttnick as to the possibility of leasing the Maynard building for that purpose. He informed her that the building was for rent and directed her to consult his real-estate agent. On September 26, 1947, a lease entitling her to the use and possession of the Maynard building (exclusive of the basement) subject to existing tenancies was executed. Copies of the existing month-to-month tenancy agreements were supplied to her.\nThe lease was for a two-year term commencing October 1, 1947, at a monthly rental of five hundred dollars, and included an option provision by which the lessee could elect to extend the term of the lease for an additional five years. Assignments or subleases of any portion of the premises without written consent of the lessors were prohibited. Under the heading \u201cBusiness Purpose,\u201d it was provided that the premises were to be used for the purpose of conducting therein any lawful business or subletting any portion thereof for any lawful purpose.\nMartha Remmen took possession of the premises and stored her hotel furniture on the second, third, and fourth floors. She sublet various other portions of the building for purposes identical to those previously existing. One of her tenants was Ethel Clothier, who leased part of the first floor on a month-to-month tenancy, where she conducted a dairy supply business of which she was sole proprietor.\nIn January, 1948, Martha Remmen indicated to Ethel Clothier that she was interested in disposing of her interest in the leasehold and was in touch with some interested parties. Ethel Clothier was afraid that if some one else took over the lease she might be required to pay a higher rental than the $125 per month which she was paying, or move her business from the building. Primarily to forestall these possibilities, she agreed with Mrs. Remmen to purchase her interest in the lease. An assignment (subject to all existing tenancies) was executed on February 18, 1948. Ethel Clothier, as assignee, agreed to make all payments required under the lease and to perform all covenants, conditions, terms, stipulations, and agreements contained therein. In consideration of appellants\u2019 consent to the assignment, Mrs. Remmen guaranteed performance by the assignee of the terms of the lease.\nAppellants also, as a condition precedent to their consenting to this assignment of the leasehold interest, required that Ethel Clothier elect to exercise the option to extend the term of the lease for the period of five years from October 1, 1949. The extension agreement extending the term of the lease to September 30, 1954, was executed on February 28, 1948, and was signed by appellants and by both Martha Remmen and Ethel Clothier.\nUp to the time of the execution of the extension agreement, neither Martha Remmen nor Ethel Clothier knew that the Maynard building had been classified as an office building in 1927. Appellants were aware of the classification and had previously been notified by city officials that certain structural alterations and changes would be required if the building was used for other than office purposes. Ethel Clothier was first notified of this condition on April 29, 1948, when appellants forwarded to her a copy of a letter sent to their agent by the chief of the fire department. It was dated March 24, 1948, and required fourteen specific alterations if the building was to be used for other than office purposes above the second floor. The cost of doing all that the city considered necessary to comply with the building code was very substantial, and Ethel Clothier informed appellants that she considered it their duty under the terms of the lease to make these alterations. Appellants and Ethel Clothier thereupon commenced negotiations with a view of adjusting their differences.\nIn April, 1949, the building was damaged by an earthquake. Appellants caused repairs to be made to the building, but Ethel Clothier was dissatisfied with the amount of work done.\nEthel Clothier paid the monthly rental of five hundred dollars in accordance with the lease until November 1, 1949, when she failed to make the rental payment which then became due. This default was subsequent to the expiration of the original two-year term. On December 8, 1949, she notified appellants by letter that, by reason of their misrepresentations concerning the purpose for which the premises could be used, their failure to comply with the requirements of the city building department and the city fire department, and their failure to adequately repair the earthquake damage, they had breached the lease, and she would pay only such rental as was reasonable for the tenantable portion of the building. Pending further negotiations, the parties temporarily agreed on a rental of $385 a month, with the understanding that the payment and acceptance of this rental would be without prejudice to the rights of either party.\nIn July, 1950, a gas main in the street exploded and damaged the building. Appellants again caused repairs to be made, but Ethel Clothier again was not satisfied with them. The trial court found that appellants had adequately repaired the earthquake and explosion damage and no cross-appeal has been taken by either respondent.\nThe parties were unable to compose their differences concerning the alterations required by the fire chief and this action was instituted in October, 1950.\nThereafter on January 5, 1951, the fire department of the city of Seattle posted a notice on the building which stated that it was unlawful to occupy the premises for any purpose except as an office building. This notice consisted of a printed cardboard form approximately eleven by eight inches. The following is a copy of the notice with inserted material in italics:\n\u201cCity of Seattle\nFire Department\nNOTICE!\nIs hereby given that it is unlawful to occupy except as an office building any portion of this building, located at [Number] 119-lst South on Lot 5 of Block 1, Addition Maynard, until this notice has been removed by a representative of the Fife Department and until written authority to occupy [said] the building has been given the owner or lessee by the Chief of the Fire Department.\n\u201c(Signed) Wm. Fitzgerald\nChief of Fire Department\nBy Howard S. McGee\nFire Inspector\n\u201cDate of Posting' 5 January 1951\n\u201cWarning \u2014 The removal, mutilation, destruction or concealment of this notice is a misdemeanor punishable by fine and imprisonment.\n\u201cEvery day that any person shall continue to occupy premises after the issuance and posting of a notice by the Chief of Fire Department directing their vacation shall be deemed a separate offense committed by the owner or his agent.\u201d\nAppellants\u2019 brief contains nineteen assignments of error, in which they contend that the trial court erred in admitting certain evidence, in overruling appellants\u2019 motions challenging the sufficiency of respondents\u2019 evidence, in making and entering certain findings of fact and conclusions of law, in entering judgment in favor of respondents, and in denying appellants\u2019 alternative motions for judgment notwithstanding the decision and for new trial.\nIn order to render a decision in this case, it is necessary to discuss only a few of these assignments. In their first major argument, appellants contend that fraud was not an issue in this case because respondent Remmen neith\u00e9r pleaded nor claimed it, and, although respondent Clothier alleged fraud in her first affirmative defense and cross-complaint, she waived it early in the trial when she elected to affirm the lease and sue for damages.\nThe record discloses a long and somewhat confusing colloquy between the court and counsel with regard to the exact extent of respondent Clothier\u2019s election, but we believe that, by electing to affirm the lease and sue for damages, she waived only her right to sue for rescission of the lease.\nThis court has previously held that, after the discovery of fraud, a lessee may elect to affirm the lease, thereby waiving his right to rescission, and still maintain an action for damages based on deceit. Salter v. Heiser, 39 Wn. (2d) 826, 239 P. (2d) 327, and cases cited. Affirmance of a contract is not a waiver of the fraud and does not bar the right to recover such damages, but merely bars a subsequent rescission. Gregg v. Beezer, 142 Wash. 142, 252 Pac. 692; 17 C. J. S. 523, Contracts, \u00a7 167.\nAs we said in the case of Pronger v. Old Nat. Bank, 20 Wash. 618, 56 Pac. 391:\n\u201cThe action for damages is a law action for a money judgment, requires no tender, and may be brought by the injured party at any time within the statute of limitations. Nor does an affirmance of the contract after discovery of the fraud extinguish the right to an action for damages on account of the fraud. An affirmance bars only the right to rescind. All other remedies remain unimpaired. [Citing cases.]\u201d\nThe question of appellants\u2019 alleged fraud was therefore an important issue in this case. However, it is not necessary to discuss again all the elements which must be established to prove such a cause of action, because in this case respondent Clothier failed to prove one essential element, to wit, her consequent damage.\nIn an action for damages based upon fraud, the injured party is entitled to recover damages for losses proximately caused by the fraudulent conduct. Lawson v. Vernon, 38 Wash. 422, 80 Pac. 559; Eyers v. Burbank Co., 97 Wash. 220, 166 Pac. 656; Voellmeck v. Harding, 166 Wash. 93, 6 P. (2d) 373, 84 A. L. R. 608; Cloakey v. Bouslog, 39 Wn. (2d) 66, 234 P. (2d) 880; Salter v. Heiser, supra. However, fraud without damage or injury is not remedial. Miller v. Williamson, 128 Wash. 124, 222 Pac. 201; Godefroy v. Reilly, 140 Wash. 650, 250 Pac. 59; Kahl v. Ablan, 160 Wash. 201, 294 Pac. 1010; Salter v. Heiser, 36 Wn. (2d) 536, 219 P. (2d) 574.\nThe burden of proving damages as a proximate result of appellants\u2019 alleged failure to disclose that they had been notified by city officials (prior to the execution of the original lease) that the building could be used only for office purposes, and that substantial alterations would be required if it was to be used for other purposes, was on Ethel Clothier. The assertion by the fire chief in his letter dated March 24, 1948, that certain alterations would be required, set no time limit and threatened no abatement. It did not, in the absence of some further legal action on the part of the city, constitute an eviction of respondent or restrict her use of the premises.\nSubsequently, on January 5, 1951, the fire chief caused the notice previously mentioned to be posted on the building, purporting to restrict its use to office purposes. The final determination of the validity and legal effect of such action is a question to be determined by the courts after the presentation of appropriate evidence in a proper proceeding, because mere executive interference is not decisive of the rights of the parties. See Coffin v. Blackwell, 116 Wash. 281, 199 Pac. 239.\nRegardless of the legal effect of the fire chief\u2019s letter and his subsequent posting of the building, the evidence presented in this case is insufficient to prove damage. There is no showing here that, as the result thereof, Ethel Clothier\u2019s use of the building was actually confined to office uses or restricted in any way. She took possession of the building about March 1, 1948, subject to all existing tenancies (all of which were on a month-to-month basis). The evidence is not disputed that the existing tenants were using the premises for various commercial, manufacturing, assembly hall, and storage purposes. Following the receipt of the letter from the fire chief in April, 1948, these tenants were not disturbed in the use of their premises, and Ethel Clothier continued in possession of the entire building and conducted her dairy supply business on the first floor. Her own testimony discloses that she secured additional tenants, including two printing businesses, two photographers, a liquor manufacturer, a lithograph company, and a manufacturer of electric outlets. Some of these businesses occupied space above the second floor and were not confined to office uses.\nAfter the posting of the notice by the fire chief on January 5, 1951, respondent Clothier continued to use the building as she desired up to the time of the trial in November of that year. She made no substantial alterations at any time, terminated no tenancies but instead remained in possession and collected full rentals from all of her tenants during the entire three and one-half year period preceding the trial.\nIn support of respondent Clothier\u2019s contention that there was evidence that she suffered damage as a proximate result of appellants\u2019 alleged fraud, our attention is called to an answer, in the course of her testimony, wherein she described her efforts to rent certain vacant spaces following the earthquake damage, and volunteered: \u201cBut, due to this posting of the notice, since January 5, 1951, I have not been able to offer them to anyone.\u201d\nThis indicated only that, after the posting of the notice, she voluntarily abandoned any attempt to rent the vacant premises and did not establish that her use of the building was legally restricted in any way or that she was prevented from obtaining commercial tenants as a direct result of the posted notice.\nThe trial court erred, therefore, in overruling appellants\u2019 motion challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain Ethel Clothier\u2019s first affirmative defense and cross-complaint and in awarding her judgment for the amount of rental paid by her in excess of three hundred dollars per month since March 1, 1948.\nAppellants consented to the assignment of the lease on the condition that respondent Remmen remain as a surety for the performance of the lease and in consideration of her consent to the extension of the lease. Since the extension between appellants and respondent Clothier was made with her knowledge and consent, she was not discharged from all liability.\nThe judgment is reversed, with instructions to dismiss Ethel Clothier\u2019s cross-complaint and to enter judgment in favor of appellants and against each respondent for $4,428.24 (being the unpaid balance of rental accruing under the l\u00e9ase from March 1, 1948, to November 1, 1951), together with interest thereon at the legal rate from November 1, 1951, until paid and for attorneys\u2019 fees, as provided for in the lease, in the sum of one thousand dollars.\nIt was not necessary for the trial court to determine the liability as between respondents when he dismissed appel-l\u00e1nts\u2019 action.\nIn light of our decision to reverse that judgment, the trial court is directed to enter judgment in favor of respondent Remmen against respondent Clothier for the full amount b\u2019f the judgment recovered by appellants against respondent Remmen.\nThe new judgment shall provide that it is entered without prejudice to any cause of action which any of the parties hereto may hereafter assert against any other party concerning matters occurring or arising subsequent to November' 1, 1951, in connection with the lease involved in this case.\nMallery, Schwellenbach, Hill, Hamley, Finley, Weaver, and Olson, JJ., concur."

    "Olson, J.\nThese cases, which were tried at the same time 'and consolidated on appeal, present for determination the rights of the parties under this renewal provision of a lease of real property:\n\u201cPermission is hereby granted for the renewal of this lease upon its expiration, on terms to be agreed upon at that time.\u201d\nVi Finch leased retail, store space, in the city of Auburn, from the lodge for a term of five years, commencing June 1, 1946, at a monthly rental of seventy-five dollars. A printed form of lease, with typewritten additions including the quoted provision, was used to express the agreement of the parties.\nBefore the expiration of the term, the tenant notified her landlord that she had elected to renew the lease. The landlord insisted that the renewal provision was not en-forcible, and that she would be required to vacate the premises when the term expired. Negotiations failed to reconcile these divergent views, and she brought a timely action against the landlord to compel specific performance of the renewal provision.\nThe landlord commenced an action based upon the tenant\u2019s alleged unlawful detention of the premises after the expiration of the term. It was submitted to the trial judge, who heard both actions at the same time, upon the evidence presented in the tenant\u2019s action, which was considered first. The decision of either case necessarily is conclusive upon the issues in both cases.\nThe tenant prevailed in her action, upon findings by the trial court that the wording of the provision renders it enforcible for a renewal period of five years, subject only to a determination by the court of the reasonable rental for the renewal term. Consequently, the unlawful detainer action was dismissed.\nThis consolidated appeal raises two questions, namely, the enforcibility of the renewal clause, and the reasonableness of the rental determined by the trial court.\nThe landlord contends (1) that the renewal clause is incomplete, in that it provides no standard, criterion or formula by which to fix the \u201cterms\u201d of the renewal, and leaves open for agreement the entire subject matter of a new lease between the parties, and (2) that courts will not make agreements for parties, nor will they enforce alleged agreements which are indefinite, uncertain, and incomplete.\nThe tenant does not dispute the latter of these contentions, but she urges that the first is not tenable in view of the previous decisions of this court. She argues that the use of the words, \u201cthis lease,\u201d in the disputed provision, indicates the intention of the parties that the word \u201cterms\u201d meant only rental. In effect, she argues that the words, \u201cthe renewal of this lease,\u201d should receive a broad construction, as words granting the renewal of the lease upon terms identical with the old, except for rental, and that the phrase, \u201cterms to be agreed upon,\u201d limits the earlier phrase of grant and should receive a narrow construction. She contends that, when the parties are unable to agree, the court can and must determine the reasonable rental for the renewal term. For her to succeed in this case, and to bring it within the scope of our decisions, \u201cterms\u201d must be taken to mean \u201crental.\u201d\nIn each of our previous decisions upon this question, Anderson v. Frye & Bruhn, 69 Wash. 89, 124 Pac. 499 (1912), Faucett v. Northern Clay Co., 84 Wash. 382, 146 Pac. 857 (1915), Young v. Nelson, 121 Wash. 285, 209 Pac. 515 (1922), 30 A. L. R. 568, Diettrich v. J. J. Newberry Co., 172 Wash. 18, 19 P. (2d) 115 (1933), and Blume v. Bohanna, 38 Wn. (2d) 199, 228 P. (2d) 146 (1951), by the provisions of the document itself, only one specific term \u25a0 of the renewal, usually rental, was open for agreement by the parties. In the Faucett case, the written agreement provided a definite and binding way to make certain the rental, although the length of the term of the renewal was not made certain and was settled by the court. None of these cases is in point in this case, and it is not necessary for us to discuss them or their rationale. In the case at bar, the renewal clause leaves all \u201cterms\u201d open for agreement by the parties.\nRental is but one of \u201cthe terms\u201d (or provisions) of a lease. To accept the tenant\u2019s contention that \u201cterms\u201d means rental only, we must restrict the meaning of the word to one term (or provision), and further narrow it to the one term (or provision) selected by the tenant. Applying any rule of construction or definition of the word \u201cterms\u201d which has been cited to us or which we have been able to find, does not permit us to reach this conclusion. In fact, there is no room for construction when plain and unambiguous words are used by the parties themselves. Hamilton Trucking Service v. Automobile Ins. Co. of Hartford, 39 Wn. (2d) 688, 237 P. (2d) 781 (1951). See Blume v. Bohanna, supra, p. 202, and case cited, also Bellingham Securities Syndicate v. Bellingham Coal Mines, 13 Wn. (2d) 370, 384, 125 P. (2d) 668 (1942). The words need only be taken in their common and accepted meaning, and, so taken, we must conclude that the words used here do not bring this case within the scope of our previous decisions, which express, as counsel concede, a minority rule. To conclude that this case is governed by that rule would result in the assumption by the courts of the power to make contracts, in addition to their duty to enforce them. The latter is our only proper province, and we cannot undertake the former. See Keys v. Klitten, 21 Wn. (2d) 504, 520, 151 P. (2d) 989 (1944), cited in KVI, Inc. v. Doernbecher, 24 Wn.

(2d) 194 (1946), and cases cited.\nThe tenant, not being entitled to prevail in her action for specific performance, unlawfully detained the premises, after the expiration of the term of her lease. The trial court found that, if the landlord\u2019s appeal brought that result, damages should be assessed against her in the sum of one hundred fifty dollars per month for the period of her unlawful detention, which sum should be doubled under the unlawful detainer statutes, and that the landlord should be granted restitution of the premises. ROW 59.12.170 [cf. Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 827]. The amount of damages so found is based upon the trial court\u2019s finding of the reasonable rental value of the premises, which was made and entered in an action at law, the unlawful detainer case, upon conflicting evidence. The evidence does not clearly preponderate against it, and we will not disturb it. Batcheller v. Westport, 39 Wn. (2d) 338, 351, 235 P. (2d) 471 (1951).\nThe judgments of the trial court in both cases are reversed, and it is directed to enter judgment in each case in accordance with this opinion.\nSchwellenbach, C. J., Mallery,.

    "Hill, C. J.\nThe important issues in this case are:\n(1) . Does the use, in an apartment house, of porcelain faucet handles, in which no defect is apparent in and of itself, establish liability of the owner and operator to a tenant who is injured when such a faucet handle breaks, on the theory of: (a) breach of an implied warranty of fitness; or (b) wanton misconduct; or (c) negligence.\n(2) . Does the fact that the owner and operator of an apartment house has knowledge of two people having been injured by the breaking of porcelain faucet handles, the two injuries being separated by some ten years, and that he knows or should knqw that their manufacture has been discontinued, constitute sufficient evidence of his knowledge that porcelain faucet handles are a dangerous instrumentality (assuming that there is evidence that they are a dangerous instrumentality) to take the issues of wanton misconduct or negligence to a jury?\nPlaintiff, Harry R. Bidlake, sustained serious injuries in consequence of the breaking of a porcelain handle on the kitchen faucet in the bachelor apartment he occupied in a building owned and operated by the defendant, Youell, Inc. Seeking damages for injuries sustained, he sued Youell, Inc., Thomas Youell, who supervised the operation of the apartment house, and Ruth Wilson Seckel, its resident manager, setting forth three causes of action based on the theories indicated supra.\nAt the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the trial court took the case from the jury and entered an order dismissing all the causes of action. From this order, the plaintiff appeals.\nWe assume the existence of a landlord and tenant relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant Youell, Inc. The plaintiff urges that he was a guest in a hotel room, and that the relationship was not that of landlord and tenant.\nThe evidence on the question of status is that, while some transient guests were from time to time accommodated in the building where the plaintiff was living, it was always under special circumstances and not as a practice or policy. The plaintiff paid his rent in advance on a month-to-month basis and understood that he had to give a thirty-day notice of termination. There were cooking facilities, including a stove and a refrigerator; linens, dishes, and silverware were also furnished. Maid service was available at an additional charge. Plaintiff availed himself of the maid service, on an hourly basis, at least once a week and sometimes oftener.\nIt was agreed by both parties that the relationship was not an issue of fact, but of law, and the trial court decided and, if it be material, we believe correctly, that the plaintiff occupied an apartment and that the relationship was that of landlord and tenant.\nConcerning the theory of the implied warranty of fitness, the trial court in its well-reasoned and comprehensive oral opinion said:\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that the Supreme Court has laid down a doctrine of implied warranty of fitness in cases where there is no negligence, that is, as applying to a landlord and tenant relationship. I am satisfied that the consequences of such a doctrine would be very far-reaching. If the Court should now announce and it should be affirmed by the Supreme Court I think that it would be the practical result of imposing an unforseen and unforseeable liability on the part of many people after their positions have been committed without any possibility of defense against such liability. It is all right for the legislature to declare a new policy and new duties and a new liability as to transactions in the future, but when a court undertakes to lay down a new rule of liability it does it with retrospect in the specific case and sometimes the consequences are very unwise.\u201d\nWe have limited the theory of implied warranty of fitness or suitability to sales of personal property, including food and, under certain circumstances, raiment. As between a tenant and a landlord, where there is no fraud or false representation and no express warranty or covenant, we have rejected the theory of an implied warranty. Conradi v. Arnold (1949), 34 Wn. (2d) 730, 209 P. (2d) 491.\nThe opinion in Forrester v. Hoover Hotel & Investment Co. (1948), 87 Cal. App. (2d) 226, 231, 196 P. (2d) 825, uses language which is very apropos of the present situation:\n\u201cWe are persuaded that to hold the landlord liable upon warranty for any injury resulting from a latent defect in the equipment or furnishings leased with a furnished apartment would be to make the landlord virtually an insurer of the safety of the tenant. We are satisfied that the correct rule, supported in this state by a long line of decisions, is that a landlord is not liable to the tenant for injuries due to a defective condition or faulty construction of the demised premises, in the absence of fraud, concealment or covenant in the lease (Shotwell v. Bloom, 60 Cal. App. 2d 303, 309 [140 P.2d 728]; Colburn v. Shuravlev, 24 Cal. App. 2d 298, 299 [74 P.2d 1060]).\u201d\nOf the theory of wanton misconduct, the trial court said: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any case based on wantonness. I just don\u2019t see the merit of that point.\u201d\nWanton misconduct is positive in nature; it is such as puts the-actor in the class with the willful wrongdoer. Adkisson v. Seattle (1953), 42 Wn. (2d) 676, 258 P. (2d) 461. To constitute a willful and wanton injury, the act which produced it must have been knowingly and intentionally committed, or it must have been committed under such circumstances as to evince a reckless disregard of the safety of the person injured. Price v. Gabel (1931), 162 Wash. 275, 298 Pac. 444.\nIt is true that metal has very generally replaced porcelain as faucet handles, but, as the evidence indicates and it is common knowledge, porcelain handles are still frequently used in older homes, apartments, and hotels, and have been used throughout the years without fear of possible harmful consequences. Unless it could be found that defendants knew, or should have known, that there was a high degree of probability that substantial bodily harm would result to another from the use of a porcelain faucet handle, there can be no recovery on the theory of wanton misconduct. Adkisson v. Seattle, supra. We find no evidence to support such a finding.\nWe turn now to the theory of negligence. There is no evidence or even contention that any amount of inspection would have revealed any defect in the porcelain faucet handle which broke. The plaintiff\u2019s case, on the theory of negligence, must rest on the twofold proposition that it was unreasonably dangerous to use a porcelain faucet handle, and that one or more of the defendants knew it to be so.\nOn this phase of the case, the trial court said:\n\u201c1 do think that the evidence warrants the conclusion, would warrant a jury in finding, if that issue were submitted, that the landlord assumed the duty to repair. If that was the duty, then it must be discharged with reasonable care. I don\u2019t find any evidence of a failure to discharge the duty to repair, so far as the plaintiff is concerned. All the evidence is that the handle which broke had no apparent defect in it. The break was a clean one. No evidence of any pre-existing crack. Let us assume that it was the duty of the defendant to send its maintenance man into this particular apartment and inspect it on the day in question before the accident happened. If he had looked at this handle ahead of time there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that he would have found anything to repair. The only claim that can be made is that he would have seen that it was a porcelain handle, that he should have known what the plumbing manufacturing industry knew, that these things sometime break, and if they break an accident could happen, and therefore, should have changed it at that moment. The plaintiff is almost in that position. Of course, the timing wouldn\u2019t be so specific, but the plaintiff\u2019s argument is that since the porcelain handles were not on the market it should have known what the plumbing industry knew when it decided to quit manufacturing. It is almost that blunt, and I don\u2019t think that the apartment house industry or the construction industry is chargeable with that much knowledge, particularly an apartment house operator. The evidence is undisputed that at the time this place was built porcelain handles were accepted practice. There is no evidence that there is any widespread effort to take them out where they have been installed nor any educational program to dissuade their use.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how we can say that a jury would be. warranted on this evidence in finding that the defendants failed to exercise ordinary care under the circumstances. The evidence of the Kuney accident, which comes from a disinterested witness and is therefore binding on both parties, is that he made no claim of negligence on the part of the defendants at that time, and that handle admittedly broke when it was struck, and that was demonstrated to the jury. It was struck with the hand. And it is the only accident shown to have occurred in connection with the broken faucet handle in the defendant\u2019s apartment over a long period of years. And there are a large number of handles involved, something like one hundred and sixty-odd units with anywhere from six to eight porcelain handles in each apartment unit. That is very close to a thousand handles. And over a period of years only two accidents, the first one is when it was struck.\n\u201cNow, assume that the jury could find only normal pressure was applied. There is a dispute in the case on that. But assume that the jury should find that way, still they don\u2019t have any right, I think, to find that there was such notice of this danger to the defendants before this accident that there was a duty upon them to replace all handles, and I think you pretty near have to find such a duty before you can find liability here.\u201d\nWe agree with the trial court that the plaintiff failed to furnish sufficient evidence to sustain a finding by the jury that any of the defendants knew that it was unreasonably dangerous to use porcelain faucet handles, assuming that they are a dangerous instrumentality.\nThe case of Doherty v. Arcade Hotel (1943), 170 Ore. 374, 134 P. (2d) 118 is squarely in point, and there it is said:\n\u201cThe basic facts upon which the plaintiff depends are that porcelain handles were obsolete when the injury occurred and that safer equipment was available.\n\u201cThe march of science and art and the development of modern improvements bring in their wake negligence litigation based upon contentions similar to the one now before us.\n\u201cA finding of negligence could be warranted only in the event that the evidence shows that a reasonably prudent hotelkeeper, in an endeavor to take due precautions for his guests\u2019 safety, would have known that the use of porcelain handles unreasonably subjected his guests to' danger and that metal handles were not only available but also safer.\n\u201cWe remind ourselves that (1) the handle which injured the plaintiff was, so far as porcelain handles are concerned, .of standard make and design; (2) no finding is warranted that it displayed any indications whatever of an impending fracture; (3) there is no evidence that anyone outside of the plumbing industry and those injured by the breakings knew that porcelain handles acted in the manner described by the four aforementioned plumbers; (4) at least one other hotel in Klamath Falls, the Willard, (larger than the defendant\u2019s), used porcelain handles; and (5) the plaintiff\u2019s brief does not contend that the defendant failed to inspect properly the equipment of its rooms.\n\u201cFrom the evidence before us, it is apparent that porcelain handles are in common use. One of the handles is before us as an exhibit. Of itself, it looks harmless. Undoubtedly our \u2022hands and those of every adult person have touched hundreds of them. It comes as a shock to be told that we have been so many times unwittingly subjected to danger. U\n\u201cWe do not believe that the record contains any evidence showing that common experience condemned porcelain handles as dangerous.\n\u201c9. Since the defendant had no express knowledge that porcelain handles were dangerous, and since the evidence failed to indicate that common experience showed them to be dangerous, the charge made in the complaint that the defendant was negligent was not supported by substantial evidence. The record does not warrant a finding that the defendant should have replaced its porcelain handles with metal ones. It, therefore, follows that the motion for a directed verdict should have been allowed. For that reason, the judgment of the circuit court is reversed.\u201d\nThe plaintiff places great reliance on Cottmire v. 181 East Lake Shore Drive Hotel Corp. (1947), 330 Ill. App. 549, 71 N. E. (2d) 823, which is an innkeeper and guest case. But even so, the requirements of notice and knowledge on the part of the innkeeper, which the Illinois court indicated were requisite to a recovery by the guest, have not been met by the evidence offered by the plaintiff in this case.\nThe plaintiff further urges that RCW 4.44.050 makes mandatory the entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which the judgment of dismissal is based.\nThis being a jury case, the test to be applied in examining the judgment of dismissal is whether there is any evidence or reasonable inference from evidence which will sustain plaintiff\u2019s case. Pearsall v. Paltas (1955), 48 Wn. (2d) 78, 291 P. (2d) 414; Gentry v. Greyhound Corp. (1955), 46 Wn. (2d) 631, 283 P. (2d) 979.\nThe trial court, in granting the judgment of dismissal, was not weighing the evidence. It recognized that the evidence was conflicting on certain issues, but its position was that, assuming the truth of all the evidence offered favorable to the plaintiff, there was no evidence from which the jury could have found that any of the defendants knew or should have known that it was dangerous to use porcelain faucet handles. If there was not sufficient evidence to take that issue to the jury, there could be, as a matter of law, no finding of either negligence or wanton misconduct. It was, of course, patent that the holding with respect to any implied warranty of fitness determined an issue of law.\nWhere, as here, the trial court treated the plaintiff\u2019s evidence as true and held, as a matter of law, that plaintiff has not established a prima facie case, findings of fact are unnecessary. Richards v. Kuppinqer (1955), 46 Wn. (2d) 62, 278 P. (2d) 395.\nThe injuries sustained by the plaintiff were serious, and their treatment and care were expensive. We may assume, as he testified, that he was in no way to blame for the breaking of the porcelain faucet handle.\nThe trial court could not find, nor can we, any evidence of fault or negligence on the part of the defendants.\nIt may well be that the owner of the apartment is better able to sustain the monetary loss involved than is the plaintiff, but we are not justified in imposing liability without fault by an extension of the theory of an implied warranty of fitness to the landlord-tenant relationship; that, as the trial court suggests, involves a question of public policy for the legislature.\nThe judgment of dismissal, as to all causes of action, is affirmed.\nDonworth, Rosellini, and Foster, JJ., concur.\nNovember 23, 1957. Petition for rehearing denied."

    "Hill, J.\nThis action was brought under the Federal housing and rent act of 1947 as amended (50 U.S.C.A. Appendix, \u00a7\u00a7 1881-1884, 1891-1906) and the regulations issued thereunder, to recover three times the amount of certain rental overcharges, to secure the return of a lease deposit in the amount of one hundred sixty dollars, and for an attorney\u2019s fee of two hundred dollars. An action of this character can be maintained against the person who \u201cretains\u201d any payment of rent in excess of the maximum prescribed. 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix, \u00a7 1895.\nThe overcharges amounted to twenty dollars a month for twelve months (two hundred forty dollars) and were not seriously contested.\nThe overcharge being established, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover three times the amount thereof unless the defendants proved that the overcharge, or the retention thereof, was neither willful nor the result of failure to take \u201cpracticable precautions\u201d against the occurrence thereof. Shuh v. Oakes (1951), 38 Wn. (2d) 336, 229 P. (2d) 507.\nThe defendants urge that the overcharge and the retention thereof were not willful and the damages should not be trebled; and that the plaintiffs committed waste and damaged the premises in five particulars, to the property owners\u2019 damage in the amount of $362.78. The defendants\u2019 claims about the condition in which the plaintiffs left the property when they surrendered possession are particularly important, not only on the issue of damages, but also on the issue of justification of the defendants\u2019 failure to reimburse the plaintiffs for the overcharges in accordance with the order relating thereto.\nThe defendants, as lessors, and the plaintiffs, as lessees, entered into a lease for a period of three years from August 10, 1950, covering a dwelling house known as 4736-% University way, in Seattle. We quote the following provision from the lease, inasmuch as the right to the last two months\u2019 rent, which was paid in advance, is one of the issues in the case: \u201cReceipt is hereby acknowledged of Two Hundred and forty dollars, being the first and last two months [rent].\u201d\nThe plaintiffs remained in possession until September 20, 1951, paying the rent for each month except the month of September, 1951. When it became necessary for them to move from Seattle, they asked and received permission to sublease the premises but were unsuccessful in their efforts so to do. Mr. Largent then agreed to release them from their obligations under the lease and to accept surrender of the premises, but refused to return any part of the last two months\u2019 rental that had been paid in advance. He immediately rented the premises, effective October 1, 1951, to another tenant, also at the rate of eighty dollars a month.\nMr. Largent, a real-estate broker of many years\u2019 experience (but retired when the case was tried), had registered all of his property used for dwelling purposes when the act in question became effective in the Seattle area. He had not registered the premises at 4736-% University way at that time because they were then rented as business property. He testified that he \u201coverlooked\u201d registering the property when he leased it to the plaintiffs as a dwelling in August, 1950; nor did he register it during the period of their occupancy. He first registered the property on October 16, 1951, giving the name of the then-tenant, R. Salonen, and indicating that it was first rented on October 1,1951, thus failing to disclose the prior lease to the plaintiffs and their occupancy of the premises as a dwelling for more than thirteen months. This, together with his extensive experience as a real-estate broker, was unquestionably a factor in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that he had acted willfully in failing to register the premises as he should have done in August, 1950.\nOn May 29, 1952, the area rental director issued an order fixing the maximum rental of the premises at sixty dollars a month, effective as of September 10, 1950, and directing the refund, within thirty days, of any rent collected in excess of that amount. On June 2, 1952, Mr. Largent wrote the plaintiffs expressing his willingness to make reimbursement for the rental overcharges but asserting that the plaintiffs owed him a considerable amount for damages to the premises and the expenses he had incurred in making the place habitable again, and suggesting that they or their attorney discuss the matter with him or his attorney. The plaintiffs elected to discuss the matter in court, and commenced this action July 22, 1952.\nThe one item of damage to the defendants\u2019 property conceded by the plaintiffs was \u201cabout a dozen dart holes\u201d in a bedroom door. No evidence was offered as to the amount of the damage to the door.\nThe defendants failed to call as a witness the person to whom Mr. Largent testified he had paid sixty-five dollars for cleaning the premises and who should have been in a position to corroborate Mr. Largent\u2019s testimony as to the claimed deplorable condition of the premises when the plaintiffs surrendered possession. The defendants were, therefore, in no position to complain when the trial court elected to believe the plaintiffs instead of Mr. Largent and found against the defendants on each of the five items of damage alleged in their cross-complaint. The trial court concluded that the defendants\u2019 urging of those items of damage as the basis for the adjustment of the rental overcharges was \u201cspecious and unfounded.\u201d\nWith some travail of mind and spirit, we have recognized that our courts have no discretion in the matter of entertaining actions for damages under the Federal statutes with which we are here concerned, and little discretion in the consideration of treble damages when an overcharge is established. Walker v. Gilman (1946), 25 Wn. (2d) 557, 171 P. (2d) 797. Being convinced that Mr. Largent\u2019s failure to register the premises was willful, and that his excuses for not refunding the amount of the overcharges as directed were \u201cspecious and unfounded,\u201d the trial court was obligated to award treble damages. Shuh v. Oakes, supra; Walker v. Gilman, supra; Gutman v. Lawton Estates (1952), 102 F. Supp. 724.\nTo this point, the issues seem- purely factual. The right of the lessors to retain the rent paid in advance, even though they consented to a termination of the lease, presents a legal question.\nThe general rule is that the right and title to advance rentals passes to the lessor on .the payment thereof, and the lessee can derive further benefit therefrom only by occupying the premises during the period or which the rent is paid. Sanders v. General Petroleum Corp. (1933), 171 Wash. 250,17 P. (2d) 890; General Petroleum Corp. v. Harry Wright\u2019s, Inc. (1932), 166 Wash. 636, 8 P. (2d) 291, 13 P. (2d) 1080; Rockwell v. Eiler\u2019s Music House (1912), 67 Wash. 478, 122 Pac. 12, 39 L. R. A. (N.S.) 894; Dutton v. Christie (1911), 63 Wash. 372, 115 Pac. 856.\nThe plaintiffs, in support of their contention that one hundred dollars (the one hundred sixty dollars paid at the time the lease was executed, for the last two months\u2019 rental under the lease, less the sixty dollars the plaintiffs owed the defendants for the September, 1951, rental) should be returned to them, cite Stern v. Green (1923), 127 Wash. 429, 221 Pac. 601. That is a lease-deposit case, and there is a \u201cmanifest difference\u201d between a lease deposit and a payment of rental in advance. See Dutton v. Christie, supra.\nUnfortunately for the defendants, however, they could not \u201cdemand, receive or retain\u201d any \u201cprepayment of rent except payment in advance of the next periodic installment of rent for a period ... no longer than one month.\u201d This is by reason of a regulation adopted under the Federal housing and rent act of 1947 as amended. 24 C. F. R. (1949 ed.) \u00a7 825.2(c). (Plaintiffs referred to 16 Fed. Reg. 12882, \u00a7 73, dated December 22, 1951. Not liking ex post facto regulations, we checked further and found the same regulation, cited above, in effect on August 10, 1950.)\nWe are of the opinion that the trial court did not err in crediting to the rental due for September, 1951, sixty of the one hundred sixty dollars paid in advance by the plaintiffs, and in giving the plaintiffs judgment for the remaining one hundred dollars.\nThe trial court allowed two hundred fifty dollars for the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2019s fee. We agree with the defendants that the allowance for that purpose should be reduced to two hundred dollars, that being the amount prayed for in the complaint. The plaintiffs place emphasis upon the fact that the attorney for the defendants agreed that the court might fix the attorney\u2019s fee if the plaintiffs were entitled to recover one. However, such an agreement was to avoid the necessity of calling witnesses on the issue of the amount of the fee, and the concession by the attorney for the defendants was unquestionably limited to the amount prayed for in the complaint.\nThe plaintiffs ask for additional attorney\u2019s fees in this court and point out that 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix, \u00a7 1895, provides that the person making an overcharge shall be liable to the person from whom the overcharge is received or retained \u201cfor reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs as determined by the court\u201d (italics ours), in addition to three times the amount of the overcharge.\nOur construction of the language used would limit \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d to those fixed by the trial court. It has been our policy not to fix attorneys\u2019 fees for services in this court, even under statutes much more explicit than that now under consideration. See Franklin v. Fischer (1949), 34 Wn. (2d) 342, 208 P. (2d) 902; Flint v. Bronson (1939), 197 Wash. 686, 86 P. (2d) 218. However, several Federal courts and a few state courts have held to the contrary. It is conceded that the determination of additional \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d for services in this court is discretionary. We shall exercise that discretion rather than engage in a dialectical discussion of what courts Congress had in mind when it used the phrase \u201cdetermined by the court.\u201d\nUnder all of the circumstances of the case, we are of the view that additional attorney\u2019s fees are not warranted for the services rendered in this court, other than the statutory attorney\u2019s fee allowed to the prevailing party. See Griffith v. Norman (1948), 170 F. (2d) 745.\nThe judgment is affirmed as to the award of treble the amount of the overcharges, as is the dismissal with prejudice of the defendants\u2019 cross-appeal. As to the award of one hundred dollars, reimbursement for advance rentals, the judgment is likewise affirmed. As to the allowance for an attorney\u2019s fee in the superior court, the judgment is reduced from two hundred fifty to two hundred dollars.\nThe respondents, having prevailed on the major issues on this appeal, will recover their costs.\nHamley, C. J., Schwellenbach, Weaver, and Rosellini, JJ., concur."

    "Per Curiam.\nThe appellant has for some twenty years been paying to the respondents an annual rental of eighteen thousand dollars on a certain leasehold in the city of Seattle. The lease was for ninety-nine years and was executed in 1927. It called for a rental of twenty-seven thousand dollars a year for the first fifteen years and thirty-six thousand dollars a year for the remainder of the term. As modified in 1932, it provided for a rental of eighteen thousand dollars a year from November 1, 1932, to April 30, 1943. After April 30, 1943, the rental was to be based upon the actual value of the leasehold. Every five years there was to be an appraisal of the leasehold, and the annual rental for the ensuing five years was to be five and one-half per cent of the amount shown by such appraisal, with a minimum of eighteen thousand dollars and a maximum of thirty-six thousand dollars a year. The lessee was to nominate the first appraiser not more than one hundred eighty days and not less than ninety days prior to the beginning of each such five-year period. The lessors were to nominate a second appraiser within fifteen days after receipt of notice of the nomination of the first one, and the two appraisers thus selected were to select a third. The provision relative to the .appointment of the appraisers contained the following clause:\n\u201cIf the Lessee shall fail to so nominate such appraiser it shall pay rent for said premises during such five-year period at the rate of Thirty-six Thousand Dollars ($36,000) per annum.\u201d\nFor the five-year periods beginning May 1, 1943, and May 1, 1948, the parties mutually, in writing, waived the appraisals and agreed upon a rental of eighteen thousand dollars.\nThe appellant failed to nominate an appraiser for the five-year period beginning May 1, 1953, until May 5, 1953, some ninety-five days after the, time alio wed by the lease as modified, and the respondents are insisting that they are entitled to thirty-six thousand dollars a year for that five-year period. The appellant urges that it has a right to have the rental fixed by an appraisal. Appellant tendered fifteen hundred dollars a month pending an appraisal. The respondents started this action to recover the stipulated rental of thirty-six thousand dollars, payable three thousand dollars a month, and the trial court held that they are entitled to that amount for each month of the five-year period which began May 1, 1953.\nWhile the amounts involved are large, we find no merit in any of the reasons urged by the appellant as to why it should not be bound by the clear and unambiguous language of its agreement. The language is clearly mandatory, and the provision for a rental of thirty-six thousand dollars a year is not a penalty. The facts do not establish the necessary elements of an estoppel or waiver. A discussion of the circumstances which resulted in appellant\u2019s failure to nominate an appraiser, within the time limit set by the lease is unnecessary; if a mistake was made it was clearly unilateral, and we find nothing in the circumstances which should challenge the conscience of a court of equity and quicken it to action on behalf of the appellant. However long the discussion of these contentions might be, the inescapable conclusion is that appellant is bound by the terms of the lease as modified.\nBy the terms of the lease, the respondents are entitled to an attorney\u2019s fee. Two witnesses were called by the respondents on this phase of the case. Their testimony fixed twelve thousand five hundred or thirteen thousand five hundred dollars as a reasonable fee under the circumstances. Although appellant\n\u201c. . . cannot believe that plaintiffs\u2019 [respondents\u2019] counsel, or any other attorneys practicing in the City of Seattle or the State of Washington, would think of submitting a bill of $10,000.00 to these plaintiffs,\u201d\nit offered no evidence on the amount of attorney\u2019s fees.\nAlthough the respondents will receive ninety thousand dollars more rent during the five-year period ending April 30, 1958, than they received for the five-year period ended April 30, 1953, appellant urges that only forty thousand dollars is involved. It bases this figure upon the fact that one of the respondents testified that it was his judgment that a rental based upon a current appraisal as of May 1, 1953, would amount to twenty-eight thousand dollars a year. That is hardly a fair argument, as the appellant at no time offered to pay rental on that basis or conceded that it would be that amount if based upon an appraisal. The rent appellant tendered the respondents for May, 1953, the first month of the new five-year period, before any issue was raised, was still on the basis of eighteen thousand dollars a year. We see no reason for it to minimize the amount involved.\nWe cannot say that the problems presented to respondents\u2019 counsel were unusual or extremely difficult, as we have already indicated that we can see no merit in any of appellant\u2019s contentions; nonetheless, the appellant forced the respondents to bring this suit to collect the rent due under the lease, and has thought its contentions sufficiently meritorious to appeal an adverse judgment to this court.\nOur own views are that the fee is generous but in no sense an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.\nThe respondents cite only a lien foreclosure case construing a statute authorizing attorney\u2019s fees on an appeal as authority for their contention that they are entitled to an additional attorney\u2019s fee (other than the statutory one) to be fixed by the superior court for their services on this appeal. We know of no basis for such an allowance. See Franklin v. Fischer, 34 Wn. (2d) 342, 208 P. (2d) 902 (1949).\nJudgment affirmed."

    "Stafford, J.\nThe two cases involved herein were considered separately by the trial court. Since the issues presented are identical, they have been consolidated on appeal.\nPlaintiff Norma McCutcheon, a tenant of defendant United Homes Corporation, was injured one evening when she fell down an unlighted flight of stairs leading from her apartment. She alleged the defendant was negligent because the lights 'at the top and bottom of the stairwell were not operative.\nPlaintiff Douglas R. Fuller, also defendant\u2019s tenant, was injured as he descended the outside stairs of his apartment on his way to work. A step pulled loose causing him to fall. He, too, alleged negligence on the part of defendant.\nDefendant\u2019s answer alleged each plaintiff had executed a form \u201cMonth to Month Rental Agreement\u201d which contained the following exculpatory clause:\nneither the Lessor, nor his Agent, shall be liable for any . injury to Lessee, his family, guests or employees or any other person entering the premises or the building of which the demised premises are a part.\nIn each case the trial court granted a summary judgment of dismissal.\nThe question is one of first impression. The issue is whether the lessor of a residential unit within a multi-fam-ily dwelling complex may exculpate itself from liability for personal injuries sustained by a tenant, which injuries result from the lessor\u2019s own negligence in maintenance of the approaches, common passageways, stairways and other areas under the lessor\u2019s dominion and control, but available for the tenants\u2019 use. (Hereinafter called the \u201ccommon areas\u201d.)\nBasic to the entire discussion is the common law rule that one who leases a portion of his premises but retains control over the approaches, common passageways, stairways and other areas to be used in common by the owner and tenants, has a duty to use reasonable care to keep them in safe condition for use of the tenant in his enjoyment of the demised premises. Schedler v. Wagner, 37 Wn.2d 612, 225 P.2d 213, 230 P.2d 600 (1950); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 360, at 250 (1965). The landlord is required t\u00f3 do more than passively refrain from negligent acts. He has a duty of affirmative conduct, an affirmative obligation to exercise reasonable care to inspect and' repair the previously mentioned portions of the premises for protection of the lessee. W. Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts \u00a7 38, at 183, \u00a7 80, at 471 (2d ed. 1955); F. Harper, A Treatise on the Law of Torts \u00a7 68, at 158, \u00a7 79, at 197, \u00a7 82, at 207, \u00a7 103, at 236 (1933); F. Harper and F. James, 2 The Law of Torts \u00a7 27.17, at 1516 etseq. (1956).\nIt is readily apparent that the exculpatory clause was inserted in defendant\u2019s form \u201cMonth to Month Rental Agreement\u201d to bar its tenants from asserting actions for personal injuries sustained through the landlord\u2019s own negligence. It was adopted to negative the result of the lessor\u2019s failure to comply with its affirmative duty to the tenants.\nThe defendant asserts that a lessor may contract, in a rental agreement, to exculpate itself from liability to its lessee, for personal injuries caused by lessor\u2019s own negligence. 49 Am. Jur. 2d Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 869, at 837 (1970). It contends such exculpatory clauses are not contrary to public policy because the landlord-tenant relationship is not a matter of public interest, but relates exclusively to the private affairs of the parties concerned and that the two parties stand upon equal terms. Thus, there should be full freedom to contract. 49 Am. Jur. 2d Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 870, at 839 (1970); Annot., 175 A.L.R. 8, 86 (1948). Defendant suggests there is additional case support in this jurisdiction by citing Broderson v. Rainier Nat\u2019l Park Co., 187 Wash. 399, 60 P.2d 234 (1936) and Griffiths v. Broderick, Inc., 27 Wn.2d 901, 182 P.2d 18, 175 A.L.R. 1 (1947).\nThe impact of Broderson and Griffiths shall be dealt with summarily. Broderson was overruled by this court subsequent to the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in this case. See Baker v. Seattle, 79 Wn.2d 198, 484 P.2d 405 (1971). Griffiths deals strictly with the validity of a contract of indemnity and is not in point.\nThe importance of \u201cfreedom of contract\u201d is clear enough. However, the use of such an argument for avoiding the affirmative duty of a landlord to its residential tenant is no longer compelling in light of today\u2019s multifamily dwelling complex wherein a tenant merely rents some space with appurtenant rights to make it more usable or livable. Under modern circumstances the tenant is almost wholly dependent upon the landlord to provide reasonably for his safe use of the \u201ccommon areas\u201d beyond the four walls demised to him. Quinn and Phillips, The Law of Landlord-Tenant, 38 Fordham L. Rev. 225, 231 (1969).\nAs early as 1938 Williston recognized that while such exculpatory clauses were recognized as \u201clegal\u201d, many courts had shown a reluctance to enforce them. Even then, courts were disposed to interpret them strictly so they would not be effective to discharge liability for the consequences of negligence in making or failing to make repairs. 6 Williston, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 1751C, at 4968 (Rev. ed. 1938). In \u00a7 1751B, at 4965, the author said:\nA promise not to sue for the future damage caused by simple negligence may be valid. Such bargains are not favored, however, and, if possible, bargains are construed not to confer this immunity.\n(Footnotes omitted. Italics ours.)\nThe key to our problem is found in Restatement of Contracts \u00a7 574, at 1079 (1932) which reads:\nA bargain for exemption from liability for the consequences of negligence not falling greatly below the standard established by law for the protection of others against unreasonable risk of harm, is legal . . .\n(Italics ours.) In other words, such an exculpatory clause may be legal, when considered in the abstract. However, when applied to a specific situation, one may be exempt from liability for his own negligence only when the consequences thereof do not fall greatly below the standard established by law.\nIn the landlord-tenant relationship it is extremely meaningful to require that a landlord\u2019s attempt to exculpate itself, from liability for the result of its own negligence, not fall greatly below the standard of negligence set by law. As indicated earlier, a residential tenant who lives in a modem multi-family dwelling complex is almost wholly dependent upon the landlord for the reasonably safe condition of the \u201ccommon areas\u201d. However, a clause which exculpates the lessor from liability to its lessee, for personal injuries caused by lessor\u2019s own acts of negligence, not only lowers the standard imposed by the common law, it effectively destroys the landlord\u2019s affirmative obligation or duty to keep or maintain the \u201ccommon areas\u201d in a reasonably safe condition for the tenant\u2019s use.\nWhen a lessor is no longer liable for the failure to observe standards of affirmative conduct, or for any conduct amounting to negligence, by virtue of an exculpatory clause in a lease, the standard ceases to exist. In short, such a clause destroys the concept of negligence in the landlord-tenant relationship. Neither the standard nor negligence can exist in abstraction.\nIt- is no answer to argue that the rental agreement relates exclusively to the \u201cpersonal and private affairs of two parties on equal footing\u201d and thus is \u201cnot a matter of public interest.\u201d Such a concept had its origin in contracts entered into between indemnitors and indemnitees. Woodbury v. Post, 158 Mass. 140, 33 N.E. 86 (1893); Perry v. Payne, 217 Pa. 252, 66 A. 553 (1907). The theory was first carried from indemnity contracts into the landlord-tenant relationship by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s rather cursory consideration of mere dicta in Perry v. Payne, supra. In Cannon v. Bresch, 307 Pa. 31, 35, 160 A. 595 (1932), the court first used the language now relied on by defendant, applying it to an exculpatory clause concerned with property damage arising out of a lease for business purposes:\nIt is a contract between persons conducting a strictly private business and relates entirely to their personal and private affairs, and so cannot be opposed to public policy. It would seem to be a matter of no interest to the public or the State.\nSee Arensberg, Limitation by Bailees and by Landlords of Liability for Negligent Acts, 51 Dick. L. Rev. 36 (1946).\nThe foregoing cases and their progeny actually form the basis for the so-called \u201cmajority rule\u201d cited in 49 Am. Jur. 2d Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 870, at 839 (1970) and Annot., 175 A.L.R. 8, 83-92 (1948). It is safe to say, however, that there is no true majority rule. There are only numerous conflicting decisions, decisions concerned with contracts of indemnity, cases relating to property damage under business leases, and a disposition of the courts to emasculate such exculpatory clauses by means of strict construction. Annot., 175 A.L.R. 8, 89-92 (1948); Exculpatory Clauses in Leases of Realty in Pennsylvania, 15 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 493, 496 (1954). From this, one can reasonably infer that even though such clauses are recognized by some courts, a great number have regarded them with disfavor. The Effect of Exculpatory Agreements Upon Landlords\u2019 Tort Liability in Illinois, 54 Nw. U.L. Rev. 61, 69 (1959); Exculpatory Clauses in Leases of Realty in Pennsylvania, supra at 501; F. Harper and F. James, 2 The Law of Torts \u00a7 21.6 (1956).\nIt is inaccurate to characterize the foregoing as a \u201cmajority rule\u201d. Furthermore, one must ignore present day realities to say that such an exculpatory clause, which relieves a lessor of liability for personal injuries caused by its own negligence, is purely a \u201cpersonal and private affair\u201d and \u201cnot a matter of public interest\u201d.\nWe no longer live in an era of the occasional rental of rooms in a private home or over the corner grocery. In the relatively short span of 30 years the public\u2019s use of rental units in this state has expanded dramatically. In the past 10 years alone, in the state of Washington, there has been an increase of over 77,000 rental units. It takes no imagination to see that a business which once had a minor impact upon the living habits of the citizenry has developed into a major commercial enterprise directly touching the lives of hundreds of thousands of people who depend upon it for shelter.\nThus, we are not faced merely with the theoretical' duty of construing a provision in an isolated contract specifically bargained for by one landlord and one tenant as a purely \u201cprivate affair.\u201d Considered realistically, we are asked to construe an exculpatory clause, the generalized use of which may have an impact upon thousands of potential tenants.\nUnder these circumstances it cannot be said that such exculpatory clauses are \u201cpurely a private affair\u201d or that they are \u201cnot a matter of public interest.\u201d The real question is whether we should sanction a technique of immunizing lessors of residential units within a multi-family dwelling complex, from liability for personal injuries sustained by a tenant, which injuries result from the lessor\u2019s own negligence in maintaining the \u201ccommon areas\u201d; particularly when the technique employed destroys the concept of negligence and the standard of affirmative duty imposed upon the landlord for protection of the tenant.\nAn exculpatory clause of the type here involved contravenes long established common law rules of tort liability that exist in the landlord-tenant relationship. As so employed, it offends the public policy of the state and will not be enforced by the courts. It makes little sense for us to insist, on the one hand, that a workman have a safe place in which to work, but, on the other hand, to deny him a reasonably safe place in which to live.\nThe trial court is reversed and the cause is remanded for trial.\nHamilton, C.J., Finley, Rosellini, Hunter, Hale, Neill, and Wright, JJ., concur.\nCannon v. Bresch, 307 Pa. 31, 160 A. 595 (1932) also cited Fera v. Child, 115 Mass. 32 (1874). Fera, also a case of property damage arising out of a lease of property for business purposes, is apparently another ancestor of the Pennsylvania rule.\nWhether such a clause may be used in a lease of property for business purposes (as differentiated from residential purposes) to exculpate a landlord from the result of his own negligence in the event of property damage is not before the court at this time.\nBureau of the Census, 16th Census of the United States: 1940, Housing, Vol. 2, General Characteristics (1943).\nBureau of the Census, Census of Housing: 1950, Vol. 1, General Characteristics (1953).\nBureau of the Census, U.S. Census of Housing; 1960, Final Report H.C. (l)-49.\nBureau of the Census, 1970 Census of Housing, General Housing Characteristics, Advance Report (1971).\nIt must be noted that these figures refer to rental units and not to the number of occupants. The number of people who actually live in such units far exceeds the foregoing statistics.\nIn recent years the law has enforced duties toward the general public, which override strict contract principals. See Prosser, The As sault Upon the Citadel, 69 Yale L.J. 1099 (1960); Prosser, The Fall of the Citadel, 50 Minn. L. Rev. 791 (1966); see also Baker v. Seattle,. 79 Wn.2d 198, 484 P.2d 405 (1971), in which we held that the waiver of the right to sue for personal injuries, contained in a lease of chattels, requires something more than a standard recital of waiver in a rental contract.\nWhether a landlord and tenant may specifically enter into a bargain for an exculpatory clause in a residential rental lease, on the basis of reduced rental payment, is not before us."

    "Simpson, J.\nPlaintiffs instituted this action to have reformed and enforced a defective lease upon real property. A trial to the court resulted in the entry of a decree reforming and correcting the lease and enjoining the defendants from interfering with plaintiffs\u2019 possession and enjoyment until the time of the expiration of the lease. Defendants have appealed. The assignment of error is in ruling that plaintiffs have any rights in the property subsequent to November 4, 1940.\nThe facts may be stated as follows: Prior to and on November 4,1938, appellant Annetta Adaline Franz, the wife of appellant Carl Franz, owned in her own right the property in question. On the date just mentioned, Mrs. Franz and respondents entered into the following written agreement:\n\u201cThis Agreement made and entered into this 4th day of November by and between Mrs. Carl Franz, owner, and E. P. Garbrick and Paul V. Myers Witnesseth:\n\u201cThat the said lessor does by these presents lease, demise for his own use let unto the lessee the following described premises in King County State of Washington to wit\n\u201c100 ft. frontage by 300 ft. deep by 150 ft. lower width by 121 ft. by 100 ft. by 200 ft. one acre more or less\n\u201cFor and during the term of five years beginning this the fourth day of November 1938 and ending on the fifth day of Nov. 1943 at the annual rental of ($25) twenty five dollars a year of which sum ($25) one years rental has been paid at the execution of this lease. They shall has the privilege of buying if they so choose.\n\u201cFailure of the lessee to pay rental promptly when due shall work a forfeiture of this lease and no act of the lessee shall release him from his obligation without the written consent of the lessor.\nMrs. Carl Franz (lessor)\nE. P. Garbrick\nPaul V. Myers\n\u201cSubscribed & sworn to before me this 4th day of November, 1938. Stanley W. Brown\nNotary Public in and for the State of Washington, resid(Notary Public Seal) ing at Auburn.\n\u201cAny buildings constructed by lessee on above land may be removed at successful termination of this lease. Furthermore any taxes upon such buildings will be paid by lessee.\u201d\nThe real property had been used as a garden just prior to the signing of the lease. After the signing of the agreement, respondents paid the rent for the first two years of the leased period and taxes levied on account of buildings erected by themselves. After taking possession, respondents, with the knowledge of appellants Franz, proceeded to make certain improvements consisting of the building of a house, a sawmill, lumber shed, and a fence at a cost of $1,225. In addition, they placed machinery in the sawmill at a cost of four hundred dollars. The repair of the road and the installation of some water pipe entailed an outlay of one hundred dollars. They then installed a lumber yard and have since been engaged in conducting a retail lumber business on the property. The buildings were of frame construction and placed upon concrete blocks and sills. The evidence indicates that respondents exhausted their financial resources in making their improvements.\nRespondent Edward Garbrick testified as follows:\n\u201cQ. Isn\u2019t it a fact that all the improvements and the buildings that you mentioned in your complaint, which you have there now, which you have testified about, were put on the property for your own benefit? A. That is right. . . . Q. (Mr. Mulroy) Then, Mr. Garbrick, you knew under the terms of your lease you had the privilege of removing those buildings at any time? A. Yes, that is right, and I also had the privilege of buying it if we chose. Q. At any rate, you had the privilege of removing the buildings? A. Yes. Q. And they were at all times your property? A. Yes. Q. And the road was built for your convenience? A. Yes. Q. And there wasn\u2019t any road there before? A. There was a road there, just like you would go driving through a pasture. Q. At any rate, it was not satisfactory? You couldn\u2019t use it? A. No; so we graveled it. Q. And the pipeline was for your convenience? A. Yes.\u201d\nSeptember 9, 1940, Mrs. Franz conveyed the real estate to appellants May, who had full knowledge of the contents of the lease and that extensive improvements had been made by the tenants. Immediately thereafter, the purchasers demanded possession of the land leased to respondents and, upon their failure to deliver possession, a notice to terminate the tenancy was served upon plaintiffs. This suit was then instituted.\nThe lease was defective for two reasons. First, the property was not sufficiently described, and second, the instrument was not acknowledged by the lessor as provided by our statute of frauds, Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a710618 [P. C. \u00a7 3553], which reads:\n\u201cTenancies from year to year are hereby abolished, except when the same are created by express written contract. Leases may be in writing or print, or partly in writing and partly in print, and shall be legal and valid for any term or period not exceeding one year, without acknowledgment, witnesses, or seals.\u201d\nThe trial court concluded \u201cthat the doctrine of estoppel should apply in this case.\u201d\nAn unacknowledged lease has no more force than an oral lease. Omak Realty Inv. Co. v. Dewey, 129 Wash. 385, 225 Pac. 236. An unacknowledged lease of real estate for a period longer than one year only creates a tenancy of month to month or in some instances from period to period. Dorman v. Plowman, 41 Wash. 477, 83 Pac. 322; Omak Realty Inv. Co. v. Dewey, supra; Hansen v. Central Inv. Co., 10 Wn. (2d) 393, 116 P. (2d) 839.\nIt is well settled in this and many other states that a sufficient part performance by a lessee of the covenants contained in a lease removes the contract from the statute of frauds and authorizes a court of equity to decree the specific performance of the agreement by the lessor.\nThe exception to the statute of frauds, which compels a\u2019lease of real estate for more than one year to be in writing and requires it to be acknowledged by the lessor, rests upon the principle that a court of equity will not allow the statute to be used to perpetrate a fraud. The test as to whether the exception applies may be found in answer to the question: Have the acts of one of the parties changed his situation to such an extent that he cannot be adequately compensated in damages or placed in his original position? If the party should be put in that position, the contract, though otherwise void, may be enforced in equity.\nThe question for decision here is whether the acts of respondents in erecting the buildings and in making other improvements were sufficient to make the statute of frauds inapplicable. The decisions of this court are in harmony with the general rule that part performance by a lessee will remove the contract from the statute of frauds.\nThough McGlauflin v. Holman, 1 Wash. 239, 24 Pac. 439, Schulte v. Schering, 2 Wash. 127, 26 Pac. 78, nor Schulte v. Littlejohn, 2 Wash. 129, 26 Pac. 79, were decided upon the merits, this court did hold that part performance of a lease made the statute of frauds inapplicable.\nIn Snyder v. Harding, 38 Wash. 666, 80 Pac. 789,. it was held that a tenant on shares, holding over after the first year under an invalid lease after payment of the first year\u2019s rent, was entitled to a division of the crops.\nWatkins v. Balch, 41 Wash. 310, 83 Pac. 321, 3 L. R. A. (N. S.) 852. The lease of real property construed in this case was one for a term of five years. It provided that the lessees would care for a flock of goats and would clear land to the amount of one hundred dollars per year. The lessees performed their part of the agreement and on that account sought to take the lease from the statute of frauds. The case was presented upon the findings of fact in which the trial court found that permanent improvements were made on the premises to the value of three hundred dollars, but did not find that the improvements increased the rental value of the premises. In passing upon the question, it was stated:\n\u201cIt, of course, is inferable that such improvements would increase the rental value to some extent, but the amount is conjectural, and as the appellants are relying on an equitable principle, the burden was upon them to show that they would suffer some material injury if the ordinary rules of law were enforced against them.\u201d\nDorman v. Plowman, supra. Here the court held that an invalid lease for a term of years was a period to period lease after the first year.\nIn O\u2019Connor v. Oliver, 45 Wash. 549, 88 Pac. 1025, defendants interposed the defense to a quiet title action that they had by oral contract leased the premises for the farming season of 1905, promising to pay rental of one-third of the crop which was growing on the premises. This court held that the trial court was in error in allowing defendants to introduce proof to the allegations contained in the answer and, in passing upon the question, said:\n\u201cThere can be no doubt that the answer stated a defense entitling the defendants to possession of the land until the crop was gathered. The rule applicable to the facts in this case was stated in Watkins v. Balch, 41 Wash. 310, 83 Pac. 321, where we said:\n\u201c \u2018An oral lease, therefore, where possession of the property has been taken, is not void in toto, but it may not be a lease for the term agreed upon. If the rent reserved is to be paid periodically it is a lease good for one of such periods, but subject to be terminated at the end thereof, or at the end of any other of such periods. Thus, under the statute, where one enters into the possession of real property under an oral lease for a definite time with periodic rent reserved, he is not a tenant for the time agreed upon, but a tenant from period to period, corresponding to the times on which rent is payable.\u2019 \u201d\nIn Northcraft v. Blumauer, 53 Wash. 243, 101 Pac. 871, 132 Am. St. 1071, a parol lease of a logging right of way for a longer period than one year was not set aside at the instance of the landlord where the record showed that the lessee took possession with the lessor\u2019s consent, constructed a road at an expense of five thousand dollars, benefited the land by digging ditches, and purchased the lessor\u2019s timber as an incident to procuring the right of way. \u2022\nKoschnitzky v. Hammond Lbr. Co., 57 Wash. 320, 106 Pac. 900. In this case, the court construed an unacknowledged lease of a logging right of way for a period of ten years. The facts disclosed that the lessee built a railroad at a cost of forty thousand dollars, pulled stumps from the property, and cleared a stream, all in accordance with the terms of the lease. This court held that, because of the work done and the money expended, the case fell \u201csquarely within the rule that possession and part performance\u201d took the case out of the statute of frauds.\nForrester v. Reliable Transfer Co., 59 Wash. 86, 109 Pac. 312, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 1093. We held that a lessor who had expended large sums of money in fitting out the premises and in preparing it for the use of the lessee, which repairs were not beneficial to the estate, could recover damages under the provisions of an unacknowledged lease.\nIn Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co., 80 Wash. 401, 141 Pac. 900, L. R. A. 1915A, 288, we upheld a defective lease for the reason that the tenant had spent large sums of money in improvement and in complying with requirements imposed by the lessor. In that case, the owners of the property contended that estoppel could only be raised by one of two things: (a) by entry under the lease and payment of rent in advance for the entire term; (b) by such entry and a making of permanent improvements by the tenant, enhancing the rental value of the freehold. In rebutting the lessor\u2019s contention, the court said:\n\u201cThis court has never held that the payment for the entire term in advance and of the full rent reserved is a requisite to the upholding of an unacknowledged lease or even of an oral lease. On the contrary, it is fairly borne out by our own decisions that the taking of possession by the lessee and the payment of a part of the consideration or performance of work as a part of the consideration, if such payment or work is a part of the consideration inducing the lease and going to the entire term in addition to the rental to be paid at stated periods throughout the term, constitutes such part performance as to sustain the lease for the entire term. While never announcing the foregoing in so many words, a consideration of our own decisions will show that these elements have largely entered into them and not the single element of improvements made by the tenant increasing the rental value. McGlaufiin v. Holman, 1 Wash. 239, 24 Pac. 439; Schulte v. Schering, 2 Wash. 127, 26 Pac. 78; O\u2019Connor v. Oliver, 45 Wash. 549, 88 Pac. 1025; Northcraft v. Blumauer, 53 Wash. 243, 101 Pac. 871, 132 Am. St. 1071; O\u2019Connor v. Enos, 56 Wash. 448, 105 Pac. 1039.\u201d\nThe opinion continues as follows:\n\u201cThe appellant\u2019s argument seems so to construe the doctrine of estoppel as to limit its operation to cases where the estoppel arises from the benefits received by the lessor; that is, where the lessee has so improved the property as to add to its rental value. Though cases in which the estoppels were based upon these circumstances are cited, no case is cited which expressly so limits the doctrine or so limits it by fair implication. The general doctrine of estoppel is much broader than this. It applies not only to estop one who receives and retains a benefit from denying the validity of the transaction from which he receives it, but it also applies to estop one party to a transaction from denying the validity of the transaction which, if not sustained as valid, would put the other party, who has acted on the faith of the first party\u2019s attitude therein, in a materially worse position than he would otherwise have been. O\u2019Connor v. Oliver, supra, was clearly a case of that kind. The tenant, having prepared the land and put in the crop, whether it benefited the other party or not, would have been materially damaged by loss of his work had the lease not been held valid for the entire term, notwithstanding the fact that it was verbal. It is a fallacy to assume that, as against the lessor, estoppels can only arise in favor of the lessee by the making of improvements by the lessee on the faith of the lease, beneficial to the freehold, increasing the rental value and which the tenant cannot take away. This is only one side, or, more correctly speaking, one phase of the doctrine of estoppel. We know of no reason, and none has been suggested, why one denying a contract of lease is more immune from the' broad principle of equitable estoppel than one who denies any other contract. That the broad principle of equitable estoppel preventing a party to a transaction from asserting its invalidity in any case where the other party, acting on the faith of the first party\u2019s attitude touching the contract and its subject-matter, has placed himself in a position where it would be inequitable to hold the contract invalid to his injury.\u201d\nAgain, it was stated:\n\u201cThe language which we have quoted construes our own decisions not as limiting the doctrine of equitable estoppel as applied to the sustaining of contracts of lease, but as recognizing that doctrine as applicable to such contracts with like force and to the same extent as to other contracts. A careful consideration of pur own decisions convinces us that what is said in some of them relative to estoppels by improvements made by the tenant beneficial to the freehold was said because that was the only estoppel claimed in the given case, not because that was the only fact which could work an estoppel in any case. In each of the cases called to our attention and chiefly relied on by the appellant where written leases have been held invalid for lack of acknowledgment, there was apparently an absence of sufficient facts invoking the principle of equitable estoppel on any ground.\u201d\nGrubb v. House, 93 Wash. 200, 160 Pac. 421. The good will of a lessee\u2019s hotel business does not operate as a permanent improvement by the lessee so as to remove the bar of the statute of frauds as to an unacknowledged lease for five years.\nIn Armstrong v. Burkett, 104 Wash. 476, 177 Pac. 333, 180 Pac. 873, a tenant attempted to sustain an oral lease by proving that she made expenditures in building wall cabinets, shelves, and in changing the front of the store building, in building up the business upon which she was totally dependent, and upon the fact that she could not get another location and had ordered goods for the Christmas trade. In holding there was nothing to take the case out of the statute of frauds, the court stated:\n\u201cBut manifestly these things are not matters of estoppel. The things done were all for the benefit of the lessee and were in no sense a consideration going to the entire term. The purchase of goods and the building up of a business, as well as the purchase of seasonable goods, were all incident to the contract. Defendant is charged with the knowledge that her lease was oral and subject to forfeiture from month to month and that she might have provided against such consequence by insisting upon a sufficient contract.\n\u201cIf one who enters into possession of business property can keep possession indefinitely by fitting the premises to the uses and convenience of his particular business, by paying his rent, and by the purchase of goods to meet anticipated trade, possession once obtained would be better than any written lease, for the lessee could continue possession at his own will at the rent first stipulated, and unhampered by the usual covenants and conditions of a written lease.\n\u25a0 \u201cTo make an oral lease good for one year under the theory of estoppel there must be some element of benefit to the landlord aside from the rent reserved, or some injustice to the tenant that a court of equity will not tolerate, as, for instance, where the landlord has made the lease conditioned upon some alteration or improvement that would enhance the value of the property, or where the value of the property lies in the taking of an annual crop. In other words, the mere possession, the payment of rent and the conduct of a business in the usual way and for the sole benefit of the tenant, unaccompanied by circumstances which will create a consideration going to the term, will not make-an oral lease from month to month a term lease resting in estoppel.\u201d\nIn Lautenschlager v. Smith, 155 Wash. 328, 284 Pac. 87, this court held that taking possession of land under an oral lease in the spring, putting stock thereon, and summerfallowing it preparatory to sowing winter seed, and thereafter spring seed, is a sufficient part performance to take the oral lease out of the operation of the statute of frauds. In this case we cited Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co., supra, with approval.\nRowland v. Cook, 179 Wash. 624, 38 P. (2d) 224, 101 A. L. R. 180, upheld a lease otherwise void where it appeared that the lessor built a balcony at an expense of fifteen hundred dollars for the use and benefit of the lessee. This case followed and quoted from Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co., supra.\nIn Lamken v. Miller, 181 Wash. 544, 44 P. (2d) 190, it was held that an oral lease of stands at a race track for the exclusive sale of food stuffs and beverages for a period of two years was enforcible because of part performance, where it appeared that considerable expense had been incurred in building the stands and the operation during the first year, and by the purchase of additional equipment for the second year under the assurance that the conditions would be better. The total amount expended by the lessee in this case was $1,254.55.\nThe foregoing recital of our holdings indicates that somewhat different views were expressed by the writers of the opinions in the Matzger and Armstrong cases, supra. It will be noted, however, that this court ha"

    "Hamley, J.\nThis is an action by a . lessor against her lessees to recover damages by reason of the asserted abandonment of the lease by lessees and failure of the latter to clean up the premises upon such termination of the lease.\nThe lease covers the period from January 1, 1951, to March 31, 1958. The-, rental was one hundred dollars a month, due and payable on the first day of each\u2019'month, except that the rent for the final year, in the sum of twelve hundred dollars, was paid in advance. A sawmill and other structures on the premises were recognized in the lease as the personal property of lessees.\nAmong the additional provisions of the lease are the following:\n\u201c3. ... In the event of a forefeiture, cancellation or termination of this lease for any cause whatsoever prior to the expiration of the normal term thereof, or in the violation of. the terms or conditions of this lease, the Lessor may keep the said Twelve Hundred Dollars ($1200.00) or any remaining portion thereof, as damages, and may, in addition, pursue any and all other legal remedies allowed her by law.\u201d\n\u201c10. ... It is understood and agreed that within thirty (30) days after the termination of this lease, the Lessee shall remove any and all personal property or improvements from the said leased premises, and shall in addition thereto clean all rubbish, refuse and debris from said premises, and in the event of the failure of the Lessee to so remove said personal property or so clean said premises, the title to all personal property then remaining , in, on or about said leased premises shall immediately pass to the Lessor and the Lessee shall further and in addition pay unto the Lessor any damages sustained by her by reason of Lessee\u2019s failure to so remove all of said personal property and clean said premises in the manner herein provided.\u201d\n\u201c11. If the Lessee shall violate or fail to perform any of its covenants and conditions herein, including the payment of any rent when due, then the Lessor, may at her option terminate this lease by mailing notice of her intention so to do to the Lessee at his address hereinbelow set forth, or by posting notice on the premises hereby leased of her intention so to terminate and forfeit this lease. If and in the event the Lessee shall fail to cure said breach so complained of within ten (10) days from the date of giving such notice, then this lease shall be considered terminated.\u201d\nIn September, 1951, a fire destroyed most of the mill, and it was not rebuilt. Lessees removed the property not burned and cleaned up part of the debris. All removal and cleanup work ended in April or May, 1952. Lessees paid the rent to and including April, 1952. The May rent was not paid, and, on May 21, 1952, lessees were given a written \u201cNotice of Termination of Tenancy.\u201d\nThis notice referred, to paragraph 11 of the lease, quoted above, and called attention to the fact that the May rent had not been paid. The notice further advised lessees that if they'failed to pay the rent'within ten days from the receipt of the notice, \u201cthen this lease shall be considered terminated; otherwise, if - said breach be remedied, then to remain in full force and effect.\u201d\nWhen lessees did not respond to this notice, lessor called one of lessees to inquire what they were going to do about the lease. Lesse\u00e9s did not indicate their intentions in this regard. They did, however, offer to purchase the land. The offer was not accepted. Forty days after service of the notice of termination, lessees having neither resumed possession nor made any rent payment, lessor re-entered and took possession of the premises. Lessor then began this action to recover damages as follows: May, 1952, rent\u2014 $100; damages for breach of the covenant to clean up the premises \u2014 $1,250; and damages for the breach of the covenant to pay rent \u2014 $5,900.\nA jury trial was had, and, at the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case, defendants challenged the sufficiency of the evidence and moved for dismissal. The trial court orally denied the motion as to the claimed damages for failure to clean up the premises, and as to the one hundred dollars rent for May, 1952. However, the court granted defendants\u2019 separate motion to withdraw from the jury the question of damages by reason of loss of future rents.\nThe total amount prayed for in connection with the two items which the court left in the case was $1,350, against which it was conceded that the $1,200 rent paid in advance should be offset. The court therefore indicated that the case would be submitted to the jury with a maximum possible verdict of $150 for plaintiff. Defendants then consented to a judgment against themselves in that amount. The jury was thereupon dismissed, and judgment was entered for plaintiff in the sum of $150. Plaintiff appeals.\nAppellant contends that the trial court erred in refusing to permit an amendment of the complaint to increase the item of damages for failure to clean, up the premises from $1,250 to $5,000.\nThe notice of termination of tenancy was given in May, 1952. The complaint was filed on August 7, 1952. At 11:50 a. m., December 8, 1952, the day prior to the trial, there was served upon counsel for respondents a notice of intention to make a trial amendment raising the damage item as indicated. An oral motion to amend in accordance with the notice was made at the outset of the trial the next morning. Respondents objected on the grounds that the amendment was frivolous, that there was a lack of diligence on the part of appellant, and that respondents were not prepared to defend against the enlarged item of damages. Respondents further indicated that, in the event the amendment was permitted, they would ask for a continuance. The motion to amend the pleadings was denied, and when the motion was renewed during. the trial and at the close thereof, the court adhered to its initial ruling.\nAppellant argues that the trial amendment would have injected no new issue, and that, having prepared themselves to defend against a $1,250 claim of damages, respondents must be assumed to have been prepared to defend against a $5,000 claim based on the same asserted breach.\nThe assumption which appellant asks us to make is not a valid one. A requested fourfold increase in a claim of this kind gives a warning signal that those who assert it have determined to- make a fuller presentation, and perhaps on a different theory, than would reasonably be indicated by the more modest claim. Thus, one who feels that there has been adequate preparation against a $1,250 claim, or who does not plan to seriously contest such claim, might justifiably request additional time for preparation against the larger claim.\nSuch request was made here. If granted, it would have required the discharge of a jury already impaneled and the continuance of the trial. Appellant permitted four months to elapse between the filing of the complaint and the giving of the notice of amendment on the eve of the trial. No excuse was offered for this apparent lack of diligence.\nThe trial court\u2019s refusal to permit a trial amendment will not be overturned except for manifest abuse of discretion. Hendricks v. Hendricks, 35 Wn. (2d) 139, 211 P. (2d) 715. We are unable to say that the trial court here abused its discretion in refusing to permit the amendment.\nAppellant also contends that the trial court erred in holding, as a matter of law, that lessor had exercised her right to forfeit the lease, thereby precluding recovery of damages for abandonment.\nWhere there has been an unqualified surrender or forfeiture of the lease for all purposes, all liability not already accrued is at once at an end. Rockwell v. Eiler\u2019s Music House, 67 Wash. 478, 122 Pac. 12; Pollock v. Ives Theatres, 174 Wash. 65, 24 P. (2d) 396; Kelley v. Von Herberg, 184 Wash. 165, 50 P. (2d) 23.\nIt is only when the forfeiture or surrender is qualified, as in the case of a lease which expressly saves the lessor\u2019s right to also recover damages based on unaccrued rent (Metropolitan Nat. Bank v. Hutchinson Realty Co., 157 Wash. 522, 289 Pac. 56), or where the notice of forfeiture communicates to the lessee the lessor\u2019s intention to hold the lessee for such damages, notwithstanding the forfeiture (Brown v. Hayes, 92 Wash. 300, 159 Pac. 89; Pollock v. Ives Theatres, supra), that the lessee is not released from liability therefor.\nIn the case before us, the court correctly decided, as a matter of law, that there had been an unqualified forfeiture. Paragraph No. 11 of the lease, quoted above, clearly gives the\u2019 lessor the right to forfeit the lease for nonpayment of rent. The notice of termination indicates on its face that it was given in exercise of that right. Neither the lease nor the notice of termination of tenancy reserved lessor\u2019s right to recover d\u00e1mages from lessees in the event such a forfeiture was declared.\nAppellant calls attention to several circumstances which she believes presented a jury question as to whether this was an unqualified forfeiture, or whether it was an abandonment of the leasehold by lessees. In this connection, she calls attention to the rule that, when a lessee abandons the premises without just cause and refuses to pay rent, the lessor may either treat the term as still subsisting and sue for the installments of rent reserved as they accrue, or, treating the lease as terminated by the lessee\u2019s breach, re-enter and sue for damages for the breach. Brown v. Hayes, supra.\nAmong the circumstances relied upon by appellant are the facts that lessees left the premises and discontinued paying rent before the notice was given; that, after the notice was served, lessor asked one\u2019 of the lessees what they were going to do about the lease; that lessees then offered to purchase the tract; and that the notice gave lessees the opportunity to reinstate themselves under the lease by paying the rent' for\u2019 May, 1952, within ten days.\nWe do not believe that any of these circumstances have materiality with regard to whether there was an unqualified forfeiture by lessor. The notice speaks for itself, and plainly invokes the forfeiture provision of the lease. Lessees had the right to choose between the alternatives which that notice accorded them, namely, curing the breach by paying the May, 1952, rent, or suffering an outright forfeiture. They chose the second course. They are now entitled to rely upon the legal effect of that alternative \u2014 release from liability for d\u00e1mages based on nonpayment of rents which had not then accrued.\nThe judgment is- affirmed.\nGrady, C. J., Schwellenbach, Donworth, and Finley, JJ., concur."

    "Steinert, J.\nThe lessee of a building brought suit for specific performance of the lessors\u2019 covenant to repair and also for damages alleged to have been sustained by the lessee because of the lessors\u2019 breach of that covenant. Sometime after the commencement of the action, but prior to the time of the trial, the lessors repaired and also repainted the building, and at the hearing before the superior court the lessee conceded that his claim for specific performance had been fully satisfied. The trial therefore proceeded upon the issue of damages alleged to have been sustained by the lessee because of the lessors\u2019 earlier breach of the covenant, in that they had not made the repairs sooner than they did. At the conclusion of the trial, and after taking the cause under advisement, the trial court rendered a memorandum opinion and subsequently entered judgment dismissing the action, but without costs to either party. The plaintiff lessee appealed.\nRespondent lessors are the owners of certain premises situated at the junction of three highways near the city of Renton. On August 16, 1939, they leased the premises, including the building thereon and the equipment therein, to the appellant for use as a restaurant, tavern, and dance hall, for a term of three years beginning October 1, 1939, at a rental of ninety dollars a month. The lease provided that its term of existence could be extended for an additional three-year period at the option of the lessee, on the basis of a monthly rental to be agreed upon by the parties at the end of the original term, and in case of their inability to agree upon the amount of such rental it was to be determined by a committee of three arbitrators.\nThe lease contained a covenant reading as follows:\n\u201cIt is further hereby agreed that the lessors shall keep the exterior of the building, namely roof and walls, in proper condition with necessary painting and will also be responsible for any repairs needed in the sewer connections of the said building.\u201d\nThe front wall and one side wall of the building were of stucco composition and the rest of the building presumably was of the ordinary frame construction. The roof was flat, covered with an asphalt top, and was surrounded on three sides by fire walls.\nAt the end of the original three-year term, appellant elected to take an extension of three additional years as provided in the lease, but the parties were unable to agree upon the amount of the monthly rental for the extension period. Respondents were demanding that the rent be increased to one hundred fifty dollars a month; appellant was insisting that it be reduced to fifty dollars. Appellant was operating the place at that time simply as a tavern and dance hall, where beer, wine, and soft drinks were sold and where dances were held two nights a week, but no meals were then being served. It appears also that for some time past appellant had been complaining that the roof of the building leaked and that the exterior needed painting.\nThe parties being unable to come to any satisfactory agreement, three arbitrators were selected, in the manner provided in the lease, to determine the amount of the monthly rental to be charged during the period of the extension. After an inspection of the building, conferences with the respective parties, and a consultation among themselves, the arbitrators made a written report fixing the amount of such rental at one hundred dollars a month. In their report the arbitrators also expressed the view that the lessors had not fully complied with their obligations to the lessee and recommended \u201cthat the landlord fix up the building better than he has in the past; that is fix the roof; and keep the place in repairs.\u201d It appears, however, that shortly before the arbitrators made their report, respondents had put a new asphalt covering on the roof at an expense of one hundred dollars, although they had not done anything in the way of painting during the entire term of the lease.\nPursuant to the report of the arbitrators, the lease was extended and appellant periodically paid the increased rental of one hundred dollars a month. He continued to make complaint, however, regarding the condition of the roof and exterior walls of the building, and respondents endeavored from time to time to make the roof watertight, but did not immediately paint the exterior. Considerable ill-feeling thus seems to have been engendered between the parties, culminating in the institution of this action by the appellant in July, 1943, which was about nine months after the commencement of the extended period of the lease.\nIn his complaint, as amplified by a bill of particulars, appellant alleged that respondents had breached their covenant to repair by allowing the roof of the building to remain in a leaky condition, with the result that in the rainy season water frequently dripped in various spots upon the dance floor and upon the tables in the adjoining booths, to the great discomfort and annoyance of his patrons, and that respondents had further breached their covenant by failing to paint the exterior of the building, in consequence of which the place had a dilapidated appearance, causing many of his customers to discontinue their patronage. The complaint further alleged that the damages resulting from the respondents\u2019 failure to perform the above-mentioned covenant of the lease amounted to \u201capproximately $10.00 per day,\u201d and recovery in that amount was asked. The prayer of the complaint also asked for specific performance of the covenant of the lease. In their answer to the complaint respondents denied in toto appellant\u2019s allegations respecting breach of covenant and consequent damage.\nInasmuch as the action in its inception was a suit in equity for specific performance of the covenant to repair, the trial court was not required to, and did not, make findings of fact. The court did, however, render a memorandum opinion, in which it carefully reviewed and analyzed the evidence and gave a summary of the facts as, in the opinion of the court, they appeared to be established by the evidence. While there is some conflict in the testimony, the material facts are not greatly in dispute. Our view of the factual situation coincides with that expressed by the trial court and may be briefly stated as follows:\nAbout the time of the expiration of the original term of the lease in 1942, a dispute arose between the parties concerning the amount of monthly rent to be charged during the extended term. On account of the outbreak of the present world war and the construction of various government works and other projects in and near Renton, there had been a great influx of people in the immediate vicinity of the premises here involved. For that reason respondents were demanding that the rent for the extended term be increased from ninety dollars a month to one hundred fifty dollars. Appellant, on the other hand, was insisting that the premises were worth not more than fifty dollars a month. Among other reasons given by the appellant for demanding a reduction in rent were the alleged physical condition and appearance of the building. Appellant complained of the shabby appearance of the place due to the fact that the building had not been painted for five or six years. He also complained that the roof leaked in several places, allowing water to drop onto the dance floor and booths at various spots. Respondents endeavored to repair the roof and during the late summer or early fall of 1942 spent about a hundred dollars in that effort, but did not at that time do anything toward having the building painted.\nThe parties being unable to come to any satisfactory agreement, a committee of arbitrators was selected and the matter of rent was submitted to them for decision. After listening to the contentions of both parties and also investigating the premises, the committee on October 13, 1942, made its report fixing the rental for the extended term at one hundred dollars a month and recommending that respondents fix up the building better than they had done in the past, particularly with reference to the roof.\nThroughout the fall and winter of 1942, and the early part of 1943, appellant continued to make complaint that the roof leaked, at times causing water to drip in spots upon the dance floor and upon the tables in the booths. It was testified that on one occasion it was necessary to set out pans to catch the dripping water, and also to move the patrons who were seated at one of the tables to another part of the room. Frequently there were wet spots upon the ceiling and on one of the walls of the building. However, it does not appear that there was ever any actual interruption of appellant\u2019s business, nor was he ever compelled to close the place, even temporarily.\nIn response to appellant\u2019s complaints concerning the roof, respondents endeavored from time to time to remedy the situation. As stated above, just shortly before the arbitrators made their report in October, 1942, respondents had put a new asphalt coating on the roof at an expense of one hundred dollars. Apparently, however, this did not fully terminate the trouble, at least not to the appellant\u2019s entire satisfaction. At any rate he continued to make complaint throughout the latter part of 1942 and the early part of 1943. As these complaints were conveyed to respondent James Zerwoodis, he would visit the premises, most often with one or two assistants, and from the interior of the building would endeavor to locate the place where the roof was leaking. They would then go up onto the roof and make such repairs as seemed necessary in order to correct the situation. After completing the work they would return to the room below to ascertain whether they had succeeded in stopping the leak. This method of attempted repair was carried on many times, particularly during December, 1942, and January, 1943, and apparently with temporary success; but sooner or later another complaint would be made by the appellant. The difficulty seems to have been that of locating the exact place in the roof where the leak, or leaks, originated. The record is replete, however, with\u2019evidence of the respondents\u2019 continuous efforts to satisfy appellant\u2019s complaints with respect to the leaks. There is also considerable evidence in the record from which the trial court could have found, as it seems to have done, that appellant\u2019s complaints were greatly exaggerated.\nAt any rate, sometime in May, 1943, respondents engaged a contractor to inspect and renovate the entire roof and to paint the exterior of the building. The work could not be done, however, and was not done, until about the first of August of that year. In the meantime, appellant had commenced this action.\nIn his memorandum opinion, the trial judge expressed the view that the respondents had carried out the suggestions of the arbitrators with reference to repairs, and had also repainted the building, as soon as weather and labor conditions permitted. A careful reading of the record convinces us that, while some leakage may have persisted during the time when appellant was making complaint thereof, respondents in turn made every reasonable effort to remedy the situation and did in fact accomplish as good results as could have been expected under the circumstances existing during the latter part of 1942 and the early part of 1943. So far as the painting of the exterior is concerned, we are also satisfied that this was undertaken as soon as it could, and should, have been done.\nIn expressing these conclusions, however, we are not to be understood as holding that respondents were not bound by their covenant or would riot now be liable for any damages which may have actually resulted from their breach thereof, regardless of whether or not such breach came about through their willful neglect. On the contrary, we would be constrained to hold that, having covenanted to keep the roof and walls in proper condition, respondents would be liable for any ascertained damages shown to have been the proximate result of their failure to perform the covenant.\nThe trial court seems to have conceded, and we likewise assume from the very nature of the circumstances narrated above, that appellant was damaged to some extent by respondents\u2019 failure to keep the roof in proper condition against leakage. However, the important question in this case, both in the superior court and in this court, was and is not merely whether the appellant has sustained some damage by respondents\u2019 breach of their covenant, but, rather, whether the appellant has established the amount of his alleged damages by the required degree of proof.\nAppellant\u2019s complaint was drawn upon the theory that the measure of his damages was his loss of profits. At the trial, he endeavored at first to establish recovery strictly upon that theory alone, but later changed his position somewhat, to include as an additional measure of recovery the difference between the rental value of the property in the condition required by the covenant of the lease and the value thereof in the condition in which the property actually was at and prior to the time the action was brought. The trial court held that the evidence was insufficient to establish any definite amount of loss with any reasonable degree of accuracy, under either theory of the measure of damages. This appeal presents the question of whether the trial court was correct in its holding.\nWhile there is a diversity of judicial opinion on the question of the measure of damages recoverable by the lessee from the lessor for the latter\u2019s breach of covenant to repair, the decisions are in general accord upon the postulate that the damages recoverable for the breach of such covenant must be such as are the direct, natural, and proximate result of the breach, and such as may reasonably be supposed to have been within the contemplation of the parties at the time they made the contract; and, conversely, that remote, contingent, or speculative damages are not recoverable. 32 Am. Jur. 592, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 717; 36 C. J. 165, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 801.\nThe most usual rule or measure for assessing a tenant\u2019s damages for breach of his landlord\u2019s covenant to repair or other covenant with respect to the use of property, where there is no claim for, or proof of, special damages, is the difference between the rental value of the property if kept in the condition of repair or utility required by the covenant and the rental value in the condition in which the property actually is. Ingalls v. Beall, 68 Wash. 247, 122 Pac. 1063; Purcell v. Warburton, 70 Wash. 129, 126 Pac. 89; Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co., 102 Wash. 423, 173 Pac. 47; Schermerhorn v. Sayles, 123 Wash. 139, 212 Pac. 156; Yakima Lodge No. 53, K. P. v. Schneider, 173 Wash. 639, 24 P.

R. 1239.\nOn the other hand, where special damages, such as loss of profits, are specifically set forth and proved, the recovery by a tenant, for breach of his landlord\u2019s covenant to repair or other covenant with respect to the use of property, is not restricted to the difference in rental value, as expressed in the foregoing general rule, but may also include such loss of profits as has been directly and necessarily caused by the landlord\u2019s wrongful act or default. In such case, however, the loss must be shown with a reasonable degree of certainty and accuracy, and the proof establishing the loss must be clear and convincing, free from speculation or conjecture. These complementary statements express a rule to which this court is definitely committed. Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co., supra; Schermerhorn v. Sayles, supra; accord: Kohne v. White, 12 Wash. 199, 40 Pac. 794; Cordes v. Guy Inv. Co., 146 Wash. 143, 262 Pac. 131. Other cases illustrating the same principle are: DeHoney v. Gjarde, 134 Wash. 647, 236 Pac. 290; Schultz v. Wells Butchers' Supply Co., 151 Wash. 382, 275 Pac. 737; Blakiston v. Osgood Panel & Veneer Co., 173 Wash. 435, 23 P. (2d) 397; Quist v. Zerr, 12 Wn. (2d) 21, 120 P. (2d) 539; Automatic Canteen Co. of Washington v. Automatic Canteen Co. of America, 182 Wash. 133, 45 P. (2d) 41. See, also, 15 Am. Jur. 558, Damages, \u00a7 150.\nThe position taken by this court on this general subject is well illustrated by the case of Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co., supra, which was an action for damages against a landlord for interference with the access of light and ventilation to a storeroom occupied by a tenant. On the question of loss of profits as a measure of damages, the court said:\n\u201cIt may be granted that, in certain cases, a tenant may show a loss of profits in the conduct of an established business where the landlord has unreasonably interfered with the full enjoyment and use of the demised premises. But cases so holding rest in an exception to a general rule, which has twice been declared by this court. Kohne v. White, 12 Wash. 199, 40 Pac. 794; Purcell v. Warburton, 70 Wash. 129, 126 Pac. 89. Interference with light is a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Taylor, Landlord and Tenant, 309(a).\n\u201cThe measure of damages for an interruption of quiet enjoyment by the landlord is the difference between the value of the use of the property as furnished by the landlord and the rent reserved. In other words, it is the diminished value of the use of the property. Tiffany, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 79g; Underhill, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 432; Taylor, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7\u00a7 177 and 317; 16 R. C. L. 770.\n\u201cLoss of profits are usually regarded as too contingent, remote or speculative to be considered. 16 R. C. L. 1056. The general rule should not be departed from unless it is impossible to measure the losses by it, or the character of the business is such and the proof of the profits so clear that the court can say, as a matter of law, that loss of profits was within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made. If this be so, it will declare lost profits to be the measure of damages. . . .\n\u201cBut if it be held that the loss of usable value is not a proper measure of damages, the exception to the rule allowing a loss of profits should not be allowed in this case, for, in sound reason and under all authority, a loss of profits is not allowed unless they can be measured with a fair degree of accuracy. The testimony must be clear and free from taint of speculation or conjecture. The rule rests in a principle applied in all cases for damages arising out of a sale of property or the use of property.\n\u201cTo sustain a verdict for prospective profits, the jury must have some reasonable basis for estimating the worth of the business. From the nature of things, prospective profits cannot be proved to the dollar. Yet the law does demand that there shall be tangible evidence sufficiently clear and convincing to reasonably sustain a verdict. There must be some standard of comparison.\u201d\nAgain, in DeHoney v. Gjarde, supra, this court said:\n\u201cTrue, this court is committed to the rule that loss of profits may be recovered, but we have said that the loss must be shown with a reasonable degree of accuracy, and that the testimony establishing the loss must be clear and free from taint of speculation or conjecture. [Citing cases.]\u201d\nThe trial court applied these rules to the evidence in the instant case and came to the very emphatic conclusion that appellant had not shown any loss of profits with any reasonable degree of accuracy, but that, on the contrary, his testimony on that subject was at best speculative and conjectural. Our examination of the record leads us just as positively to the same conclusion.\nThere was no showing of the amou"

    "Dolliver, J.\nThis is the second of three cases involving the same parties and the same property. This case, Esmieu II, comes to us on a petition to review a decision of the Court of Appeals. Esmieu v. Hsieh, 20 Wn. App. 455, 580 P.2d 1105 (1978). See also Esmieu v. Schrag (Esmieu I), 88 Wn.2d 490, 563 P.2d 203 (1977).\nEsmieus, both as individuals and through a family trust, own over 15,700 acres of agricultural land. They desired to generate more family income by diversifying their holdings and executed two agreements with Jack Hsieh. The first, executed in December 1973, was to exchange about 9,000 acres (Tract A) for other real estate which Hsieh would provide. The second agreement (Agreement), at issue in this case, executed in March 1974, consisted of a lease and option to exchange. It provided for plaintiffs to lease another 6,700 acres (Tracts B and C) to Hsieh for about 20 years, with rent increases upon specific occurrences, and further provided Hsieh with an option to purchase these tracts by exchanging other real estate with specified values. Hsieh, by securing water permits and performing other necessary tasks, was to provide irrigation for the leased land. Esmieus were required to cooperate fully in this endeavor. Provision was also made for a 60-day notice of claimed default, and for termination of the lease if default should remain uncured.\nTracts A, B and C were already subject to leases to Charles Maiden. The Agreement required Esmieus to negotiate promptly for termination of the leases and to bear all expenses in order that Hsieh could take possession of the land as soon as possible. Hsieh negotiated directly with Maiden for a partial termination of the Maiden leases and agreed to bear some of the costs himself in order to facilitate termination. He delivered the termination agreement to the Esmieus' attorney for their signatures. The signed termination agreement was never returned to him; in fact, Hsieh did not even know it had been signed until just before trial. The trial court found that the failure of the Esmieus to deliver the signed Maiden lease termination to Hsieh constituted a breach of the Agreement; the Court of Appeals found that Hsieh could not enter the property to fulfill the requirements for obtaining water permits because of the Esmieus' failure to complete the termination of Maiden's lease. The Esmieus claim that the signed release was placed in escrow and that Hsieh voluntarily and independently abandoned his efforts to obtain water permits. The permit applications were eventually canceled in April 1975.\nHsieh paid the rent installment of October 1, 1974. Due to uneasiness arising from Esmieus' procrastination, the January 1, 1975, rent payment was made to Esmieus' attorney, conditioned upon their faithful performance of their Agreement obligations. Esmieus gave notice of default for nonpayment of rent and failure to provide irrigation to the property. After 60 days, they took the position that the Agreement was terminated because the alleged defaults remained uncured. In June 1975, they leased Tract A to International Pelleting Company (IPC) for 40 years, despite a provision in the Agreement which prohibited an assignment of any interest in Tracts A, B and C without Hsieh's consent.\nThereafter, the Esmieus brought this action to quiet title; Hsieh counterclaimed for specific performance of the Agreement and damages. The trial court denied Esmieus' claims and ordered specific performance. The trial court found that Hsieh's obligation to pay rent after January 1, 1975, had been suspended because of the Esmieus' lack of cooperation as required by the Agreement and by \"their inter-family agreement to actively block or thwart Dr. Hsieh's performance\". The court ordered the return to Hsieh of $22,500 which had been paid into the court registry as rental payments during the litigation period.\nTwo major issues are before us. The first pertains to the Esmieus' claim that their covenant to cooperate in obtaining water permits is independent of Hsieh's covenant to pay rent and secure the permits. They assert that, even if their failure to terminate the Maiden lease is found to be a breach of the Agreement, they were still entitled to cancel the lease and receive a judgment quieting their title.\nIn 1909, we held that courts must look to an agreement as a whole to determine whether covenants are mutual and dependent or independent. Toellner v. McGinnis, 55 Wash. 430, 104 P. 641 (1909). The trial court found, and the evidence supports the finding, that Hsieh had an overall development plan for all of the property involved in the agreements between the parties. The land was virtually worthless without irrigation. The intent of the parties was that Hsieh develop the property after irrigation was provided but irrigation could not be provided until water permits were granted. Hsieh's duty to obtain the permits was necessarily dependent upon Esmieus' promise to cooperate in securing those permits. Similarly, Hsieh's covenant to pay rent was dependent upon Esmieus' covenant to secure termination of Maiden's leasehold. The Esmieus' frustration of the basic purpose of the Agreement excused Hsieh's duty to make unconditional rental payments. Kneeland Inv. Co. v. Aldrich, 63 Wash. 609, 116 P. 264 (1911); Toellner v. McGinnis, supra.\nThe second issue concerns the 40-year lease of Tract A to IPC. The final paragraph of the Agreement reads:\nThis Lease and Option Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and is binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives and assigns of each of the parties signatory hereto; Provided, Esmieus shall not, jointly or severally assign any interest in the lands described upon Annexes \"A\", \"B\" or \"C\", without written consent of Hsiehs or Court Order.\nBoth the trial court and the Court of Appeals found the IPC lease to be a breach of the Agreement and ordered the Esmieus to negotiate a termination of that lease. The Esmieus contend the \"no assignment\" clause did not prohibit a lease and even if it did the clause is violative of public policy.\nPlaintiffs call our attention to a number of cases involving prohibitions against assignment or subleasing. Coulos v. Desimone, 34 Wn.2d 87, 208 P.2d 105 (1949); Willenbrock v. Latulippe, 125 Wash. 168, 215 P. 330 (1923); Burns v. Dufresne, 67 Wash. 158, 121 P. 46 (1912). These cases are concerned with the ability of a tenant to sublease the property or assign the lease. None of them deals with the right of a landlord to lease to a third party the very property which is the subject of an agreement between the landlord and tenant. However, each states that a no-assignment clause must be strictly construed. We agree, but hold that a strict construction not only of the no-assignment clause but of the entire Agreement shows beyond question that allowing the Esmieus to assign or lease Tract A was totally inconsistent with the intent of the parties and in the language of the trial court \"in direct violation of the terms and provisions of the Lease and Option to Exchange Real Estate\".\nFinally, Esmieus urge that, since IPC was not joined in this action, the trial court could not order the cancellation of the IPC lease. But, as the Court of Appeals correctly observed, the trial court in no way violated the rights of IPC. Rather, the trial court recognized those rights and ordered that IPC's lease be bought out by the Esmieus.\nThe trial court, sitting in equity, reviewed the complex factual matters involved in this case and fashioned broad remedies to do substantial justice to the parties and put an end to the litigation. The trial court neither exceeded its authority nor abused its discretion. The judgment of the trial court and the decision of the Court of Appeals are affirmed.\nUtter, C.J., and Rosellini, Stafford, Wright, Brachtenbach, Horowitz, Hicks, and Williams, JJ., concur."

    "Rosellini, J.\nThe appellant is lessee of certain premises in the city of Wenatchee; the respondents operate a business known as the \u201cPeter Rabbit Store\u201d on' the adjoining premises. Desiring to acquire the appellant\u2019s leased property for a parking lot facility, the respondents entered into a contract with him, dated October 5, 1956, whereby the appellant acknowledged receipt of $500 and agreed to convey, within forty-five- days, his leasehold interest to the respondents upon payment by them of the further sum of $8,200, which latter payment was to be made not later than January 10,1957.\nThe contract further provided that the appellant would, within thirty days, remove all of his personal property from a designated portion of the lot; and that upon completion of this removal, the respondents would pay a monthly rental of $163 until such time as they should enter into a new lease with the owner.\nThe paragraph on which the controversy centers, reads:\n\u201cFifth. It is mutually understood and agreed by the parties hereto that in the event that Second Party is unsuccessful in negotiating a new lease on the above described premises with the fee owner, Mrs. Grace L. Zufall Boston within forty-five (45) days from date of execution hereof, for a period of forty-nine (49) years, at a monthly rental of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250.00), with option to renew said lease for fifty (50) years at a rental to be then determined, that this agreement shall be of no force and effect and that First Party shall retain the Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) herein provided to be paid as liquidated damages.\u201d\nAt the end of the forty-five days, a new lease had not been negotiated, and the appellant extended the time in which the respondents\u2019 performance could be completed. Early in January, they notified him that they would not complete the purchase. The evidence shows that they had attempted, through their attorney, to negotiate a lease, but that the owners were not willing to give a lease which did not provide for adjustment of rent on the eighteenth and thirty-fifth anniversaries of the lease. A proposed lease was prepared and submitted to the respondents\u2019 attorney. This lease provided for adjustments in rent, on the basis of appraisals, upon the application of either party; and provided that such adjustments should hot exceed fifteen per cent of the then existing rental.\nThese terms were not acceptable to the respondents, and no further negotiations were conducted. They paid the rent due under the appellant\u2019s lease for the months of November, December, and January. Early in January, their attorney notified the appellant that no lease would be taken by the respondents. Thereafter, this suit was instituted. The action was tried to the court, which found that the respondents had \u201cwaived\u201d the forty-five day limitation, but were unable to obtain a lease containing the stipulated rental provision and, therefore, were not obligated to take an assignment of the lease.\nThe appellant contends that the respondents were required, under the contract, to diligently negotiate for a lease which would contain the terms set out in the fifth paragraph of their contract with the appellant. They further insist that the evidence shows, and the trial court should have found, that they failed in this duty because they made no attempt to induce the owners to change their minds after a proposed lease was submitted to them.\nThe respondents\u2019 duty to take an assignment of the appellant\u2019s lease and pay $8,700 therefor was, by the terms of the lease, conditioned on their successful negotiation of a new lease from the owners within forty-five days, said lease to provide for a rental of $250 per month for forty-nine years, with an option to renew for fifty years at a rental to be then determined. The appellant contends that the respondents impliedly promised that they would exert every effort to obtain such a lease.\nThe applicable rule is stated in 1 Restatement, Contracts, 366, \u00a7 257:\n\u201cFailure of a condition to exist or to occur even though the condition is some performance by a party to the contract, is not a breach of contractual duty by him unless he has made an enforceable promise that the condition exists or shall occur. Whether he has done so is a question of interpretation.\u201d\nIn accord with this rule, is 3 Corbin on Contracts 205-206, \u00a7 570:\n\u201cContractual promises are very generally conditional promises, the duty of rendering immediate performance being subject to some condition precedent, express, implied, or constructive. This condition precedent may be some other performance by the promisor himself; in some such cases the promisor has been held to have made, by implication, an additional promise to perform the condition precedent to the duty that he undertook in express words, while in other cases no such inference is justified.\u201d\nOur research has disclosed six cases having factual situations similar to the one involved in this case. In three of them, Slack v. Munson (La. App.), 61 So. (2d) 618, Lach v. Cahill, 138 Conn. 418, 85 A. (2d) 481, and Carlton v. Smith, 285 Ill. App. 380, 2 N. E. (2d) 116, an implied promise was found. In the other three, Britschgi v. McCall, 41 Cal. (2d) 138, 257 P. (2d) 977, Shaper v. Gilkison (Tex. Civ. App.), 217 S. W. (2d) 878, and Reinert v. Lawson (Tex. Civ. App.), 113 S. W. (2d) 293, the courts did not recognize that such an implied promise could exist.\nIn Slack v. Munson, supra, a contract for sale of realty was conditioned on the purchaser\u2019s being able to negotiate a ten thousand dollar loan on the property. The agreement was executed with knowledge on the part of the vender that the purchaser had been assured he could get a ten thousand dollar loan at four and one-half per cent interest for a period of fifteen to twenty years. The court held that this plan and understanding inferentially became a part of the agreement, and when the vendee was unable to negotiate such a loan, he was relieved of his obligation under the contract even though he could have obtained the money from other sources with more onerous conditions attached. The court said:\n\u201cIn order to fulfill his obligations in good faith under the provisions of this contract, the plaintiff was required to make a reasonable effort to obtain a loan similar to the one contemplated . . . and it is shown by the evidence that he did not cease his efforts to secure such a loan.\u201d\nIn Lach v. Cahill, supra, it was held that a provision in a contract for sale of realty making the purchaser\u2019s ability to secure a mortgage a condition precedent to his performance, implied a promise by the purchaser that he would make a reasonable effort to secure a suitable mortgage. The purchaser unsuccessfully applied for a mortgage loan at five different banks and loaning institutions. Although the seller subsequently offered to take back a purchase-money mortgage payable on demand, the court held that this type of mortgage was not contemplated by the parties and that the purchaser had made a reasonable effort to secure a suitable mortgage. The return of his earnest-money deposit was decreed.\nCarlton v. Smith, supra, was a suit by a seller of real estate, setting out in the complaint an agreement made subject to the procurement of a satisfactory lease. A demurrer to the complaint was sustained, and on appeal the court held that the seller was required to allege the procurement of a lease satisfactory to the buyer or his willful refusal to procure such a lease. The demurrer was held properly sustained to a count which lacked these allegations. In reversing as to another count, which alleged that the buyer made no effort to obtain a satisfactory lease, the court said:\n\u201cThe enforcement of the contract was by its terms dependent upon \u2018the procurement of a satisfactory lease between second party and owner of the building wherein business is now located.\u2019 This clearly contemplated that there should be some effort on the part of appellee to procure from the landlord a lease which was satisfactory to him. If he could, without good reason, refrain from doing so, then the agreement, at his whim, could be rendered nugatory and the execution of the contract an idle and meaningless ceremony. We cannot ascribe to the parties, as evidenced by the language of the contract, such an intent; on the contrary, it is our conclusion that they purposed that appellee should, in good faith, attempt to secure from the landlord a lease which was satisfactory to him, and failing in the endeavor, should be excused from the performance of his contract.\u201d\nIt will be seen that these courts have implied an undertaking on the part of the buyer to make a reasonable effort to see that the condition is fulfilled; none of them have required him to do a useless act or to accept terms which are more onerous than those contemplated by his contract with the seller. In Britschgi v. McCall, supra, Shaper v. Gilkison, supra, and Reinert v. Lawson, supra, all cases hardly distinguishable on the facts, the court refused to find an implied promise. In the latter case, a sale of a gin plant was made contingent on the closing of a pending deal between the buyer and a bank. The evidence showed that the \u201cpending deal\u201d was for. the sale of a farm from the bank to the buyer and that the buyer, although offered the farm by the bank, refused to purchase it. The court said:\n\u201cThe stipulation under consideration, by its express terms, made the closing of appellee\u2019s deal with the bank a prerequisite to the existence of any obligation on the part of appellee to perform his contract with appellant. It, therefore, contains the essential elements of a condition precedent. The pending deal between appellee and the bank had no direct connection with the contract between the parties hereto. It was an uncertain thing, which might or might not occur. Making the closing thereof a condition precedent to liability on said contract did not imply any promise on the part of appellee or impose any duty on him to close such deal if he could. 5 Page on Contracts, p. 4516, \u00a7 2576, and authorities cited; Supplement thereto, vol. 2, p. 1813, \u00a7 2576, and authorities cited; 1 Restatement Law of Contracts, p. 366 et seq., \u00a7 257.\u201d\nIn none of these cases did the court refer to any of the authorities recognizing the existence of an implied promise in cases of this type. The section referred to in Page by the Texas court, simply states the general rule that a conditional promise does not include a promise that the condition will occur. Section 257 of the Restatement is the one which we have quoted above and which recognizes that it may be found that there was an enforcible promise that the condition would occur.\nIt is not necessary for us to decide here which is the better rule; for, giving the appellant the benefit of the more liberal holdings and conceding that there was an implied promise on the part of the respondents to make a reasonable effort to secure a lease containing the terms set forth in the contract, there was evidence that they did do so, and the trial court so found.\nThe burden was upon the appellant to allege and prove that the condition was met, that is, that the lease was procured or that the respondents willfully refused to procure it. This necessitates some proof that the lease could have been obtained had the respondents made a further effort in that regard. The record is devoid of any such evidence.\nThere was no evidence contradicting the testimony of the owners\u2019 counsel that they were unwilling in any event to give a lease which did not contain an escalator clause for the adjustment of rent. This being the case, a further 'attempt to negotiate such a lease would have been a useless act, and such an act the law does not require.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nWeaver, C. J., Hill, Finley, and Foster, JJ., concur.\nMarch 14, 1960. Petition for rehearing denied."

    "Blake, J.\nDefendant was tenant under a lease terminating June 9, 1941, of premises owned by plaintiff. After the lease terminated, plaintiff brought this action to recover the last two months\u2019 rent and for damages for breach of the lessee\u2019s covenant to repair. Defendant counterclaimed for damages for wrongful eviction. The cause was tried to the court, which, upon findings made, entered judgment dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint and denying defendant\u2019s counterclaim. Plaintiff appeals.\nThe appeal presents three questions: (1) whether respondent was absolved of liability for rent for the last two months of the term; (2) whether it breached its covenant of repair; and (3) whether attorney\u2019s fees should be allowed to the successful party.\nFirst. The term demised was from June 1, 1935, to June 9, 1941. There was a building on the \u25a0property, in which respondent conducted its business of selling and repairing heavy farm equipment. Some months prior to the expiration of the lease, respondent acquired property upon which it commenced the construction of a building to which, upon completion, it intended to move. In February, 1941, respondent notified appellant that it expected to vacate the leased premises on March 10th. Its own building was not ready, however, at that time. When it became ready, some time around April 10th, respondent began to move. At the same time, appellant entered upon the premises for the purpose of making improvements designed for its own occupancy of the property.\nDuring the several days that respondent was moving (and subsequently), appellant continued to make repairs and improvements. Respondent, during moving operations, made no protest or complaint of appellant\u2019s actions, nor did appellant, so far as we can ascertain from the record, make any demand for the rent due April 10th and May 10th prior to bringing this action. On the other hand, after respondent had moved out, appellant accepted the keys to the premises, completed the repairs and improvements to the building, moved in, and was ready for business on May 25th.\nUnder these facts, we think it is clear that there was a surrender of the leasehold by respondent and an acceptance by appellant. 32 Am. Jur., Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7\u00a7 901, 906; Hart v. Pratt, 19 Wash. 560, 53 Pac. 711; Schuss v. Rice, 152 Wash. 638, 278 Pac. 428. Respondent was, therefore, relieved of the obligation to pay rent subsequently falling due. 32 Am. Jur., Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 914; Metropolitan Nat. Bank v. Hutchinson Realty Co., 157 Wash. 522, 289 Pac. 56.\nSecond. The surrender and acceptance, however, did not relieve respondent of its obligations under its covenant to repair. Marshall v. Rugg, 6 Wyo. 270, 44 Pac. 700, 45 Pac. 486, 33 L. R. A. 679. That covenant reads as follows:\n\u201cIt is understood and agreed that said premises has thereon a brick building which has heretofore been used in the hide and wool business, and in consideration of no monthly installments being required to be paid by the lessee until the 10th day of June, 1936, the lessee agrees that it will enter into the occupancy of said premises on the 1st day of June, 1935, and will thereafter, and during the year 1935 expend not less than $1000.00 one thousand in cleaning up said premises and placing the same in a sanitary condition; and in remodeling and repairing the front and rear of said building to suit their needs and installing such new plumbing in the building as their needs may require, and in building a new floor in said building over such area as it may deem necessary for its business, and in redecorating the interior of said building, and making such other repairs and alterations to the interior of said building as it may deem necessary to properly carry on its business therein, all at its own cost and expense. The lessee further agrees that it will, from time to time during the life of this lease, at its own cost and expense, make such repairs to both the exterior and interior of said building, including the roof thereof, but excepting repairs to the walls of said building as may be necessary to maintain said building in as good condition as the same now is, and in as good condition as the same may he placed in after the completion of said changes, alterations and repairs to he made thereto hy the lessee as herein contemplated.\u201d (Italics ours.)\nAt the time respondent entered into possession, the premises were not only in a state of dilapidation, but also in a filthy condition because of rotten hides left by the preceding tenant. The building was not in a tenantable condition. It was a structure 50 x 140 feet, with a basement under the rear third. The floor over the basement was of wood construction, in a bad condition, and not adapted to the use of respondent\u2019s business. The remaining two thirds of the floor consisted of unreinforced concrete laid on the ground. It was badly cracked and crumbled. And, besides this, the roof leaked.\nThe respondent, without doubt, spent more than one thousand dollars in repairing and cleaning up the premises. Reinforced concrete was laid over \u201cabout twenty per cent\u201d of the old concrete at the front of the building. The rest of the old concrete floor was left \u201cas is.\u201d The wood floor was covered with one-inch pine sheeting, and the underpinning was reinforced to sustain the weight of tractors and caterpillars ranging up to twenty-two tons. The roof was completely recovered with tar paper. During its occupancy, respondent made such repairs to the wood floor and the roof as became necessary.\nWhen respondent vacated, the roof was again in a leaky condition- \u2014 in such bad state that it could not have been repaired at a cost less than that of a new roof. The wood floor was badly \u201cchewed up\u201d from running tractors and caterpillars with wheels with cleats over it. And, for the same reason, the portion of the concrete floor relaid by respondent was badly cracked. To sum it up, respondent left the premises in an untenantable condition. Notwithstanding the trial court found against the appellant, we think the statements we have just made with respect to the condition of the roof and floor at the time respondent vacated the premises, are supported by a clear preponderance of the evidence. Indeed, respondent scarcely denies that such was the condition of the premises. Rather, it takes the position that the condition was due to ordinary wear and tear incident to the character of its business, for which it is not responsible under its covenant to repair. But this position is untenable under such a covenant to repair as we have before us. In this covenant, there is no exception as to ordinary wear and tear. The covenant is plain and absolute.\nWhere a lessee covenants to put and keep a building in repair, he is bound to keep it \u201cwind and water tight.\u201d 32 Am. Jur. \u00a7 780. In other words, it is the obligation of the lessee, under such a covenant as this, to keep the premises in the condition of repair not only that he found them, but also that he put them. Arnold-Evans Co. v. Hardung, 132 Wash. 426, 232 Pac. 290, 45 A. L. R. 9, see annotation pp. 19, 20; Green v. Eden, 2 N. Y. Sup. Ct. 582; Lehmaier v. Jones, 100 App. Div. 495, 91 N. Y. Supp. 687; Devine v. Radford, 59 Misc. Rep. 473, 110 N. Y. Supp. 982; Feuerberg v. Polsky, 180 N. Y. Supp. 103; Ginsburg v. Jacobson, 276 Mass. 108, 176 N. E. 918; Goode v. Duke, 131 Ore. 488, 283 Pac. 34.\nWhile the premises were probably in as good condition as respondent had found them, they were not in the condition that it put them. To keep them in the condition it put them was an express part of the covenant of repair. In failing to so keep the premises, respondent breached the covenant, and is, therefore, liable in damages for the reasonable cost of putting them in that condition. DeLano v. Tennent, 138 Wash. 39, 244 Pac. 273, 45 A. L. R. 766 \u2014 and this notwithstanding that such condition was not adapted to appellant\u2019s own occupancy. See Appleton v. Marx, 191 N. Y. 81, 83 N. E. 563, 14 Ann. Cas. 150, 16 L. R. A. (N. S.) 210.\nThe only evidence as to the cost of putting the roof in such condition is the amount paid by respondent when it re-covered the roof in the first instance: $241. With respect to the floor, it will be remembered that respondent relaid only twenty per cent of the concrete floor \u2014 leaving the rest \u201cas is.\u201d Under the evidence, we are satisfied that respondent breached the covenant of repair in failing to leave that portion of the concrete floor in the condition it was put at the beginning of the term. Likewise, it breached the covenant in failing to leave the wood floor in such condition. There is evidence to the effect that it would have cost twenty cents a square foot to put either the concrete or the wood floor in that condition. The area of the wood floor was approximately 2,333 square feet, and the area of the concrete floor which respondent was bound to repair was approximately 933 square feet. Under the evidence, therefore, appellant is entitled to recover $653.20 on account of repairs to the floor which, under the covenant, respondent was required to make.\nThird. The lease provides:\n\u201cIn the event of any action or suit arising out of or under the terms of this agreement, the successful party thereto shall be entitled to such attorneys\u2019 fees as shall be adjudged reasonable by the court.\u201d\nThe court is of the opinion that $350 is a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to be allowed appellant.\nThe judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded with directions to enter judgment for damages in favor of appellant in the amount of $894.20; and, in addition, for attorney\u2019s fees in the sum of $350.\nRobinson, C.

    "Hill, J.\nThe plaintiffs, Raymond E. Magerstaedt and Maxine Magerstaedt, his wife, owned and operated a restaurant in space which they leased on the street floor of a seven-story building. After they had occupied this space for almost 5 years, the ceiling (plaster and metal lath) over part of the area occupied by them fell, causing considerable property damage; and, in consequence thereof, Mrs. Mager-staedt sustained some personal injuries. The restaurant was closed for 3 weeks while the entire ceiling was replas-tered and the premises repainted.\nThe plaintiffs brought this action to recover damages against their lessor, the owner of the building, and also the contractor who was, at that time, preparing the premises adjacent to the plaintiffs for a new tenant, the Washington State Liquor Control Board. The same contractor had, during an earlier period, made substantial changes and alterations in the upper floors of the building including the second floor immediately above the premises occupied by the plaintiffs. They alleged negligence against the lessor and the contractor for the manner in which the work had been done and for failure to provide proper and necessary support for said plaster ceiling.\nAt the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, the trial court dismissed the action on the basis that the terms of their lease prevented any recovery against the lessor, unless its actions in altering and renovating other parts of the building had caused the damage, and that there was no evidence that any such action had caused the ceiling to fall, and that no actionable negligence had been established.\nThe plaintiffs appeal.\nThe plaintiffs had leased the premises for 5 years (from April 1, 1956) from University Building Company, a corporation, a former owner of the building. In 1958, the defendant, The Eric Company, a corporation, had become the owner of the building; and in February, 1961, the plaintiffs had executed a renewal lease for another 5-year period with that company; however, the first 5-year lease had not yet expired when the ceiling fell.\nThe trial court, speaking of these leases, said:\n\u201cThe lease which was signed, and which was again renewed shortly before this occurrence, has the following provisions that I deem applicable to this situation.\n\u201cIt states in the third paragraph: [] \u2018That the lessee,\u2019 that is the Plaintiff here, \u2018has examined the above described premises and accepts said premises with their appurtenances and fixtures in their present condition and finds the same to be in good repair,\u2019 which is quite a recital, at least at the time of the renewal here, \u2018and hereby covenants and agrees to keep all thereof in good repair, and further agrees to make all necessary repairs of whatsoever nature to the same, except, however, repairs to the structural bearing parts of the building, the roof, exterior walls and foundation.\u2019\n\u201cI will rule as a matter of law that the ceiling here was not a structural bearing part of this building.\n\u201cThe sixth provision![] is broader. It provides that \u2018the lessee,\u2019 that is the Plaintiff, \u2018will not hold the lessor liable for any damages to property or persons caused by or arising out of any defect in the construction, maintenance, or use of the premises, their fixtures, appurtenances, or of the building fixtures and appurtenances of which the premises constitute a part.\u2019\n\u201cThis warranty says that the lessee, the Plaintiff, will not hold the lessor liable for any damage to property or persons caused by any defect in construction or maintenance.\n\u201cI believe I would interpret that to be a good contract, if written instruments are to have any meaning at all.\n\u201cThe fact that people carelessly do not read the fine print can be no defense, but I would interpret that to mean any defect in the construction or maintenance, meaning the present construction and ordinary maintenance \u2014 any damage he commits, to property or persons, caused by defect in construction or maintenance \u2014 I believe that is the present construction and ordinary maintenance of the building, and I do not believe that would protect them from damages caused by an unusual circumstance; remodeling of the building.\u201d\nSupporting the position of the defendant-lessor, that these provisions of the contract bar any action against it, and construing language of somewhat similar import is our unanimous en banc opinion in Griffiths v. Henry Broderick, Inc. (1947), 27 Wn. (2d) 901, 182 P. (2d) 18, 175 A.L.R. 1.\nWe have here no issue of fraud \u2014 no contention that the plaintiffs did not understand the contract they were signing with the lessor. As the trial court said,\n\u201cI believe I would interpret that to be a good contract, if written instruments are to have any meaning at all.\u201d\nHowever, we will consider the case on the same bases that the trial court used in entering the judgment of dismissal.\nThe trial judge indicated, in the language which we have quoted, that, in his opinion, the lease provisions would not protect the lessor from the liability for damages caused by any unusual circumstance such as the remodeling of the interior of the building.\nHe discussed the issue of causation from two points of view: (a) was there any causation between the remodeling done by the lessor (through its contractor, the defendant E. F. Shuck Construction Company) on the upper floors or in the adjacent space to the north, and the falling of the ceiling; and (b) was there any causation between the negligence, if any, of the contractor in doing such work and the falling of the ceiling. Concerning (a), he pointed out that the burden is upon the plaintiff to show that the falling of the ceiling was not caused by any defect in construction or maintenance, but by the remodeling. He said:\n\u201c. . . then we have the next question of whether or not there has been a causal relation shown from which the jury could find from the evidence, rather than speculation, that the proximate cause of this piece of plaster falling was some act done in carrying on the remodeling.\n\u201cNow, if there had been any of this throwing around of two by fours, or placing heavy weights directly above this point, or wheeling wheelbarrows over it, done within some reasonable time, say thirty days, it might create a question, but here it was, according to the testimony, probably over a year before, except as to work done in a liquor store.\nThe work done on the premises to be occupied by the Washington State Liquor Control Board, immediately adjacent to the premises occupied by the plaintiffs, had involved prying on a wall between the two premises causing plaster to fall from the restaurant wall (which plaster was replaced by the construction company), and had caused the wall to give.\nThe trial judge properly concluded that there was a hiatus of proof as to any connection between the prying on the wall and the falling of a section of the ceiling more than half way across the premises from the wall which had been pried. Had there been a connection between any of the claimed acts of negligence and the falling of the ceiling on the plaintiffs\u2019 premises, the proof was as readily available to the plaintiffs as to the defendants. As the trial judge said,\n\u201cI cannot find that there is evidence from which the jury can make those findings by the preponderance of the evidence.\n\u201cI find that there is an equal probability that . . . this plastering was old and defective . . . that would be a defect in construction.\u201d\nThe lease specifically insulated the lessor from any damage to persons or property \u201carising out of any defect in the construction, maintenance, or use of the demised premises.\u201d\nWith reference to (b), i.e., causation between the claimed negligence of the defendant-contractor and the falling of the ceiling, the situation on the issue of causation is the same. The claimed acts of negligence, as listed, are:\n\u201c(1) Punching holes in the ceiling over appellants\u2019 restaurant . . .\n\u201c(2) Allowing water to overflow on the second floor directly over appellants\u2019 restaurant . . .\n\u201c (3) Throwing lumber down on the second floor directly over appellants\u2019 restaurant . . .\n\u201c (4) Constructing a ramp across which wheelbarrows of building material were transported directly over appellants\u2019 restaurant . . .\n\u201c(5) Failing to make adequate inspection of the ceiling over appellants\u2019 restaurant after the collapse of the portion of the ceiling in an area adjacent to appellants\u2019 restaurant\n\u201c(6) Prying on the common wall between appellants\u2019 restaurant and an area adjacent thereto, which prying knocked plaster from the walls of the restaurant and caused a restaurant wall to \u2018give\u2019 . . . \u201d\nSeveral of these seem to us to be no more than normal operating procedure in an extensive remodeling of a seven-story building; but, assuming that all, except \u201c(5)\u201d which is a claimed failure to inspect, did constitute negligence, \u201c(2), (3)\u201d and \u201c(4)\u201d had all occurred more than a year before the ceiling fell and were too remote to require any serious consideration. .\n\u201c(1)\u201d involved the punching of holes in the ceiling over a balcony. These holes were in a portion of the ceiling over the balcony at the western end of the plaintiffs\u2019 premises, which did not collapse and which was some distance removed from the section near the front entrance at the eastern end of the premises which did collapse. Repairs were immediately made after the punching of each hole. There is no testimony that these mishaps had anything to do with the fall of the section of the ceiling with which we are here concerned.\n\u201c(6),\u201d the prying of the common wall in connection with the remodeling next door for the liquor store, which knocked plaster off the wall in the plaintiffs\u2019 premises, is the closest in point of time to the falling of the ceiling which caused the damage to the plaintiffs. There is no evidence that the so-called \u201cprying\u201d affected the ceiling, and no explanation of how it could have caused the metal lath, over which the plaster was placed, to break loose from the joists.\n\u201c(5)\u201d is predicated on a failure to inspect the ceiling after the fail of a four-by-eight section of the ceiling in the premises being remodeled for a liquor store, which occurred more than a month earlier. The ceilings were of different construction; the ceiling over the plaintiffs\u2019 premises being plaster over metal lath, while the plaster which fell on the liquor store premises had been placed on \u201cbutton board, or plasterboard,\u201d and the plaster which fell was from one four-by-eight section of the \u201cbutton board, or plasterboard.\u201d\n. The- superintendent for the contractor, called as an adverse witness, testified that after this plaster fell he did inspect the ceiling over the premises occupied by the plaintiffs and saw nothing wrong with it. There is no suggestion of what further inspection should have been made, or what it would-have disclosed.\nThe plaintiffs, in their brief as appellants, say:\n\u201cIt would be virtually impossible to .state with certainty which act of negligence led to the collapse of the ceiling. It may well be that all acts contributed in some manner. But at least the plaintiffs were entitled to have a jury consider whether or not some or all of the acts of negligence proximately caused damage and injury to appellants.\nWe disagree with the conclusion that, with absolutely no evidence of causation, a jury is entitled to guess whether some or all of the claimed acts of negligence proximately caused the ceiling to fall. This rises no higher than multiplied speculation and conjecture in an area where reasonable certainty was possible. The plaintiffs fail to show how the metal lath was affixed to the joists. To have proved a case for the jury, a plastering contractor, a building contractor, or someone familiar with construction should have testified to the type of construction and, at least, suggested one or more things that could have caused the plaster and metal lath ceiling to fall. The plaintiff Raymond Magerstaedt, in his testimony, suggested that the ceiling \u201chad been up there since 1889, or something like that.\u201d\nIt would appear that the plaintiffs were depending on res ipsa loquitur to carry the case to the jury and to put the burden of going forward with exculpatory evidence on the defendants.\nFor various reasons, res ipsa loquitur has no application in this case.\nIn the first place, the plaintiffs proved six acts of claimed negligence which, they say, may separately or collectively have caused the section of plaster ceiling to fall. What further negligence is to be inferred? Actually, the situation is that the plaintiffs offer proof of claimed negligence, but rely on res ipsa loquitur to prove causation and thus carry the case to the jury. This would require some other Latin phrase meaning: Having proved negligent acts, it will be inferred that the claimed negligent acts caused the event which occasioned the damages. The contention here is not that there may be some other act of negligence to be inferred, beyond the six we have discussed, but that the jury should consider \u201cwhether or not some or all of the acts of negligence proximately caused damage and injury to appellants.\u201d Having proved the negligence, it must still be proved, absent such a suggested phrase, that some act of negligence was a proximate cause of the happening which has resulted in the damages to persons and property which the plaintiffs seek to recover.\nIn the second place, res ipsa loquitur has no application where a tenant sues his landlord for personal injuries or property damage caused by the falling of plaster from a ceiling of the leased premises. As the cases indicate, it is difficult to conceive of a situation where the landlord has such control of the floor or the ceiling of leased premises as makes it possible to say that he has such exclusive control, management, or special knowledge of the condition thereof as would support the applicability of res ipsa loquitur.\nPlaster falling on a customer in a hotel room, a store, or a theatre where the owner or operator has the exclusive control of the ceiling and the means of knowledge superior to those of the plaintiffs in such cases, has caused many courts to say res ipsa loquitur applies. McCleod v. Nel-Co Corp. (1953), 350 Ill. App. 216, 112 N. E. (2d) 501, reviews many of the decisions.\nHowever, we find no plaster-falling-from-the-ceiling case where res ipsa loquitur has been applied when the relationship was that of landlord and tenant, and McCleod v. Nel-Co Corp., supra, recognizes the distinction. Res ipsa loquitur was discussed in Wadleigh v. Bumford (1918), 229 Mass. 122, 118 N. E. 265, where the plaintiff, a tenant, was injured when the ceiling of her kitchen fell. Two weeks previously the ceiling had been replastered by an agent of the defendant, the lessor. The court there said:\n\u201c. . . Other than such inference as may be drawn from the fall of the plaster, no evidence was offered to prove either faulty composition of the material used or unskilled and unworkmanlike application of the coating to the ceiling. Nor was there any evidence to exclude the inference of the operation of other causes which might have produced the accident. We are of [the] opinion that the mere occurrence of the accident raised no presumption against the defendant.\u201d (p. 123)\nAnother statement, on the reason for refusing to apply res ipsa loquitur in landlord-tenant cases involving falling plaster, is found in Slater v. Barnes (1925), 241 N. Y. 284, 149 N.E. 859, where a tenant sued the landlord for damages caused by the fall of plaster from the ceiling in an apartment. The trial court tried the case on the theory that res ipsa loquitur would take the case to the jury. A judgment for the plaintiff was reversed, the court saying:\n\u201c. . . That rule [res ipsa loquitur] amongst other things is predicated upon the condition that the agency which has produced an injury is within the exclusive possession, control and oversight of the person charged with negligence whence, legitimately, flows the inference that if there is any explanation of the accident consistent with freedom from negligence, he ought to be able to give that explanation, and if he does not give it, a presumption arises against him. The reason for and common sense of this rule under such conditions is obvious. It frequently happens in the law that if a person fails to explain that of which apparently he has knowledge the presumption goes against him. (Griffen v. Manice, 166 N. Y. 188.)\n\u201cBut that condition did not exist at all in this case. This piece of plaster, on plaintiff\u2019s theory, had remained in place for four years without so far as appears any sign of weakness or unsafe condition as the result of negligent repair in 1913. We can imagine that a variety of causes might have made it fall after a lapse of four years. But however many or potential these causes may have been there is nothing to indicate that the defendant had any opportunity to observe them. He was not in possession of the premises or at a post of observation and, therefore, when the trial judge erroneously imposed upon him this duty of explanation of something which happened beyond the realm of his observation or control, he in effect instructed the jury to find a verdict against him.\u201d (p. 287)\nOne of the most interesting cases involving falling ceiling plaster is Asheim v. Fahey (1943), 170 Ore. 330, 133 P. (2d) 246, 145 A.L.R. 861. The defendants were tenants of a building in Portland. They occupied the second floor of the building and sub-leased to others two storerooms on the street floor. In one of these storerooms plaster fell from the ceiling onto the plaintiff, who was an employee and also an officer of the corporate sub-tenant.\nAs in the present case, the trial court had dismissed at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case; and the Supreme Court concluded its opinion with these words:\n\u201cWe are of the opinion that the plaintiff failed to introduce sufficient evidence of negligence to take the case to the jury, and that, because of the fact that the defendants did not have exclusive possession or control of the demised premises, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur does not apply. The learned trial judge was correct in his ruling on defendants\u2019 motion for involuntary nonsuit. The judgment is affirmed.\u201d (p. 344)\nAs we pointed out in Chase v. Beard (1959), 55 Wn. (2d) 58, 65, 346 P. (2d) 315, res ipsa loquitur is a mere rule of evidence which permits a jury to infer negligence or want of care from the proof of injury and attendant circumstances. Professor Wigmore points out that its particular force and justice consists in the circumstance that the chief evidence of the true cause is practically accessible to the defendant but inaccessible to the injured person. 9 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940) \u00a7 2509.\nIn the present case, there was no element of exclusive control of the ceiling in the defendant; and the evidence of what caused the plaster to fall was equally accessible to both parties.\nWe find no cases, and the plaintiffs-appellants cite none, where res ipsa loquitur has been applied to take a tenant\u2019s case against a landlord to the jury where the action involved damages from falling plaster.\nThe appellants, in their briefs on appeal, suggest for the first time (so far as the record before us discloses) that they were entitled to maintain an action ex contractu on the theory of a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. This theory of recovery, not having been presented to the trial court, will not be considered. Malstrom v. Kalland (1963), 62 Wn. (2d) 732, 384 P. (2d) 613. However, unless the landlord is an- insurer that the ceiling will not fall, we fail to see what has been done that breached any covenant of quiet enjoyment.\nThe judgment of dismissal is affirmed.\nOtt, C.

    "Hamley, J.\nThis is an action by a lessor against the lessee to recover damages resulting from the asserted breach of covenants to repair and maintain the building, and to use the premises in accordance with applicable laws and ordinances.\nPuget Investment Company is the owner of a one-story and basement building of mill construction with brick walls, situated at 1415-1417, 1421-1425 Ninth avenue, Seattle. The building was constructed in 1923 or 1924, and has for many years been used for garage purposes. It is now known as the Paramount Garage. On March 28, 1946, the company leased the building to August H. Wenck, Ezra Royce and Barney Royce, copartners, doing business as Gray Line Tours. The lessees will be hereinafter referred to in the singular as lessee, defendant, or respondent.\nThe lease was for a term of one and one-half years, commencing July 1, 1946, and ending December 31, 1947. A monthly rental of three hundred fifty dollars was stipulated in the lease. The building, which was about twenty-three years old at the time the lease was entered into, was then in a bad state of repair. These conditions were known to the lessee before the lease was executed. Shortly after taking possession, the lessee expended in excess of three thousand dollars in making repairs and adding improvements to the building. During the term of the lease, the street level floor was used by the lessee as a private garage. The basement level was sublet, with the consent of the lessor, to one Jensen, who used it as a public garage and automobile repair shop.\nOn December 20, 1947, ten days before the expiration of the term, the lessor\u2019s attorneys wrote to the lessee, calling attention to paragraphs (5) and (6) of the lease, and stating that\n\u201c . . . you are required under these paragraphs to do a large amount of work on the premises before the expiration of your lease.\u201d\nParagraph (5) of the lease pertains to repairs and maintenance and the condition in which the premises were to be when returned to the lessor. Paragraph (6) requires the lessee to \u201ckeep and use said premises in accordance with applicable laws and ordinances.\u201d The letter of December 20th suggested that a conference be held to discuss the matter. It is stated in the letter that there had been previous discussions of the matter, but this is denied by the lessee.\nThe lessee vacated the premises at the end of the term without having made any of the repairs demanded in the letter of December 20, 1947. Shortly thereafter the lessor instituted this action. The complaint states two causes of action, only the first of which is involved in this appeal. Paragraph YII of the complaint lists eighteen items of work which, it is alleged, defendant should have done under paragraphs (5) and (6) of the lease. Damages in the sum of $15,309 (not itemized) were alleged to result from defendant\u2019s failure to do this work. An additional one hundred dollars was claimed by reason of defendant\u2019s alleged action in removing and storing a certain neon sign.\nThe matter came on for trial before the court without a jury. Extensive testimony and numerous exhibits were received. We make brief reference to the individual items, for the purpose of indicating the character of the claims and the principal mitigating factors relied upon by defendant.\nItems Nos. 1 to 3, as listed in the complaint, called for the installation of electrical equipment\u2014conduit, wire, boxes and fixtures\u2014which was wholly lacking when defendant took possession. Plaintiff contended that the second and third of these items were required to comply with the electric code of the city of Seattle. Item No. 4 called for the replacement of an electrical panel and the repair of electrical switches. The evidence was in conflict as to whether this equipment was in working condition when defendant surrendered the premises.\nItem No. 5 called for the installation of a new automatic sprinkler system in the basement, at a cost of $3,543.19, to replace one which was old, obsolete and not usable when defendant took possession. Plaintiff asserted that this installation was necessary to comply with the city building code. Item No. 6 related to glass breakage. Item No. 7 called for painting the interior of the premises, at a cost of $870. A good part of the interior had apparently been painted several years before. Defendant produced evidence to the effect that such interior painting in garage buildings of this class is unnecessary and serves no useful purpose as a protective measure or otherwise.\nItem No. 8 called for the repair of the ramp door to make it self-closing. Plaintiff contended that this work was necessary in order to comply with the city building code. The evidence does not reveal whether this door had been self-closing at any time during the lease. Item No. 9 called for the repair of wood floor and beams at the north door on the main floor. Item No. 10, involving an expenditure of $1,-593.77, called for the installation of a rolling fire door between the auto repair shop and the garage in the basement. It was claimed that this installation was necessary to comply with the building code. Item No. 11 was waived by plaintiff.\nItem No. 12 involved the replacement of both first floor front doors at a cost of $843.34. Defendant\u2019s witness testified that these doors could be repaired at small cost. Item No. 13 related to the replacement of the basement door at the alley. Defendant at no time used this door and it was nailed up throughout the term of the lease. Plaintiff\u2019s witness estimated the cost of a new door at $339.49. Defendant\u2019s witness estimated the cost of replacing the door at from $150 to $175.\nItem No. 14 called for the removal of existing partitions for the basement toilet, the installation of new partitions, and rebuilding and installing a sheet metal duct. It was not definitely established whether this facility was in the building at the time defendant took possession. There did not seem to be any evidence of disrepair, but it was.asserted that these changes were necessary to comply with the building code.\nUnder item No. 15, plaintiff claimed $57.12 as the cost of removing certain rubbish. Witnesses for defendant denied that this was defendant\u2019s rubbish and also minimized the work involved in obtaining its removal. Items Nos. 16 and 18 called for structural repairs consisting of the replacement of columns, beams and joists. The total amount claimed under these two items was $1,995.31. Item No. 17 called for the replacement of two thousand square feet of flooring in the north section of the building. The testimony was in conflict as to the state of repair of most of the flooring. Defendant\u2019s witnesses testified that the flooring, as repaired by defendant, was adequate for the normal purposes of the building.\nThe evidence showed that the conditions requiring these repairs, with the possible exception of some of the glass, existed at the time the lease was signed and were due to decay and wear and tear which had already taken place; that many of the repairs were of a more or less permanent nature; that some of them have structural characteristics; that some items pertain more to improvements than to replacements or repairs; and that most, if not all, of them were principally for the benefit of the lessor.\nThe evidence further showed that the building was in better condition at the end of the lease term than it was at the beginning. There had been some wear and tear during the term (excepted in the covenant to repair), and some glass breakage, for which the court allowed recovery. On the other hand, the condition of the building had been substantially bettered by the repairs and improvements which defendant made at the beginning of the lease.\nSeveral experienced garagemen testified that this building would be classified as a third-class garage. According to this testimony, a first-class garage is one with concrete walls and floors, electrically operated doors, and wider ramps and more convenient arrangements throughout. Except with respect to compliance with certain laws and ordinances, the testimony was uncontradicted that the building, as repaired by defendant at the commencement of the term, was in an adequate state of repair to meet all the reasonable needs and requirements of defendant.\nThe evidence also showed that, after defendant vacated the premises, plaintiff had all of the repairs made, as listed in the complaint and set out above, except items Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7,11, and 14. On the basis of the testimony as to the actual cost of the repairs made, and the estimated cost of repairs not made, plaintiff during the trial reduced its demand from $15,409 to $10,933.89. This included an allowance of $148.32 instead of the originally claimed one hundred dollars for removal of the neon sign. It included no allowance under item No. 11, as plaintiff waived that claim. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, defendant admitted liability in the amount of three hundred fifty dollars, and deposited that amount in the registry of the court.\nThe trial court took the case under advisement at the close of the trial on May 4, 1949. On August 26, 1949, a comprehensive memorandum decision was filed, in which the facts and applicable law were reviewed at length. The trial court allowed full recovery on items Nos. 6 and 9 and the $148.32 damages claimed for removal of the neon sign. The trial court also allowed fifty dollars of the $843.34 claimed under item No. 12; one hundred twenty-five dollars of the $339.49 claimed under item No. 13; and fifteen dollars of the $57.12 claimed under item No. 15. The remaining items were entirely disallowed. Findings of fact, conclusions of law and judgment for plaintiff in the sum of $738.53 were thereupon entered. Plaintiff has appealed, and defendant has cross-appealed.\nAppellant\u2019s assignments of error present two principal questions. The first of these is whether paragraph (5) of the lease required respondent to make the repairs as listed in the complaint to an extent greater than recognized in the judgment entered. This paragraph of the lease reads as follows:\n\u201c (5) Unless otherwise provided in this lease, lessee, having ascertained the physical condition of said premises from a careful and complete inspection thereof, accepts said premises in present condition, no exceptions. At the commencement of the term of this lease lessee shall place and thereafter shall keep and maintain said premises in a neat, clean and sanitary condition and in a first class state of repair, all at lessee\u2019s expense; provided, however, that lessee\u2019s obligation to repair shall not extend to the outside walls, roof and foundation of the building, if any there be, in which said premises are located unless repairs thereto be necessitated by lessee\u2019s negligence. Pursuant to said obligation lessee shall promptly replace any glass in or hereafter installed in said premises whether the same be in windows, the front, doors or other places, which becomes broken or damaged, provided, however, that if lessee at lessee\u2019s expense takes out and maintains insurance against breakage and damage of said glass in an amount and in a company satisfactory to lessor or agent and lessor is named as the assured in the policy, then lessee shall be relieved of the obligation of replacing broken or damaged glass. At the expiration of the term of this lease or its earlier termination, lessee shall redeliver possession of said premises to lessor and lessee covenants and agrees that at the time of said expiration or termination said premises will be in the best physical condition in which they were at any time during the lease term, ordinary wear and tear and damage by fire not caused by lessee\u2019s negligence and other casualty not so caused, excepted.\u201d\nIt will be observed that the above-quoted paragraph contains three provisions, the first relating to the condition of the premises when the lessee takes possession; the second relating to the lessee\u2019s duty to repair and maintain the premises; and the third relating to the condition the premises are to be in when returned at the end of the term. The issue before us brings into question only the second provision, relating to the lessee\u2019s duty to repair and maintain the premises. To the extent that the lessee had such a duty, then it was concededly obligated, under the third provision, to turn back the premises in the state of repair called for.\nUnder the second provision of paragraph (5), respondent covenanted that at the commencement of the term it would \u201cplace\u201d and thereafter \u201ckeep and maintain\u201d the premises in a .neat, clean and sanitary condition and in a \u201cfirst class state of repair\u201d; it being provided that such obligation to repair did not extend to outside walls, roof and foundation of the building, unless such repairs were\" necessitated by respondent\u2019s negligence.\nAppellant contends that all of the repairs listed in the complaint (except item No. 11 which was waived) were necessary in order to place the building in a \u201cfirst class\u201d state of repair. Respondent, on the other hand, contends that it made all repairs at the beginning of the term which were necessary to place the building in a \u201cfirst class state\u201d of repair. The primary issue on this branch of the case, therefore, is the construction to be given the term \u201cfirst class state of repair\u201d as used in this lease.\nIt is perfectly competent for the parties to a lease to place upon the lessee the obligation of making very substantial and even structural repairs at the commencement of, or during the course of, the lease term. Such a covenant may call for repairs not necessary to the lessee\u2019s use of the premises, and of primary benefit to the lessor. However, when this is the intention, the covenant is usually specific in itemizing the work to be done. Here there was no itemization of repairs to be made by the lessee at the commencement of the term, except with respect to glass breakage. The trial court allowed this item in full.\nThe making of repairs which will substantially improve the condition and value of the premises, when required under the covenants of a lease, constitutes a part of the benefit the lessor expects to derive from the lease, along with the payment of rentals. Accordingly, where a comprehensive covenant of this kind is intended, there is usually a provision giving the tenant free occupancy for a specified period, or some indication that stipulated monthly payments have been lessened because of the other benefits the lessor is to receive. For example, the lease involved in Yakima Valley Motors v. Webb Tractor & Equipment Co., 14 Wn. (2d) 468, 128 P. (2d) 507, recites that, in consideration of no monthly installments being required until a specified date, the tenant would spend not less than one thousand dollars in cleaning up the premises and making specified repairs and replacements. A year\u2019s rental of a six-year term was thus waived.\nIn the instant case the lease does not waive rentals for any part of the term, or in any other way indicate that the monthly rentals were reduced in consideration of the lessee making substantial repairs for the primary benefit of the lessor. The reserved rental of three hundred fifty dollars a month amounts to $6,300 for the eighteen-months term. Appellant now claims an additional $10,933.89 because of respondent\u2019s failure to -make such repairs. This would increase appellant\u2019s monetary benefits under the lease one hundred seventy-three per cent above the total rental for the term. In reviewing a similar contention in Second United Cities Realty Corp. v. Price & Schumacher Co., 242 N. Y. 120, 124, 151 N. E. 150, where the cost of the repairs would have about equalled the total reserved rent, the court said:\n\u201cThat such a liability was to be cast upon the tenant by. this lease could hardly have been within the contemplation of the parties.\u201d\nThe term \u201cfirst class state of repair\u201d has no precise and generally recognized meaning applicable under any and all circumstances. The meaning to be ascribed to such a term is to be drawn not only from a study of the leasing instrument, but also from a consideration of the surrounding circumstances; the type, age and condition of the building; the uses to which it is adapted; the use which the lessee is to make of the building; the character of repairs in question; and the lessee\u2019s need of such repairs. See Codman v. Hygrade Food Products Corp., 295 Mass. 195, 3 N. E. (2d) 759, 106 A. L. R. 1354, where the court was called upon to construe the somewhat similar terms \u201cin good tenantable repair\u201d and \u201cin good condition.\u201d See, also, 32 Am. Jur. 675, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 790; and the annotations in 45 A. L. R. 12 and 106 A. L. R. 1358.\nIn the instant case the building has long been used only as a public or private garage; it was in a somewhat dilapidated condition when respondent took possession; respondent expended on repairs and improvements a sum equal to almost half of the reserved rent for the entire term; the testimony is uncontradicted that, as so repaired, the building was entirely satisfactory for respondent\u2019s purposes. The trial court concluded that, under those circumstances, the repairs which were made (except as to items for which additional allowance was made) placed the building in a \u201cfirst class state of repair\u201d within the meaning of paragraph (5) of the lease.\nWe are in accord with the trial court\u2019s conclusions. Courts will not extend or enlarge the obligation of a lessee beyond the plain meaning of the language used and the intention existing at the time it was made. Armstrong v. Maybee, 17 Wash. 24, 48 Pac. 737, 61 Am. St. 898; Anderson v. Ferguson, 17 Wn. (2d) 262, 135 P. (2d) 302; 51 C. J. S. 1087, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 368. Ambiguities in a lease must be resolved in favor of the lessee. Anderson v. Ferguson, supra. Moreover, since the instrument was prepared by the lessor, it must be construed most strongly in favor of the lessee. King v. Richards-Cunningham Co., 46 Wyo. 355, 28 P. (2d) 492.\nApplying these familiar rules of construction, we are of the view that the term \u201cfirst class state of repair,\u201d as here used, meant only such repairs as were reasonably necessary for the conduct of a private or public garaging business during the lease term in the kind of building in question. The items of repair which were disallowed did not fall in this category\u2014some were improvements instead of repairs; some were suitable to a modern first-class garage but not to a third-class garage; some were structural repairs beneficial to the lessor but not required for the purposes of the lessee during the term of the lease. Where items were allowed in part, we have examined the record, and conclude that the preponderance of the evidence does not call for revision.\nIn reaching this conclusion we have not overlooked the five decisions of this court cited and relied upon by appellant. These are Armstrong v. Maybee, supra; Arnold-Evans Co. v. Hardung, 132 Wash. 426, 232 Pac. 290, 45 A. L. R. 9; Yakima Valley Motors v. Webb Tractor & Equipment Co., supra; Anderson v. Ferguson, supra; and Publishers Bldg. Co. v. Miller, 25 Wn. (2d) 927, 172 P. (2d) 489.\nThe Yakima Valley Motors case is the only one of these involving a covenant requiring the lessee not only to maintain the building in the condition received, but to substantially improve the condition of the premises for the primary benefit of the lessor. It was there found that the lessee had made the required improvements, but had thereafter permitted the building to become run down during the term of the lease, and had returned the building in that condition to the lessor. Since this was a breach of the covenant to return the building in its repaired condition, the lessee was held liable. There was no question as to what repairs were required of the lessee\u2014they were specified in the lease. Nor was there any question as to whether the lessee had ori"

    "Hamilton, J.\nPlaintiff fell through the floor of his orally rented premises and was injured. He sued defendants, his landlords, in tort, alleging negligent failure to comply with an oral agreement to repair and maintain the premises in a safe condition. Defendants denied any covenant of repair or maintenance and negligence, and affirmatively alleged contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff. The issue of liability was tried separately and submitted to a jury. The jury returned a verdict favorable to defendants. The trial court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for new trial and entered a judgment of dismissal. Plaintiff appeals.\nOn appeal, plaintiff essentially contends his theory of the case was not properly submitted to the jury. In support of this contention, plaintiff assigns error to the giving of a portion of one instruction and to the failure to give two proposed instructions.\nThe core of plaintiff\u2019s claim of tort liability is his allegation and contention that prior to or at commencement of the tenancy, and as a condition thereof, defendants orally agreed to repair and maintain the premises in a safe condition. Without such a covenant, plaintiff tacitly concedes that, under the circumstances presented, his claim fails. Plaintiff presented substantial evidence which, if believed by the jury, would support a finding of such a covenant. In addition, the evidence adduced would support findings to the effect that (a) the floor collapsed under plaintiff because of weakness due to termites or rot; (b) defendants, during the tenancy, had timely notice, through plaintiff, of a substantial weakness in the floor, and agreed to remedy the same; (c) repair of the floor would have revealed the cause of the weakness; and (d) defendants failed to repair the floor within a reasonable time after notice of its condition.\nIt is the general rule, as between landlord and tenant, that, absent agreement to the contrary or a fraudulent concealment of obscure defects, the maxim caveat emptor applies, and the tenant takes the demised premises as he finds them. There is no implied warranty or covenant on the landlord\u2019s part that the premises are safe or fit for the purpose intended. Hughes v. Chehalis School Dist., 61 Wn. (2d) 222, 377 P. (2d) 642 (1963); Flannery v. Nelson, 59 Wn. (2d) 120, 366 P. (2d) 329 (1961); Bidlake v. Youell, Inc., 51 Wn. (2d) 59, 315 P. (2d) 644 (1957); Conradi v. Arnold, 34 Wn. (2d) 730, 209 P. (2d) 491 (1949); Howard v. Washington Water Power Co., 75 Wash. 255, 134 Pac. 927 (1913).\nTo this general rule certain modifications have developed. See Prosser on Torts (3d ed.) \u00a7 63, p. 411, et seq.; 39 Wash. L. Rev. 352, etseq.\nThe particular modification, upon which plaintiff relies in the instant case, is to the effect that where there is a covenant or agreement entered into, contemporaneously with commencement of the tenancy, whereby the landlord is to keep and maintain the premises in repair and the landlord acquires knowledge or notice of a condition, existing either before or arising during the tenancy, rendering the premises unsafe, and the tenant, a member of his family, or a guest, suffer personal injury therefrom, after a reasonable time for making the premises safe has elapsed from the time of the landlord\u2019s notice, then the landlord is liable in tort for the injuries sustained, absent contributory negligence. Mesher v. Osborne, 75 Wash. 439, 134 Pac. 1092 (1913); Lowe v. O\u2019Brien, 77 Wash. 677, 138 Pac. 295 (1914); Fletcher v. Sunel, 19 Wn. (2d) 596, 143 P. (2d) 538 (1943); Restatement, Torts \u00a7 357; Prosser on Torts (3d ed.) \u00a7 63, pp. 421, 422, 423.\nRestatement, Torts \u00a7 357 Comment a explains and justifies the modification as follows:\n\u201cThe lessor\u2019s duty to repair in so far as its breach subjects him to liability for bodily harm caused to the lessee and those upon the land in his right, is not contractual but is a tort duty based on the fact that the contract gives the lessor ability to make the repairs and control over them. The lessor is not liable for bodily harm caused even to his lessee by his failure to make the premises absolutely safe. He is liable only if his failure to do so is due to a lack of reasonable care exercised to that end. . . . Since the duty arises out of the existence of the contract to repair, the contract defines the extent of the duty. Unless the contract stipulates that the lessor shall inspect the premises to ascertain the need of repairs, a contract to keep the interior in safe condition subjects' the lessor to liability if, but only if, reasonable care is not exercised after the lessee has given him notice of the need of repairs.\u201d\nThe trial court correctly recognized plaintiff\u2019s theory and the sufficiency of the evidence, if believed, to support a finding of negligence. In submitting the issue of liability to the jury, the trial court adopted and gave instruction No. 9 as proposed by defendants. Instruction No. 9 is a formula instruction, and purports to set out all of the elements (four in number) which plaintiff must establish to prevail. Plaintiff, in his exception to instruction No. 9 and on appeal, does not quarrel with the giving of a formula instruction. In fact, he proposed a similar instruction. Neither does plaintiff contend that instruction No. 9 fails to set forth, or otherwise refer to, essential elements. See Donner v. Donner, 46 Wn. (2d) 130, 278 P. (2d) 780 (1955); See v. Willett, 61 Wn. (2d) 681, 379 P. (2d) 915 (1963). Rather, plaintiff contends that the instruction, to his prejudice, incorrectly sets forth one of the elements.\nWe are constrained to agree with plaintiff.\nThe introductory paragraph of instruction No. 9 and the first element set forth read:\n\u201cYou are instructed that even where a landlord, as a part of the agreement of rental of premises, made before or when the tenancy is initiated, agrees to put and keep the rented premises in repair, and in the absence of concealment or fraud on the part of the landlord, it is still necessary, in order for the tenant to recover for injury or damage to his person or property resulting from some defective or dangerous condition in the premises, to establish by a fair preponderance of the evidence all of the following:\n\u201c(1) That prior to the tenant taking possession, the landlord expressly agreed to keep the premises in repair, it was clearly within the contemplation of the parties that the repairs which the landlord agreed to make were not merely repairs to be made for the convenience of use or appearance of the premises, but were repairs required for the safety of the tenant and that the landlord would be liable for injuries or damage due to unsafe conditions which he failed to repair; . . . \u201d\nThe statement of element No. 1 is, at best, ambiguous, and embraces abstract elements which need not be expressly incorporated into the requisite convenant of repair before tort liability may arise from a negligent breach thereof. It must be remembered that the covenant or agreement for repair and maintenance may be oral or in writing, and may vary in mode of expression and terminology, depending upon the situation and circumstances surrounding the particular negotiations. In whatever form, it need not contain a formal acceptance of liability for damages by the landlord, or a disclaimer of responsibility by the tenant. Neither are the parties required to spell out in their agreement that the purpose of the agreement is to insure the safety of the tenant rather than his convenience. It is sufficient if, from the language used, it can be found that the parties by agreement, at or prior to inception of the tenancy and as a condition thereof, understood and intended that the obligation for repair and maintenance of the premises in a reasonably safe condition for the intended use rested primarily upon and within the control of the landlord rather than the tenant. Restatement, Torts \u00a7 357 Comment a, supra.\nThe portion of the instruction referred to did not fairly apprise the jury of plaintiff\u2019s theory. Under the evidence in the case it was, in fact, tantamount to a directed verdict for defendants. Plaintiff is entitled to a new trial.\nPlaintiff further assigns error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to give his proposed instructions Nos. 4 and 5. We cannot commend either instruction as a model exposition of the rule of law sought to be covered, and we find no reversible error in the trial court\u2019s failure to give the proposed instructions as submitted. However, we do pause to point out that if, upon retrial, instructions Nos. 7 (No. 6 in the transcript) and 8, as given, and a formula instruction in the nature of instruction No. 9 are resubmitted to the jury, plaintiff would be entitled to an appropriate and correct instruction bearing upon the issue of the patency or latency of the condition of the subflooring or floor joists involved, insofar as such bears upon the defendants\u2019 duty under the alleged agreement to repair and maintain. See Johnson v. Dye, 131 Wash. 637, 230 Pac. 625 (1924) and Estep v. Security Sav. & Loan Soc., 192 Wash. 432, 73 P. (2d) 740 (1937). Otherwise, defendant\u2019s theory of nonliability and plaintiff\u2019s burden with respect thereto is overemphasized. The obligation of preparing and presenting a proper instruction, of course, rests upon plaintiff.\nThe judgment of dismissal is reversed and the cause is remanded for new trial. Costs will abide the result of the new trial.\nFinley, Weaver, and Ott, JJ., and Barnett, J. Pro Tern., concur."

    "Donworth, J.\nThis action involves a controversy between a lessor and a lessee concerning their respective rights and obligations relative to a certain beer and wine license issued to the lessee by the Washington state liquor control board (herein called the liquor board). Appellant Irene Miller (the lessee) will be referred to as though she were the sole appellant.\nRespondent (the lessor), having previously demanded a transfer of the beer and wine license, instituted this action thirteen days prior to the expiration of the term of the lease. In the prayer of her complaint, she asked (1) for a temporary injuction enjoining appellant (the lessee) from making any application to the liquor board for a transfer of the license from the leased premises to another location, (2) that, upon a trial of the cause, such injunction be made permanent, and (3) that appellant be required to make application to the liquor board for a transfer of the license to respondent or her assigns. She further prayed that, in the event of appellant\u2019s refusal to do so, the court appoint a commissioner to execute such application on her behalf.\nUpon the filing of the complaint, the trial court issued ex parte a temporary restraining order and order to show cause why the restraining order should not be continued in effect during the pendency of the action. The ex parte order enjoined appellant from taking any action toward effecting a transfer of the license.\nOn the return day, a hearing was held, which resulted in the entry of an order continuing the restraining order in effect pendente lite, from which no appeal was taken within fifteen days, as required by Rule on Appeal 14(3), 34A Wn. (2d) 20.\nAppellant\u2019s answer put in issue the material allegations of the complaint, and affirmatively alleged that respondent refused to renegotiate a five-year lease in accordance with the provisions of the existing lease, and that appellant had vacated the premises at the end of the term and had delivered the beer and wine license to the liquor board. Appellant also cross-complained for five thousand dollars damages because of respondent\u2019s refusal to renegotiate a five-year renewal and appellant\u2019s resultant loss of her tavern business.\nThe case came on for trial on the merits some two months after the term of the lease had expired. Appellant had vacated the leased premises at the end of the term. The principal issue was the correct interpretation of the lease provisions regarding the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to the beer and wine license. The judgment of the trial court (based on findings of fact and conclusions of law) directed appellant to execute an application to the liquor board for the transfer of the license to respondent or her assigns, and appointed a certain commissioner, named therein, to execute such application on her behalf if she failed to do so within fourteen days. Appellant was also permanently enjoined from transferring the existing license from the leased premises to another location, and her cross-complaint for damages was dismissed.\nAppellant has appealed from the judgment. Respondent paid her appearance fee in this court, but filed no brief, and no oral argument was presented on her behalf.\nBefore discussing appellant\u2019s assignments of error, we wish to briefly refer to the lease and other documents out of which the rights and obligations of the parties regarding the beer and wine license arise.\nThe original lease was executed in 1946 by respondent, as lessor, and one Irwin, as lessee. The term was five years and two months from August 1, 1946, to October 1, 1951. The leased premises consisted of the ground floor and basement of a certain building in the town of Ferndale, which, since 1933, had been used for the operation of a tavern, card room, pool hall, and small restaurant. The rental was one hundred seventy-five dollars per month,\n\u201c. . . It being agreed that no rent is due under this lease until a Washington State beer and wine license is issued to the lessee.\u201d\nThe following paragraphs of the lease are pertinent to this controversy:\n\u201c9. It is further agreed that none of the licenses for the business conducted in said premises shall be removed from said premises during the term of this lease. That further the lessee agrees that if he does not renegotiate a new lease with the lessor that he shall within 15 days of the expiration period of this lease apply for a transfer of the beer and wine licenses under which he is operating by virtue of this lease to this lessor herein. . . .\n\u201c17. It is hereby further agreed by and between the lessor and lessee that the lessee shall have an option to renegotiate a lease for a period of five years. The rental to be charged in said new lease to be agreed upon as of the date of the expiration of this lease.\u201d\nPrior to the expiration of the lease, the original parties, on July 20, 1949, executed a \u201clease extension agreement,\u201d which, after referring to the original lease, contained the following recital:\n\u201cAnd Whereas, said lease provides for an option to re-nogiate [sic] said lease for an additional period of five (5) years from the expiration date thereof, said date being October 1, 1951, and Whereas, the lessee is now intending to make substantial repairs to said premises, and desires to exercise his right to a renewal of said lease for an additional period of five years; ...\u201d\nThis document (which, as well as the original lease, was drawn by the lessor\u2019s attorney) contained an agreement that the term of the lease was thereby extended from October 1, 1951, to October 1, 1956,\n. . upon the same terms and conditions as therein [original lease] set forth, which terms and conditions are hereby incorporated herein as fully as if set forth herein.\u201d\nThus, all of the provisions of the old lease, including paragraphs 9 and 17, above quoted, were incorporated in the new lease. Irwin assigned his lessee\u2019s interest to one Taylor in April, 1950.\nOn August 11, 1950, appellant and her then husband acquired the lessee\u2019s interest by assignment from Taylor. Subsequently, appellant was awarded this interest by a divorce decree. Her present husband has no legal interest in the lease. Hence, appellant is referred to herein as though she were the sole lessee and appellant.\nDuring the summer of 1956, there was correspondence between counsel for the respective parties concerning negotiations for a new lease commencing October 1,1956. Appellant desired a five-year term, but respondent did not want to again lease for that period and would consider only a two-year term. At a meeting of the parties with their counsel, held in the latter part of August, respondent would not discuss a five-year lease but was interested in only a two-year lease at an increase of one hundred dollars per month rental, with a ninety-day cancellation clause in the event of a sale. No agreement was reached, but, when the meeting broke up, appellant and her husband understood, from what respondent said, that she would hear from respondent further about the matter. The next thing that appellant heard from respondent was the service of a summons, complaint, and temporary restraining order.\nAs we interpret the provisions of the original lease (particularly paragraphs 9 and 17) and the lease extension agreement, the parties intended that the lessee should have an option, at the end of the term, to have a five-year renewal of the lease on precisely the same terms and conditions as stated therein, except that the amount of rental was to be subject to renegotiation. The only reason that appellant failed to renegotiate a new five-year lease was because respondent refused to discuss the subject but insisted in talking about a two-year lease which would be subject to cancellation on ninety-days\u2019 notice in the event of a sale.\nRespondent, having breached the lease by refusing to comply with her obligations under paragraph 17, is in no position to invoke the aid of a court of equity to compel appellant to apply for a transfer of the beer and wine license to respondent in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9.\nThe importance to appellant of having a license from the liquor board should not be underestimated. There is only one other such license in the town of Ferndale. The evidence shows that appellant, prior to the expiration of the lease, was netting about four hundred dollars a month. Respondent testified (over objection that it was hearsay) that it is impossible to obtain another license from the liquor board for a tavern in Ferndale. Appellant surrendered her license to the liquor board when she vacated the premises. Respondent applied to the liquor board for a new license, but her application was denied because the existing license issued to appellant was outstanding.\nIf appellant were compelled to transfer her license to respondent (assuming that the board would approve the transfer), appellant could not operate a tavern in Ferndale unless the liquor board changed its policy, and, if appellant should be thus prevented from engaging in the tavern business in Ferndale, she would be deprived of a source of substantial income.\nRespondent, in this case, sought, and was granted, specific performance by appellant of one provision of the lease contract while, at the same time, she was refusing to perform another covenant of the contract which she had obligated herself to perform.\nThe equitable maxims that he who seeks equity-must do equity, and he who comes into equity must come with clean hands, apply to this case.\nHere, respondent refused to negotiate regarding the rental for a five-year renewal of the lease as she had agreed to do. Having thus prevented appellant from exercising her right to negotiate and, presumably, to obtain a five-year extension of the lease of the tavern premises at a reasonable rent, she now asks a court of equity to aid her in compelling appellant to transfer to her the wine and beer license which respond:-ent\u2019s own breach of the contract had rendered useless to appellant.\nAs was aptly said by this court, in Cascade Tbr. Co. v. Northern Pac. R. Co., 28 Wn. (2d) 684, 184 P. (2d) 90 (1947):\n\u201cAppellant is seeking specific performance of a contract which is a proceeding in equity. However, appellant has refused to accept a de\u00e9d containing the terms of the contract, namely, the provisions of paragraph 10. Appellant admits that it has not complied with the provisions of paragraph 10, yet it is seeking specific performance in order that it can avoid its obligation to perform those provisions.\n\u201cThe principle of law is stated in 49 Am. Jur. 10, \u00a7 6:\n\u201c \u2018The remedy of specific performance is an equitable remedy governed by equitable principles; equity will not decree specific performance of an inequitable contract or an unconscionable bargain, but will leave the party to his remedy at law. It will not grant such relief when it would be contrary to equity and justice to do so. One coming to a court of equity for specific performance must show that there is equity and good conscience in support of his claim to relief. He must come into court with clean hands, and, seeking an equitable remedy, he must himself do equity.\u2019 \u201d\nThe judgment must be reversed with directions to dismiss respondent\u2019s action.\nThere remains for consideration appellant\u2019s cross-complaint in which she sought five thousand dollars damages for loss of the beer and wine license. Since, under our disposition of the case, respondent\u2019s action for specific performance is dismissed, we think that the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the cross-complaint was correct, and we need not give further consideration to this assignment of error. Appellant will recover her costs in this court.\nIt is so ordered.\nHill, C. J., Rosellini, Foster, and Hunter, JJ., concur."

    "Hunter, J.\nThis is an unlawful detainer action in which the plaintiff (respondent), Ronald D. Foisy, is seeking the possession of his real property, unpaid rent and damages. The defendant (appellant), Richard Kent Wyman, appeals from a judgment in favor of the plaintiff.\nIn his complaint, the plaintiff alleged in effect; (1) That on December 31, 1970, the defendant took possession of a house which the plaintiff is seeking to recover, pursuant to a 6-month lease requiring $300 to be paid for said term, plus water and other utility charges; (2) that during the term of the lease the defendant paid the sum of $95, leaving $205 still owing for the 6-month period; (3) that the defendant remained upon the premises after the expiration of the lease; (4) that the rental payment after the expiration of the lease was to be $75 per month; (5) that after the defendant refused to pay the accrued rent, the plaintiff served a 3-day notice to pay rent or vacate upon the defendant on August 27, 1971; (6) that the defendant failed to pay any of the amounts owing after the 3-day notice was served upon him.\nThe defendant\u2019s answer raised several affirmative defenses including breach of implied warranty of habitability.\nDuring trial the defendant testified that he took possession of the house on March 3, 1971. It appears that the parties executed the lease in question on March 8, 1971, although the lease was dated December 31, 1970, and was to cover a term of 6 months, which was to commence on January 1,1971, and end on June 30,1971.\nThe lease in question also contained an option to purchase. The testimony of the defendant indicates that he thought he was purchasing the house rather than renting it. His testimony also indicates that the house contained a number of defects when he entered into the lease and it indicates that he was aware of some of the defects when he agreed to rent the house, but not all of them.\nThe trial court concluded that the defendant was guilty of unlawful detainer of the premises rented to him by the plaintiff. However, it refused to enforce the provisions of what it termed the \u201cpurported lease.\u201d It found that the reasonable rental for the period of occupancy of the premises was the sum of $50 per month commencing with March 3, 1971, until such time as the defendant removed himself. In effect, the court held the lease was invalid. The court also held that a writ of restitution should issue to the sheriff to require the surrender of possession if the defendant did not voluntarily withdraw and that damages for the period March 3, 1971, through April 3, 1972, were to be doubled if the defendant did not surrender the premises by April 3, 1972. The defendant appeals, although the plaintiff does not cross-appeal from the court\u2019s findings.\nThe primary contention raised by the defendant is that the trial court erred in refusing to accept evidence as to his affirmative defense of breach of implied warranty of habitability. The defendant argues that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to maintain the premises in a habitable condition constitutes a failure of consideration upon the part of the plaintiff and relieves the defendant of his obligation to pay rent. We agree that the tenant should have been permitted to introduce evidence at trial in support of this theory of defense.\nThe premises in question, according to the testimony of the defendant, contained a number of defects including a lack of heat, no hot water tank, broken windows, a broken door, water running through the bedroom, an improperly seated and leaking toilet, a leaking sink in the bathroom, broken water pipes in the yard and termites in the basement. No objection was made to the introduction of this testimony. The testimony of the defendant also indicates that he painted the interior and made repairs upon the premises, but ceased making repairs when he learned of a municipal court action being initiated against the plaintiff as a result of numerous housing code violations within the house. In addition, the record reveals that the landlord was informed of the defects and was prosecuted successfully for violations of the Seattle housing code.\nDuring the trial the defendant attempted to introduce the testimony of two housing inspectors as to the housing code violations which existed on the premises. The trial court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s objections to this testimony upon the theory that the condition of the premises was not relevant to the issue before the court. We disagree with the reasoning of the trial court in refusing to accept the evidence as to the condition of the premises, although it should be stated that this issue has not been heretofore specifically addressed in this jurisdiction in relation to our unlawful detainer statutes.\nThroughout the United States, the old rule of caveat emptof in the leasing of premises has been undergoing judicial scrutiny.\nIn Pines v. Perssion, 14 Wis. 2d 590, 596, 111 N.W.2d 409 (1961), the court stated:\nTo follow the old rule of no implied warranty of habitability in leases would, in our opinion, be inconsistent with the current legislative policy concerning housing standards. The need and social desirability of adequate housing for people in this era of rapid population increases is too important to be rebuffed by that obnoxious legal clich\u00e9, caveat emptor. Permitting landlords to rent \u201ctumble-down\u201d houses is at least a contributing cause of such problems as urban blight, juvenile delinquency, and high property taxes for conscientious landowners.\nSee Reste Realty Corp. v. Cooper, 53 N.J. 444, 251 A.2d 268 (1969); Marini v. Ireland, 56 N.J. 130, 265 A.2d 526 (1970); Lemle v. Breeden, 51 Hawaii 426, 462 P.2d 470 (1969); Javins v. First Nat\u2019l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925, 27 L. Ed. 2d 185, 91 S. Ct. 186 (1970), and Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill. 2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).\nIn Lemle v. Breeden, supra, the court reviewed the rule of caveat emptor and the current trend toward finding an implied warranty of habitability in leases, and stated on page 433:\nThe application of an implied warranty of habitability in leases gives recognition to the changes in leasing transactions today. It affirms the fact that a lease is, in essence, a sale as well as a transfer of an estate in land and is, more importantly, a contractual relationship. From that contractual relationship an implied warranty of habitability and fitness for the purposes intended is a just and necessary implication. It is a doctrine which has its counterparts in the law of sales and torts and one which when candidly countenanced is impelled by the nature of the transaction and contemporary housing realities. Legal fictions and artificial exceptions to wooden rules of property law aside, we hold that in the lease of a dwelling house, such as in this case, there is an implied warranty of habitability and fitness for the use intended.\n(Footnote omitted.)\nIn Javins v. First Nat\u2019l Realty Corp., supra, the court analyzed the various exceptions to the common-law rule that the lessor has no duty to repair and stated on page 1078:\nThese as well as other similar cases demonstrate that some courts began some time ago to question the common law\u2019s assumptions that the land was the most important feature of a leasehold and that the tenant could feasibly make any necessary repairs himself. Where those assumptions no longer reflect contemporary housing patterns, the courts have created exceptions to the general rule that landlords have no duty to keep their premises in repair.\nIt is overdue for courts to admit that these assumptions are no longer true with regard to all urban housing. Today\u2019s urban tenants, the vast majority of whom live in multiple dwelling houses, are interested, not in the land, but solely in \u201ca house suitable for occupation.\u201d Furthermore, today\u2019s city dweller usually has a single, specialized skill unrelated to maintenance work; he is unable to make repairs like the \u201cjack-of-all-trades\u201d farmer who was the common law\u2019s model of the lessee. Further, unlike his agrarian predecessor who often remained on one piece of land for his entire life, urban tenants today are more mobile than ever before. A tenant\u2019s tenure in a specific apartment will often not be sufficient to justify efforts at repairs. In addition, the increasing complexity of today\u2019s dwellings renders them much more difficult to repair than the structures of earlier times. In a multiple dwelling repair may require access to equipment and areas in the control of the landlord. Low and middle income tenants, even if they were interested in making repairs, would be unable to obtain any financing for major repairs since they have no long-term interest in the property.\n(Footnotes omitted.)\nWe find the reasoning of these cases extremely persuasive. Any realistic analysis of the lessor-lessee or landlord-tenant situation leads to the conclusion that the tenant\u2019s promise to pay rent is in exchange for the landlord\u2019s promise to provide a livable dwelling. As Judge Skelly Wright stated in the Javins case on page 1074:\nWhen American city dwellers, both rich and poor, seek \u201cshelter\u201d today, they seek a well known package of goods and services \u2014 a package which includes not merely walls and ceilings, but also adequate heat, light and ventilation, serviceable plumbing facilities, secure windows and doors, proper sanitation, and proper maintenance.\n(Footnote omitted.) Javins v. First Nat'l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925, 27 L. Ed. 2d 185, 91 S. Ct. 186 (1970). The value of the lease today then, whether it is oral or written, is that it gives the tenant a place to live, and he expects not just space but a dwelling that protects him from the elements of the environment without subjecting him to health hazards.\nIn House v. Thornton, 76 Wn.2d 428, 457 P.2d 199 (1969), we rejected the doctrine of caveat emptor as it applied to the sale of a new residence and found an implied warranty that the structure is fit for the buyer\u2019s intended purpose. In doing so, we noted that the old rule of caveat emptor has little relevance to the sale of a brand-new house by a vendor-builder to a first buyer for the purposes of occupancy. By analogy, the old rule of caveat emptor has little relevance to the renting of premises in our society. There can be little justification for following a rule that was developed for an agrarian society and has failed to keep pace with modern day realities. We therefore hold that in all contracts for the renting of premises, oral or written, there is an implied warranty of habitability and breach of this warranty constitutes a defense in an unlawful detainer action. See Javins v. First Nat\u2019l Realty Corp., supra; Lund v. MacArthur, 51 Hawaii 473, 462 P.2d 482 (1969); Marini v. Ireland, 56 N.J. 130, 265 A.2d 526 (1970); Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill. 2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).\nIt can be argued, however, that the defendant should not be entitled to the protection of an implied warranty of habitability since he knew of a substantial number of defects when he rented the premises and the rent was reduced from $87 per month to $50 per month. We believe this type of bargaining by the landlord with the tenant is contrary to public policy and the purpose of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability. A disadvantaged tenant should not be placed in a position of agreeing to live in an uninhabitable premises. Housing conditions, such as the record indicates exist in the instant case, are a health hazard, not only to the individual tenant, but to the community which is exposed to said individual. As the court recognized in Pines v. Perssion, supra, such housing conditions are at least a contributing cause of such problems as urban blight, juvenile delinquency and high property taxes for the conscientious landowners.\nOur belief that public policy demands such a result is reinforced by our review of Laws of 1973, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 207, which became effective July 16, 1973. The legislature in passing this bill and the Governor in signing it have recognized that public policy demands this result. Laws of 1973, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 207, provides in part:\nSec. 6. The landlord will at all times during the tenancy keep the premises fit for human habitation, and shall in particular:\n(1) Maintain the premises to substantially comply with any applicable code, statute, ordinance, or regulation governing their maintenance or operation, which the legislative body enacting the applicable code, statute, ordinance or regulation could enforce as to the premises rented;\n(2) Maintain the roofs, floors, walls, chimneys, fireplaces, foundations, and all other structural components in reasonably good repair so as to be usable and capable of resisting any and all normal forces and loads to which they may be subjected;\n(5) Except where the condition is attributable to normal wear and tear, make repairs and arrangements necessary to put and keep the premises in as good condition as it by law or rental agreement should have been, at the commencement of the tenancy;\n(7) Maintain all electrical, plumbing, heating, and other facilities and appliances supplied by him in reasonably good working order;\n(8) Maintain the dwelling unit in reasonably weather-tight condition;\n(10) Except where the building is not equipped for the purpose, provide facilities adequate to supply heat and water and hot water as reasonably required by the tenant;\nSec. 8. The tenant shall be current in the payment of rent before exercising any of th\u00e9 remedies accorded him under the provisions of this chapter: Provided, That this section shall not be construed as limiting the tenant\u2019s civil remedies for negligent or intentional damages: Provided Further, That this section shall not be construed as limiting the tenant\u2019s right in an unlawful detainer proceeding to raise the defense that there is no rent due and owing.\nSec. 10.\n(6) Nothing in this section shall prevent the tenant from agreeing with the landlord to undertake the repairs himself in return for cash payment or a reasonable reduction in rent, the agreement thereof to be agreed upon between the parties, and such agreement does not alter the landlord\u2019s obligations under this chapter.\nIt may also be argued that the defendant should not be afforded the protection of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability since the defendant signed a lease which contained an option to purchase. However, as heretofore stated, the trial court failed to recognize the validity of the lease. There is no cross-appeal from this determination and we are therefore bound by the trial court\u2019s decision.\nThe plaintiff argues that the trial court was correct in disregarding the Seattle housing code as it was improperly pleaded and no properly authenticated copy of the housing code was offered. These issues were not before the court when it rejected the testimony of the housing inspectors. It was not until after the court had rejected the testimony of the housing inspectors on the basis of their testimony being irrelevant that the housing code was offered into evidence. Had the court rejected the housing code on the grounds suggested by the plaintiff, the defendant would have been in a position to move to amend his pleadings. The argument as to the housing code not being properly authenticated, we believe, is without merit in view of RCW 5.44.080 which states:\nWhen the ordinances of any city or town are printed by authority of such municipal corporation, the printed copies thereof shall be received as prima facie evidence that such ordinances as printed and published were duly passed.\nThe copy of the housing code that was offered into evidence by the defendant is printed by authority of the City of Seattle and is therefore prima facie evidence that the ordinances as printed and published were duly passed.\nThe testimony relating to the housing code violations should have been admitted into evidence, and the trial court erred in ruling that the condition of the premises was not relevant to the issue of rent due and owing. While the housing code violations in and of themselves do not establish a prima facie case that the premises are uninhabitable, they are evidence which aids in establishing that the premises are uninhabitable.\nThe plaintiff argues, in effect, however, that the unlawful detainer statutes are not designed for defenses such as breach of implied warranty of habitability due to the nature of the action. In light of our previous discussion, we believe this to be without merit.\nOne of the basic issues in an unlawful detainer action of this nature is whether or not there is any rent due. RCW 59.12.170, which governs the entry of judgment and execution in an unlawful detainer action, states that upon a finding of default in the payment of rent, \u201cthe judgment shall also declare the forfeiture of the lease, agreement or tenancy.\u201d RCW 59.12.030 provides:\nA tenant of real property for a term less than life is guilty of unlawful detainer either:\n(3) When he continues in possession in person or by subtenant after a default in the payment of rent, and after notice in writing requiring in the alternative the payment of the rent or the surrender of the detained premises . . .\nSince the affirmative defense of breach of implied warranty of habitability goes directly to the issue of rent due and owing, which is one of the basic issues in an unlawful detainer action as the above statutes indicate, we now hold said defense is available in an unlawful detainer action of this nature. See Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill. 2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).\nThe defendant also contends that the trial court erred in rendering judgment in the instant case, since the amount demanded in the 3-day notice was more than the trial court found was actually due and owing. We disagree.\nIn Provident Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Thrower, 155 Wash. 613, 617, 285 P. 654 (1930), we stated:\nAs to the form and contents of the notice or demand, a substantial compliance with the statute is sufficient.\nSee Sowers v. Lewis, 49 Wn.2d 891, 307 P.2d 1064 (1957). See also Erz v. Reese, 157 Wash. 32, 288 P. 255 (1930) (wherein we stated on page 35 that \u201cwe have never adopted the strictest rule of construction as to the form or contents of such notices under our unlawful detainer statutes, chiefly for the reason, doubtless, that the statutes prescribe no form.\u201d). In the Provident Mutual case the notice was defective in three respects: (1) It contained the signature of the agent rather than the owner; (2) it overstated the amount of rent due by $165 as found by the trial court; and (3) it defectively described the premises. Although we did not specifically address the issue of the overstatement of the amount of rent due, we did hold the notice substantially complied with the requirements of Rem. Comp. Stat. \u00a7 812 (now RCW 59.12.030).\nIn the instant case, the 3-day notice to pay rent or vacate the premises that was served upon the defendant called for the payment of $205, the balance due under the lease, plus $75 per month for July and August. There was no dispute as to the monthly rental payment under the terms of the purported lease; however, there was a conflict as to the amount of the monthly rental due for the months of July and August. The plaintiff testified the rent for those months was to be $75 per month, and the defendant testified that it was to be $50 per month. It appears that the plaintiff\u2019s demand for rental in the notice was in conformity with his good faith determination as to the amount of rental due, and that the defendant was not prejudiced as he could have tendered to the plaintiff the amount of rental due according to his understanding, of the agreement. See C. J. Peck, Landlord and Tenant Notices, 31 Wash. L. Rev. 51, 61 (1956). In tendering the amount due to the plaintiff, of"

    "Steinert, J.\nThe owner and lessor of certain premises brought suit against a number of defendants for breach of covenant of a lease, seeking in the action to recover the cost of repairing a furnace located in the leased property. The defendants, consisting of the tenant in possession and certain prior tenants, all being connected with and concerned in the lease, answered separately, denying liability.\nThe cause proceeded to trial before a jury. Defendants\u2019 motion for dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s case at the close of its evidence, and plaintiff\u2019s subsequent motion for a directed verdict, were each denied. The jury returned a verdict in favor of all of the defendants. Plaintiff moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, for a new trial. The court granted the first of these motions and entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff against all of the defendants, in the amount of the cost of the repairs, together with an attorney\u2019s fee as provided for in the lease; the judgment further directed that, if any part of the award should be paid by any of the prior tenants, such person should have judgment to that extent against the tenant in possession. From that judgment, the possessory tenant alone appealed.\nRespondent, Publishers Building Company, is the owner of a three-story building, known as the Gandy block, in Spokane. The ground floor of the building is divided into store rooms and is used for store purposes. The second and third floors are fitted for and used as a hotel, in the basement of the building is a furnace room equipped with a cast iron sectional boiler, by means of which the entire building is heated.\nOn August 31,1942, the respondent entered into a written lease with defendants Carl Altin, William Y. McKnight, and Mayme C. McKnight, the wife of William V. McKnight, whereby respondent leased to Altin and the McKnights, denominated \u201clessee,\u201d the second and third floors, together with the basement furnace room of the building, to be used as a hotel only, for a term of three years beginning September 1, 1942, and ending August 31, 1945.\nThe material portions of the lease, so far as this action is concerned, read as follows:\n\u201cLessee [s] agrees to furnish heat for the storerooms on the first floor of the building in which the leased premises are situated, at Lessee\u2019s sole expense. . . .\n\u201cLessee agrees ... at his own expense ... to keep the premises, including plumbing, in good repair, and to save Lessor harmless from any damage or claim of damage due directly or indirectly tp the condition of the premises, including damage resulting from plumbing or in any manner from pipes or coils of any and all kinds, or by reason of snow, ice or other obstructions, and should Lessee neglect or fail to comply with each, all and every of the covenants, conditions or requirements just specified, Lessor may, at his option, in addition to any other right he [it] may have, cause the same to be done and all costs and expenses incident thereto shall be paid by Lessee. Lessee agrees at the end of the term to quit and surrender the premises in good and clean condition (reasonable wear and damage by fire excepted)....\n\u201cLessee accepts the premises herein leased in their present condition, and without any agreement, promises or representations, and acknowledges that he is acting entirely on his own judgment, and not relying on any representations, promises or agreements made to him.\u201d\nIt will be noted that the lease specifically provides (1) that the \u201clessee\u201d agrees, at his sole expense, to furnish heat to the store rooms on the first floor of the building; (2) that he agrees, at his own expense, to keep the premises in good repair and (3) save the lessor harmless from any damage or claim of damage due directly or indirectly to the condition of the premises; (4) that should the lessee neglect or fail to comply with each or all of the covenants, conditions, or requirements previously specified, the lessor may at its option \u201ccause the same to be done\u201d at the expense of the lessee; (5) that the lessee agrees at the end of the term to quit and surrender the premises in good and clean condition, reasonable wear and damage by fire excepted; and (6) that the lessee accepts the premises in their condition as of the time of the execution of the lease, acknowledging that he was acting entirely on his own judgment and not relying on any representations, promises, or agreements made to him.\nOn December 1, 1942, the named lessees, Altin and the McKnights, in writing assigned the lease to the defendants E. W. Skerrett and Hazel O. Skerrett, his wife. The assignment, which was subscribed by both the assignors and the assignees, obligated all of the parties thereto to perform all of the covenants, provisions, and conditions of the lease.\nOn June 1, 1943, the defendants McKnight and Skerrett by a similar writing assigned the lease to the appellant herein, Marie Miller, with like obligations imposed upon the parties thereto. Appellant took possession of the premises and was in charge thereof at the time of the occurrence of the event hereinafter related and also at the time of the trial of this action in April, 1945, which was nearly five months prior to the expiration of the term of the lease.\nIn the furnace room of the basement was a boiler which had been installed about ten years previously and which, according to the evidence, would with proper care have lasted practically a lifetime. The boiler was of the cast iron type, consisting of eleven sections, and was equipped with the usual gauge and petcocks on the side thereof. A fireman was regularly employed by the appellant to operate the furnace and thereby produce heat for the entire building, including both the hotel and the store rooms on the ground floor. The particular fireman involved in this case, Jess McDonald, had been in the employ of the appellant for only about a week at the time of the occurrence here in question.\nLate in the afternoon of February 10, 1944, McDonald fired the furnace and shortly thereafter went up to one of the rooms in the hotel on some errand. On his return about thirty minutes later, he discovered that the front of the boiler was cracked, and that no water stood in the gauge. In that condition, the furnace could not be operated. Respondent\u2019s rental agent was immediately notified, and, at his direction a plumbing and heating concern sent its men to look into and, if possible, remedy the situation. The furnace was taken apart that evening, and it was then found that four sections of the boiler had been damaged to such an extent as to require replacement with new sections.\nThere is no dispute as to the fact that the damage was caused by the lack of water in the boiler after the furnace was fired, although there is a serious dispute as to what caused the water to run low and as to just when the gauge reflected that condition. Upon that question, it is the contention of the respondent that appellant\u2019s fireman negligently fired the furnace at a time when there was little or no water in the boiler, and that an observation of the gauge or a turn of the petcocks would have readily disclosed to him the condition. Appellant\u2019s evidence was to the effect that, at the time the furnace was fired, the gauge showed water standing at the proper height, and she claims that the damage was due either to a structurally defective, or else a worn-out, condition of the boiler.\nIn view of the fact that heat had to be supplied immediately for the various parts of the building and that permanent repairs could not be made at that time, the cracks were temporarily cemented, at an expense of approximately eighty dollars, which was paid by the respondent. Later, in the summer of 1944, while appellant was still in possession of the premises, respondent, through a contractor, made permanent repairs by replacing the four damaged sections of the boiler with new ones, at a cost of approximately $717, which the respondent also paid.\nAsserting its claimed rights under the lease, respondent made demand upon the appellant and upon the respective predecessor tenants, defendants herein, for reimbursement of the total amount so expended by it. They, however, disclaimed all liability and refused to comply with the demand. Respondent thereupon instituted this action.\nRespondent\u2019s complaint is based upon a dual theory or, more precisely, upon a specific theory emphasized by a contributing factor. The complaint alleged (1) a breach of the covenant to repair contained in the lease, and (2) negligence on the part of appellant\u2019s employee, McDonald, in firing the furnace at a time when water was absent from, or low in, the boiler, thereby causing the damage.\nThe evidence in the case, as reflected by the testimony of the witnesses, was for the most part directed to the question of negligence on the part of the fireman. There was evidence on that issue which, in our opinion, would have fully warranted a finding either way, that is, that the fireman was negligent or, on the contrary, that he was not negligent. That issue was submitted to the jury, and its verdict established the fact, so far as this case is concerned, that the fireman was not negligent. We will therefore not discuss that question any further, but will confine ourselves to the question of the rights and duties of the parties under the terms of the lease and the covenants therein.\nThe question for our consideration is purely one of law, involving an interpretation of the lease and \u00e1 determination of the obligation and responsibility of the tenant under the particular covenants thereof.\nAs previously stated, appellant was required, by the terms of the lease agreement, to furnish heat for the store rooms on the first floor of the building. That was part of the consideration for the execution of the lease by the respondent. It was also, of course, th\u00e9 responsibility of the appellant to furnish heat to the occupants of the hotel conducted by her in the same building. To accomplish those purposes satisfactorily, it was necessary that the furnace, or boiler, be kept in a good state of repair; for, otherwise,- adequate heat could not be furnished to the tenants of the store rooms or to the occupant guests of the hotel.\nRespondent took pains to incorporate in the lease, and the appellant by her written acceptance of the assignment thereof bound herself to perform, a covenant whereby she as lessee agreed, at her own expense, to keep the premises \u201cin good repair.\u201d The boiler was located in the basement furnace room and, with its pipes and other connections, constituted a part of the premises which were leased to the appellant. The respondent took further pains expressly to reheve itself of any suggestion or implication that it would, or was required to, make any changes in or repair to the boiler, for it was specifically provided that the lessee accepted the premises in their then condition, acknowledging that she was acting entirely on her own judgment and not relying on any representations, promises, or agreements made to her. In other words, she voluntarily placed herself in a position to which the maxim of caveat emptor is applicable. Robinson v. Wilson, 102 Wash. 528, 173 Pac. 331; Arnold-Evans Co. v. Hardung, 132 Wash. 426, 232 Pac. 290, 45 A. L. R. 9.\nThe specific provision in the lease which obligated the lessee to keep the premises in good repair was a general covenant to repair. The other covenants, quoted and enumerated above, lend added weight to the general covenant.\nIn the absence of any qualifying language, a general covenant of a tenant to repair obligates him to make all necessary repairs, even to the point of rebuilding in case the premises are destroyed.\nIn the early case of Armstrong v. Maybee, 17 Wash. 24, 48 Pac. 737, 61 Am. St. 898, this court had occasion to examine and state the law upon the subject. In that case, the plaintiff leased to the defendant a shingle mill, mill grounds, mill machinery, a dryhouse, office, and office fixtures for a term of about fifteen months. The lease contained the following covenant:\n\u201cThe lessee shall maintain all of the machinery and buildings of said mill in as good condition and repair as the same now are in and return the same to the lessor at the expiration of said lease in as good condition as the same are now in, \u25a0 reasonable wear and tear excepted. . . . That he (lessee) will maintain all the said mill, machinery and buildings in as good condition and repair as the same are now in, and return the same to lessor at the expiration or termination of this lease in as good condition as the same are now in, reasonable wear and tear from ordinary use alone excepted.\u201d\nAbout five months after the execution of the lease, the mill was entirely destroyed by fire. Upon defendant\u2019s failure to rebuild the mill or compensate for its loss, plaintiff brought suit for breach of covenant of the lease and, in his complaint, alleged that the fire was caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence.\nOn appeal by the defendant from an adverse judgment, the error assigned in that case had reference to an instruction given by the trial court to the effect that the covenant above quoted imposed an obligation on the defendant to rebuild the buildings and the mill in the event they were burned during his tenancy. In approving that instruction, this court held that the terms of the covenant constituted an express covenant to repair, and then defined the effect of such a covenant by stating the approved rule as expressed by Taylor on Landlord and Tenant (8th ed.), \u00a7 364, as follows:\n\u201c \u2018Under an express covenant to repair, the lessee\u2019s liability is not confined to cases of ordinary and gradual decay, but extends to injuries done to the property by fire, although accidental; and even if the premises are entirely consumed, he is still bound to repair within a reasonable time. And the principle applies to all damages occasioned by a public enemy, or by a mob, flood, or tempest. Thus, where the covenant is to repair in general terms, or to repair, uphold and support, or however otherwise phrased, if it undertakes the duty of repair, it binds the lessee to rebuild if the premises are destroyed. For this reason, and in order to afford some protection to the tenant, it is customary to introduce into the covenant to repair, an exception against accidents by fire, tempest, or lightning.\u2019 \u201d\nOn the same subject, the court quoted the following paragraph from Wood on Landlord and Tenant (2d ed.), \u00a7 370:\n\u201cTf a lessee covenants to repair and keep the premises in repair during the term, not excepting damage by fire or the elements, he is bound to rebuild them if burnt down by accident, negligence, or otherwise. It is of no importance how the covenant is worded; unless it is qualified, the lessee is bound to rebuild in case the buildings are destroyed by fire or other casualty during the term; the tenant, if the burden of the covenant rests upon him, or the landlord, if he is the covenantor, must rebuild. Thus, a covenant \u201cto repair, uphold and support,\u201d or to \u201cwell and sufficiently repair,\u201d or to keep in repair and leave as found, or to \u201crepair and keep in repair,\u201d to keep in \u201cgood repair, natural wear and tear excepted,\u201d to make \u201call necessary repairs,\u201d to deliver up \u201cin tenantable repair,\u201d or to \u201cdeliver up the premises in as good a condition as they now are,\u201d all impose upon the covenantor the duty of rebuilding or restoring premises destroyed or injured by the elements.\u2019 \u201d\nThe case at bar is stronger than the cited case, in that, here, the covenant of the appellant to keep the premises in good repair and surrender them in good condition was positive, regardless of the condition of the premises at the time the lease was executed, whereas, in the cited case, the tenant was required only to maintain and return the premises in as good condition and repair as obtained at the time of the execution of the lease. Although, in this case, the boiler cracked because of its exposure to the heat from the firebox, it is not here contended that the \u201cdamage by fire\u201d exception contained in the lease is applicable to the situation with which we are presently concerned.\nIf, under the rule as above stated, a covenant to repair obligates a tenant to rebuild premises in the event they are utterly destroyed by fire or other casualty (in the absence of some expressed exception in the covenant), then for stronger reason the same rule would require him to repair such portion of the premises as has been only partly damaged by some fortuity.\nIn the later case of Arnold-Evans Co. v. Hardung, 132 Wash. 426, 232 Pac. 290, 45 A. L. R. 9, the situation was very similar to the one presented here, although in that case the question arose upon a cross-complaint by the tenant against the landlord, rather than upon a complaint by the landlord against the tenant, for recovery of the cost of repairing a boiler located in the leased premises. The facts in the cited case were these: J. A. Hardung leased an apartment house to W. E. Bonza and wife for a term of one year. The lease contained a provision reading as follows:\n\u201cAnd It Is Hereby Agreed, that the parties of the second part [lessees] are to maintain and keep said building in good repair and return same at the expiration of this lease to the party of the first part [lessor], its heirs, administrators or assigns in as good condition as at the present time, excepting that first party will make repairs to the exterior of premises occasioned by reasonable use and wear thereof.\u201d\nEarly one morning in January, the boiler of the heating plant in the leased building was found to be leaking badly, and, on examination, it was discovered that the bottom of the boiler had rusted out, so that it was beyond repair, and that a new boiler was absolutely necessary. The building was then occupied by guests and tenants who required heat for their comfort and well being, and something had to be done immediately. Bonza, one of the lessees, telegraphed to Hardung, the lessor, a nonresident, advising him with regard to the situation, and then, without awaiting a reply to his telegram, ordered a new boiler installed for Hardung at an expense of $939.25. Thereafter, the heating contractor, not having been paid for the boiler, brought suit against both the lessor and the lessees. The lessees cross-complained against the lessor, asking that, if they were held liable to the plaintiff, they might have judgment over against the lessor. Upon the trial, the court found in favor of the plaintiff and against the lessees, who thereafter appealed.\nIn affirming the judgment, this court said:\n\u201cAppellants urge, and the evidence tends to show, that this was not an ordinary repair, since it was testified that with proper care the new boiler would last practically a lifetime, and authorities are cited which distinguish between repairs and renewals or replacements. But, as we read the covenant, it is not simply a covenant to make ordinary repairs. The words: \u2018to maintain and keep said building in good repair and return same at the expiration of this lease to the party of the first part, . . . in as good condition as at the present time, excepting that first party will make repairs to the exterior of premises occasioned by reasonable use and wear thereof/ when construed as a whole, and effect given to every part, seem beyond cavil to bear only the meaning which the trial court evidently ascribed to them.\n\u201c \u2018It is the well settled common law rule that a tenant\u2019s general covenant to repair the demised premises binds him under all circumstances, even though the injury proceeds from an act of God, from the elements, or from the act of a stranger, and if he desires to relieve himself from liability for injuries resulting from any of the causes above enumerated, or from any other cause whatever, he must take care to except them from the operation of his covenant.

    "Dore, J.\nThis appeal involves the declaratory judgment action of Allen Lane Carr, Inc., P.S., and McGary, Wood-burne and Cole, a partnership, against Westlake Investors, a limited partnership, to determine their rights under commercial l\u00e9ases they entered into with Westlake. The trial court entered judgment in favor of Westlake. Carr alone appeals, alleging errors in interpreting the lease renewal clause; the assessment of fees for lessee's parking spaces at the building; and attorney fees. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court, holding that Westlake was not barred from increasing rent for a 3-year renewal term; that Carr was not entitled to free parking; and that the trial court correctly awarded attorney fees. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\nI\nBeginning October 1, 1973, Westlake leased space in an office building to Carr and McGary for law offices. The Carr and McGary law firms shared space on one of the floors in the building and jointly negotiated their respective individual leases with Westlake. Carr's lease with Westlake contains the following clause:\nIf this lease be for a longer term than thirty-six months, the rental hereunder shall, at the end of thirty-six months ... be subject to rental adjustment by Lessor, as follows: If, whether because of increased operating costs of the premises or otherwise, Lessor should determine an increase of rental rate to be necessary, Lessor shall so notify Lessee by notice in writing addressed to Lessee at the premises and including a statement of the adjusted rental to apply, such notice to be given at least 90 days in advance of the expiration of the 36-month period as aforesaid, and to be effective on the first day of the rental month immediately following such 36-month period.\n(1) If Lessee objects to such increased rental rate, . . . then the revised rental rate shall be determined by a board of arbitrators . . .\nClerk's Papers, at 58. At the place underlined, the word \"sixty\" was whited out and the figure \"90\" inserted. This change was not initialed by the parties on the lease as consummated.\nThe lease also provides that if the lessee objected to the increased rental, the rental would be settled by arbitration. A further clause of the lease provides that:\nThe Lessor guarantees the Lessee the use of 2 executive parking stalls in the building parking lot.\nClerk's Papers, at 59. The figure \"2\" was typed into a blank.\nThe lease further provides in revised typed lease addendum 4 as follows:\n7. The Lessee shall have the option to renew the lease for six (6) consecutive three year periods, provided lessee gives lessor written notice of their intention to exercise each such option not less than sixty (60) days prior to the expiration date of the lease or any extended period thereof; provided, however, that the monthly rental in the case of each such extension of the lease shall be at the rate to be negotiated between lessor and lessee, shall in no event be less than the monthly rental for the last month preceding such renewal period, and if the lessor and lessee are unable to agree as to the fair market rental value of the premises at the time of commencement of any such extension period, then the revised rental rate shall be determined by a board of arbitrators in accordance with the procedure provided above on page 1 of this lease.\nClerk's Papers, at 63-64.\nIn their testimony at trial, Carr and McGary gave the following account of the background of the renewal provision. Sometime prior to the execution of the original leases between the Carr and McGary firms and Westlake, the parties entered into different lease documents, signed by Carr, McGary and the partners of Westlake. The leases were negotiated by a real estate broker directly with the partners of Westlake who signed the leases as the lessor. The manager of the building was not available at the time of the consummation of the original Carr lease. Upon his return, he took exception to the terms of the leases and a dispute ensued, culminating in Westlake's disavowal of the lease agreements, pursuant to a letter written by counsel for Westlake.\nProtracted negotiations were then commenced between the parties, and ultimately the lease documents with which we are now concerned were signed. The fundamental change between the initial lease and the present one was that the former was for an initial period of 5 years with additional options of 5 years. At the time of the negotiation of the new leases, Carr requested and was granted the right to change the terms of his lease from 5 years to 3 years. According to their testimony, Carr and McGary requested that the notice-of-rental-increase provision in both leases be changed to at least 90 days in advance rather than the 60 days provided for in the original lease. At the time the lease term began, Westlake did not charge any of its tenants for parking. In July 1974, Westlake began charging most of its tenants for parking but still did not charge Carr rental for his two parking stalls.\nOn July 30, 1976, approximately 60 days prior to the end of the lease, Carr gave notice that he wanted to exercise his option to renew. He was then informed there would be a rental increase. Discussions regarding the amount of the increase reached an impasse, at which point arbitration was pursued. An arbitration award was made, fixing the fair market rental value in the same amount as Westlake had previously requested. Carr paid the increased amount under protest, pending review of his legal contention that Westlake was not entitled to any rental increase because it had failed to give 90 days' notice of the proposed rental increase and, therefore, lessor waived its right to raise rentals for the first 3-year option agreement.\nII\nWe initially address Westlake's contention that the issues presented on appeal are rendered moot by the lessor's recent unlawful detainer judgment against the lessee, which forfeited the Carr lease and forced him out of the leased premises. This analysis ignores the monetary stake Carr still has in this action. He recently was billed for more than $1,800 in parking rent and owes $4,600 in attorney fees. Obviously this case is not moot.\nIII\nWe next consider the issue of whether Westlake is barred from increasing rent for the 3-year term beginning October 1, 1976, because it failed to give lessee notice of a proposed rental increase at least 90 days prior to the end of the previous term. The 90-day-notice provision applies only if the fixed rental term is greater than 3 years.\nWe are not persuaded by Carr's contention that because the lease was really for longer than 3 years, the 90-day-notice provision applies. The trial court concluded in finding of fact 2.7 that:\nThe intent of the parties to the leases, as expressed in the plain and unambiguous provisions thereof, was that each lease was for a term of thirty-six months only, not longer, with multiple options for renewal under new leases, and not for extensions of the existing leases.\nClerk's Papers, at 18. A finding of fact supported by substantial evidence will not be disturbed by an appellate court. Thorndike v. Hesperian Orchards, Inc., 54 Wn.2d 570, 343 P.2d 183 (1959); McGovern v. Department of Social & Health Servs., 94 Wn.2d 448, 617 P.2d 434 (1980).\nCarr maintains the lease language is ambiguous and the lease should be interpreted as being of longer than a 3-year duration. Generally, the question of whether a written instrument is ambiguous is a question of law for the court. Ladum v. Utility Cartage, Inc., 68 Wn.2d 109, 411 P.2d 868 (1966). An ambiguity will not be read into a contract where it can reasonably be avoided by reading the contract as a whole. Green River Vly. Found., Inc. v. Foster, 78 Wn.2d 245, 249, 473 P.2d 844 (1970). The term \"ambiguous\" has been defined as \"'Capable of being understood in either of two or more possible senses\". Ladum, at 116, quoting Webster's New International Dictionary (2d ed.).\nReading the lease as a whole, we cannot ignore the provisions of lease addendum 4, which the parties specifically negotiated and drafted. The preamble to lease addendum 4 of the Carr lease specifies that \"[t]his addendum is for the purpose of adding additional terms or clarifying terms of the lease ...\" That addendum provides the terms upon which the lease may be renewed, and specifically provides that the rental upon renewal is to be a negotiated item, ultimately subject to arbitration as provided for on page 1 of the lease. No other portion of the provision on page 1 is referenced. Reading the provisions together, the specific language of the addendum providing for a negotiated rate or arbitration must prevail over the general terms of the notice-of-rental-increase provision on page 1. Local 104, Int'l Bhd. of Boilermakers v. International Bhd. of Boilermakers, 28 Wn.2d 536, 183 P.2d 504 (1947).\nThe intent of the parties to the contract is to be gleaned from the document itself, and only if it is ambiguous is parol evidence regarding the parties' actual intent admissible. Poggi v. Tool Research & Eng'g Corp., 75 Wn.2d 356, 451 P.2d 296 (1969). As there is no ambiguity in the document itself, Carr's reliance on evidence regarding his own intent in changing the notice provision is misplaced.\nWe affirm finding of fact 2.7 and hold that the trial court correctly concluded that the lease between the parties was one for a 3-year term with six 3-year options, and that the provision for a 90-day notice of rent increase in the case of a lease longer than 3 years does not apply. Westlake was, therefore, not barred from increasing the rent for the new lease period.\nIV\nWe next consider the question of whether the Carr lease provides two free parking spaces to the lessee. The lease provision \"guarantees the Lessee the use of 2 executive parking stalls in the building parking lot\". Clerk's Papers, at 59. The trial court found that, because the Carr lease was negotiated contemporaneously and jointly with the McGary lease, it should be considered when ascertaining the expressed intent of the parties as to the meaning of the Carr lease. The McGary lease provides for four parking stalls, stating in an addendum that\n[o]f the four executive parking stalls referred to in paragraph 19, page 2 of the lease, two of such stalls shall be held and maintained at the sole cost of the lessor for the use and benefit of the lessee.\nClerk's Papers, at 56.\nThe trial court concluded the term \"guarantee\" as used in the Carr lease is unambiguous in that it provides the lessee with parking. We are persuaded by Carr's contention that the term \"guarantee\" is ambiguous, as it does not specify whether payment is required or whether the parking spaces are free.\nAny ambiguity must be construed against Westlake, the preparer of this provision of the lease document. Wilkins v. Grays Harbor Comm'ty Hosp., 71 Wn.2d 178, 427 P.2d 716 (1967).\nAs the parking provision language is ambiguous, it is appropriate to look at the parol evidence regarding the parties' actual intent. Levy v. North Am. Co. for Life & Health Ins., 90 Wn.2d 846, 586 P.2d 845 (1978); Green River Vly. Found.., Inc. v. Foster, 78 Wn.2d 245, 473 P.2d 844 (1970).\nBoth Carr and McGary testified they understood Carr's two parking spaces were to be provided free of charge, and this testimony was not rebutted. Westlake's building manager testified that he had made no demand on Carr for rent payment for the parking spaces for approximately 4a/2 years, although demand to the other tenants in the building, who were not to receive free parking, was made from the initiation of parking charges shortly after these leases were executed. He also testified that when the parking concession was leased to an independent organization, he gave the names of all the tenants to be billed for parking to the organization, but did not at any time give Carr's name to the organization for billing purposes and Carr was not billed. The parties acted upon the provisions as providing free parking for 41h years before any claim was made that Carr should be paying for his parking spaces, and this claim was not made until after this subject dispute between the parties had arisen.\nAfter a review of the evidence presented in the record, we conclude the trial court erred in holding that the parking privilege granted to Carr was not granted free of charge. We also conclude that Carr's lease must be read independently of McGary's, as it was an independent lease involving different parties. McGary was provided four spaces under the terms of his lease, two of which he paid for and two he received free from lessor.\nV\nFinally, we address the issue of whether the lessor is entitled to reasonable attorney fees. The Carr lease provides:\nIn the event of litigation between the parties hereto declaratory or otherwise, for the enforcement of any of the covenants, terms and conditions of this lease, the losing party shall pay costs thereof and reasonable attorneys' fees which shall be determined and taxed by the court as part of such action.\nClerk's Papers, at 7.\nUnder this provision, if Westlake prevailed, it would be entitled to attorney fees. Under our decision here, however, there is no prevailing party. Consequently, we find the award of attorney fees to either party to be inappropriate.\nConclusion\nWe affirm the Court of Appeals holding that Westlake was not barred from increasing the rent for the 3-year period beginning October 1, 1976. We reverse and set aside those provisions in the Westlake judgment that Carr was required to pay for the parking spaces provided by West-lake, and the award of attorney fees to Westlake in the trial and appellate courts. We award no attorney fees to either party on this appeal to the Supreme Court.\nWilliams, C.J., and Rosellini, Stafford, Utter, Brach-tenbach, Dolliver, Dimmick, and Pearson, JJ., concur."

    "Steinert, J.\nPlaintiffs brought this action to compel specific performance of the extension provision of a lease and to have the court determine the rental value of the premises during the additive portion of the term. The court decreed specific performance and fixed the amount of rental for the sequent period. Defendants have appealed.\nOn July 19, 1933, Amy White leased, for a term of years, to Fred R. Sparger and W. L. Wood, copartners, an unimproved tract of land, described by lot and block number, in the city of Seattle. As consideration for the lease, the lessees covenanted to pay a rental of thirty-six hundred dollars in thirty-six successive monthly installments of fifty dollars each, followed by twenty-four successive monthly installments of seventy-five dollars each, and to construct a building on the premises at their sole cost and expense.\nThere was no provision in the lease denoting the character or value of the building to be constructed. However, it was stipulated that the lessees should not remove from the premises any buildings or improvements constructed thereon; and that, at the expiration of the lease, any such buildings and improvements, whether erected by the lessees or by their successors or transferees, should be and become the sole and exclusive property of the lessor, free and clear of any right, title, interest or equities of the lessees, their successors or transferees.\nThe lease further provided that the lessor should be permitted to sell the premises described, subject to the terms of the lease, at any time that she had a bona fide offer for the sale thereof; but that, in such case, the lessees should have the first opportunity to purchase the property at the same price and upon the same terms as those contained in such bona fide offer. Reciprocally, the lease provided that, if the lessees desired to dispose of the improvements erected upon the property demised, the lessor would consent to a transfer of the lease to the purchaser, but that such transfer should not relieve the lessees from payment of the rentals reserved for the full period of the demise. It was also stipulated that the lessor should pay the taxes and assessments on the real property only, and that the lessees should pay the taxes on the improvements.\nThe following paragraph of the lease is the one out of which this controversy arose:\n\u201cIn the event that the landlord is the owner of this property at the end of this present five (5) year term, and does not desire to sell this property, then the tenants have the right to extend this lease upon its present term with the exception that the rental for the two year extended term shall be at such reasonable monthly rental as the parties hereto shall mutually agree upon.\u201d\nThis paragraph of the lease contained the only reference to the length of the term or to the method by which the rental for the extension period was to be determined.\nIn conclusion, the lease provided that the covenants and agreements therein contained should extend to and be obligatory upon, and inure to the benefit of, not only the lessor and lessees, but also their respective successors, heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns.\nThe lessees entered into possession of the premises and erected thereon, at a cost of approximately five thousand dollars, an imitation log building designed for use as a tavern or restaurant. However, in less than a year the business conducted on the premises by the lessees proved a failure, and, as a result, they assigned all their interest to a commercial agency for the benefit of creditors. A few months later, the lease was assigned to an individual with whom respondent Robert Murray was associated as a silent partner. The business was then conducted as a partnership for about three years, but afterwards was transferred to respondents, who also, became the owners of the lease by assignment. They subsequently added further improvements to the building to the extent of about thirteen hundred dollars in value.\nAmy White, the lessor, died in March, 1937, leaving a will in which the leased property passed, by the residuary clause, to her daughter and grandchildren, all of whom are appellants herein.\nShortly before the expiration of the five-year term, respondents notified appellants, in writing, that they elected to extend the term of the lease, as therein provided, for two additional years, and offered to negotiate the matter of the monthly rent to be paid during the extension period.\nAppellants have not desired, nor offered, to sell the property, but have, in all respects, retained full ownership thereof. In the negotiations concerning the rental during the two-year period, respondents took the position that the reasonable value thereof was seventy-five dollars per month. Appellants would not consider less than two hundred dollars. Respondents thereupon brought this action, and appellants promptly filed a cross-complaint, pleading unlawful detainer and demanding immediate possession of the property.\nAppellants do not now dispute respondents\u2019 right to have the term of the lease extended. The only question here involved is the matter of the reasonable rental to be paid by respondents during the extension period.\nThe point upon which the parties are at issue is whether the monthly amount to be paid should be merely a ground rental, as respondents contend, or whether the computation should take into consideration both the land and the improvements thereon, as appellants contend. The trial court held with respondents.\nThe whole difficulty with the case is that the lease failed to specify the basis upon which the rental for the extension period should be computed.\nAt the outset, it may be stated, that, since there was no agreement to the contrary, the building became, during the course of its erection, a part of the land. Toellner v. McGinnis, 55 Wash. 430, 104 Pac. 641, 24 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1082. That fact, however, is not, of itself, determinative of the particular question with which we are now concerned.\nIt is well settled in this state that a contract of lease must be read as a whole, and, when so read, the intention of the parties must govern. Toellner v. McGinnis, supra; Gates v. Hutchinson Inv. Co., 88 Wash. 522, 153 Pac. 322; Wilsonian Inv. Co. v. Swope, 180 Wash. 35, 38 P. (2d) 399.\nIt is also a familiar rule that, if the provisions of a lease be doubtful, in that they are reasonably capable of more than one interpretation, the court will adopt that interpretation which is the more, or most, favorable to the lessee. Gates v. Hutchinson Inv. Co., supra; Salzer v. Manfredi, 114 Wash. 666, 195 Pac. 1046; Diettrich v. Newberry Co., 172 Wash. 18, 19 P. (2d) 115; National Bank of Commerce of Seattle v. Dunn, 194 Wash. 472, 78 P. (2d) 535.\nThere is no extrinsic evidence in this case which throws any light upon the intention of the original parties to the lease as to the basis upon which the rental for the extension period was to be determined. We must, therefore, look to the lease alone.\nIt will be noted that the lease provided that, conditioned upon continued ownership of the premises by the lessor, the lessees \u201chave the right to extend this lease upon its present term.\u201d Although the lessor died prior to the expiration of the original term, the conditional requirement has been specifically met and satisfied through the operation of that provision which extended the covenants, agreements, and obligations of the lease to the successors, heirs, and assigns of the respective parties. In short, the situation as between the present parties is the same as it would have been were the original lessor and lessees the real parties to this action.\nIt is the generally accepted rule that a covenant for the extension of the term of a lease, at the option of the lessee, operates, upon the exercise of the privilege, as a present demise for the full term to which it may be extended, and not as a demise merely for the shorter period with the privilege of a new lease for the extended term. 16 R. C. L. 885, \u00a7 389; 35 C. J. 1026, \u00a7 160; Tiffany on Landlord and Tenant, 1514 et seq., \u00a7\u00a7 218-219; McAdam on Landlord and Tenant (5th ed.), 710, 711, 726; Jones on Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 337; Underhill on Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 803 et seq. For an interesting discussion of options for extension and of the rule of construction of ambiguous or restrictive provisions of a lease, see Mutual Paper Co. v. Hoague-Sprague Corp., 8 N. E. (2d) (Mass.) 802;\nInasmuch as the respondents herein exercised their option, the covenant for extension operated as a present demise of the land for the full term of seven years. From this it follows that the construction of the building formed part of the consideration, not merely for the original five-year period, but for the entire term as extended. While this conclusion would not of itself necessarily determine the basis upon which the amount of the rental during the extension period was to be fixed, it lends support to the inference that the payment of ground rent only was to continue, but on the basis of its reasonable value at that time.\nThat the lessees, their successors and assigns, had a continuous interest in the improvements, when constructed, is made manifest by the lease itself, for it was only upon the expiration of the lease that the buildings and improvements were to become the sole and exclusive property of the lessor, free and clear of any right, title, interest or equities of the lessees, their successors or transferees. Moreover, the lessees were, and will be, required to pay the taxes on the improvements during the entire term. Furthermore, the lessees were given the right to dispose of the improvements during the term of the lease, subject, of course, to all its other provisions. These considerations, though not decisive of the present question, furnish added support for the conclusion that the amount of rent to be paid during the extension period was to be determined on the basis of ground rent.\nIt may be conceded that appellants\u2019 interpretation of the particular provision is not altogether unreasonable. In support of such interpretation, it might well be argued that respondents\u2019 interest in the improvements terminated at the end of the five-year period because the lessor had the right to sell the property at that time, in which event the lessees could not have exercised an option to extend the lease and, accordingly, would have lost all interest in the improvements, and, in fact, would have had to pay for them as part of the land had they desired to meet the offer of a bona fide prospective purchaser of the property. From this, it might Be concluded that respondents should pay, during the extension period, a rental based upon the value of both the land and the improvements.\nOn the other hand, the interpretation which the respondents insist upon is, we think, equally logical and tenable, for the reasons already given.\nIf we look at the situation confronting the original parties to the lease at the time of its execution, we note that the lessor then had but a bare lot of ground. It may well have been that she was then primarily interested in holding the land as an investment or for its speculative increase in value and, in the meantime, was desirous of having it earn a fair return upon her original investment. As business conditions in the surrounding district improved, the value of the lot would naturally tend to increase. The construction of a building, such as was contemplated by the parties, would no doubt contribute to the general improvement, but, because of its peculiar and temporary character, would not, of itself, add much to the value of the ground. While these considerations are largely conjectural, they have a degree of probability and at least suggest that the lessor\u2019s chief concern was to obtain ground rent for the lot during the entire term of the lease.\nHowever, whatever difference of view there may be as to the interpretation of the instrument, certain it is, we think, that its language calls for construction, and that either of the two interpretations that have been placed upon it might logically and reasonably be advanced and adopted.\nIt was within the power of the lessor to obviate the ambiguity and uncertainty to which the lease was sus-ceptive. It was, therefore, her duty to see that the instrument which she offered to the lessees clearly expressed her intention, whatever that may have been. Under the principle of contra proferentem, we are constrained to adopt that interpretation which is the more favorable to the lessees and hold that the rental should be fixed on the basis of ground rent only.\nUpon the question of the rental value of the land alone, the decision of the trial court is amply supported by the evidence in the case.\nThe decree is affirmed.\nBlake, C. J., Beals, Jeffers, and Geraghty, JJ., concur."

    "Olson, J.\nDefendant appeals from a judgment against him for the value of certain heating equipment, claimed to be trade fixtures, installed by plaintiff during his tenancy of a building under a lease from defendant\u2019s grantor, and allegedly converted by defendant to -his own use by his refusing to permit its removal when the tenancy was terminated.\nThree of defendant\u2019s assignments of error use the phraseology that the court \u201cerred in holding,\u201d and a fourth that it \u201cerred in failing to hold\u201d in accord with certain contentions made by defendant.\nPlaintiff submits that the issues on this appeal are narrowed because these assignments of error do not point out findings of fact by number and description, in compliance with Rule on Appeal 43, 34A Wn. (2d) 47, as amended. Not only is this contention correct, if they be considered as claims of error upon findings of fact, but also the word \u201cholding\u201d is not of definite connotation. It may refer to any ruling of the court during the trial. An assignment of error to a \u201cholding\u201d of the trial court is insufficient to present the making of a finding of fact to this court for review. Edward L. Eyre & Co. v. Hirsch, 36 Wn. (2d) 439, 446, 218 P. (2d) 888 (1950).\nWe consider them in this case as assignments of error upon conclusions of law. Such assignments do not bring up for review the facts found, upon which the conclusions are based. Edward L. Eyre & Co. v. Hirsch, supra, p. 447. We, therefore, accept the trial court\u2019s findings as the established facts of this case. Lopeman v. Gee, 40 Wn. (2d) 586, 587, 245 P. (2d) 183 (1952), and cases cited. This limits our inquiry regarding these claimed errors to the question of whether or not the facts found support the conclusions of law. LeCocq Motors v. Whatcom County, 4 Wn. (2d) 601, 603, 104 P. (2d) 475 (1940).\nThe material facts established by the findings are: That plaintiff was a tenant of a building under a lease from defendant\u2019s grantor; that there was no heating equipment in the building; that the lease provided that the lessee would furnish his own heat; that it was necessary for plaintiff, in the conduct of his business, to heat a portion of the building, and that, with the consent of his lessor, he installed a boiler, an oil burner, and other equipment, in the basement beneath the leased premises; that, when defendant purchased the premises, he assumed the lease and knew that those installations had been made by the plaintiff to carry on his trade and business; that, prior to the expiration of the lease, when plaintiff was about to vacate the premises, defendant notified him not to remove the equipment; that none of the heating equipment was attached to the building, except by ordinary bolts and couplings, and it could have been removed without any damage whatsoever to the building; that plaintiff did not intend to make this equipment a part of the building, and placed it on the premises for the sole purpose of carrying on his trade; that the value of the property converted was one thousand fifty dollars; that the defendant was damaged in the sum of seventy-five dollars because of the manner in which certain property of plaintiff, other than heating equipment, was removed from the building. Parenthetically, we wish to state that we have examined the entire record in this case, and it appears that the evidence does not preponderate against the findings of the trial court.\nUpon these facts, the court concluded that the heating installations were \u201ctrade fixtures\u201d that plaintiff should have been permitted to remove from the premises, and judgment was entered against defendant in the sum of nine hundred seventy-five dollars.\nThe first \u201cholding\u201d attacked by defendant is that the heating installations were trade fixtures and removable by plaintiff. This is a conclusion. It is supported by the established facts and, therefore, not erroneous. The fact is that plaintiff did. not intend that the heating installations made while he was a tenant were to enrich the freehold by becoming a part of the building, but placed them there solely for the purposes of his trade. The intent of the party making the annexation is the cardinal inquiry in determining whether a chattel annexed to the freehold is a trade fixture or part of the realty. Ballard v. Alaska Theatre Co., 93 Wash. 655, 662, 161 Pac. 478 (1916); Whitney v. Hahn, 18 Wn. (2d) 198, 204, 138 P. (2d) 669 (1943), and cases cited. Being trade fixtures, it follows that defendant should have permitted plaintiff to remove them when his lease expired.\nThe other \u201choldings\u201d of the court assigned as error by defendant were not made and entered as conclusions of law by the trial court. No error can be assigned upon an oral statement or written memorandum of the court, as the final decision in an action at law is the judgment signed, based upon the court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Edward L. Eyre & Co. v. Hirsch, supra, p. 446. There is nothing for us to review regarding these claims of error.\nDefendant contends that the court erred in \u201cfailing to hold\u201d that it was the duty of plaintiff, as tenant, to disclose his claims to defendant, an innocent purchaser for value, before his purchase. This conclusion would not have been justified in view of the fact that, when defendant purchased the premises, he knew that plaintiff had made the heating installations to carry on his business. The facts known to defendant were naturally and reasonably connected with, and furnished a clue to, plaintiff\u2019s intention to remove this equipment. With such knowledge, defendant is deemed to have had notice of all facts which reasonable inquiry would disclose. Diimmel v. Morse, 36 Wn. (2d) 344, 348, 218 P. (2d) 334 (1950), and cases cited. The court was not in error, as defendant contends, in this regard.\nDefendant assigns error upon the value of the boiler found, and the measure of damages adopted, by the court. The market value of the boiler and of the other property at the time and place of its conversion by the defendant was the proper measure of recovery. Anstine v. McWilliams, 24 Wn. (2d) 230, 238, 163 P. (2d) 816 (1945); Glaspey v. Prelusky, 36 Wn. (2d) 592, 595, 219 P. (2d) 585 (1950). Whether it be considered that the conversion was ordinary or willful is immaterial here. The amount determined being within the range of the testimony, the finding will not be disturbed. Kenney v. Abraham, 199 Wash. 167, 175, 90 P. (2d) 713 (1939), and case cited.\nDefendant further contends that the award to him for damages to the premises, caused by plaintiff in the removal of his other equipment, should be increased, and, because it is for waste, any amount allowed should be trebled. Defendant made no allegation in his cross-complaint that plaintiff had committed waste. Any allowance in this regard first came into the case when the trial judge, after viewing the premises, discussed it in his oral decision. He properly refused to enter findings or conclusions upon the subject of waste, in the absence of evidence of substantial injury to the freehold. Graffell v. Honeysuckle, 30 Wn. (2d) 390, 398, 191 P. (2d) 858 (1948). The amount awarded was for comparatively minor repairs to the building. Plaintiff has not objected to this allowance, and we find no merit in defendant\u2019s contention regarding it.\nThere is no error in the denial of recovery upon defendant\u2019s second cause of action in his cross-complaint. No useful purpose would be served by a discussion of its allegations. The proof did not sustain them.\nThe denial of defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was proper.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nSchwellenbach, C. J., Hill, Hamley, and Finley, JJ., concur.\nSeptember 26, 1952. Petition for rehearing denied."

    "Blake, C. J.\nThe plaintiffs are the owners of a hotel\u2014building and furnishings\u2014in Harrington. They leased the property to the defendants for a five-year term beginning May 15, 1937, at a monthly rental of fifty dollars, payable in advance on the fifteenth day of each month of the term. The defendants covenanted \u201cto pay . . . the . . . rent in the manner . . . specified.\u201d They defaulted, however, in the payment of the installment of rent due on October 15, 1938.\nSubsequent to that date, they were notified by the lessors to pay the rent within ten days or surrender possession. The defendants did neither. On November 10th, they were served with notice of forfeiture of the lease. In December, this action was commenced for possession of the property and damages.\nThe defendants answered, alleging that they were not in default. This defense rested on two theories: (1) That, by reason of past indulgences on the part of the lessors with respect to the time of payments, the lease was not subject to forfeiture until a reasonable time had elapsed after notice to pay; (2) that the lessees had been compelled to make repairs which the plaintiffs had covenanted by the terms of the lease to make, and that the cost of these repairs exceeded the amount due.\nThe cause came on for trial in March, 1939, with defendants still in possession of the property. After hearing the evidence, the trial court found that the plaintiffs had fulfilled their covenant to make repairs, and that the defendants were in default in payment of rent from October 15, 1938. Judgment was entered awarding the plaintiffs immediate possession of the property and two hundred and fifty dollars damages for wrongful possession by defendants subsequent to the notice of forfeiture and demand for possession served on them on November 10th. The defendants appeal.\nAppellants first contend that the action cannot be maintained because of failure of respondents to bring themselves within the provisions of the unlawful detainer statutes, Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 812 [P. C. \u00a7 7970] et seq. The remedy afforded by that act, however, is not exclusive. Upon allegations of the lessee\u2019s default and wrongful possession, a landlord may still maintain an action in ejectment. Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 785 [P. C. \u00a7 7517]; Gustin v. Klingenberg, 190 Wash. 590, 70 P. (2d) 308; Warvelle on Ejectment, \u00a7\u00a7 150 and 151.\nThe next contention made is based on the first theory of appellants\u2019 defense: That respondents, having in the past granted indulgences with respect to the time of payments of rent, could not claim a forfeiture without giving appellants a reasonable time after notice to pay the rent due on October 15th. In support of this contention, appellants cite a line of cases holding that a vendor, having waived strict compliance with an \u201cessence of time\u201d clause in the contract, cannot claim a forfeiture without giving the vendee a reasonable time to perform.\nThe principle of those cases is not applicable to an action in ejectment brought by a landlord against a tenant for default in payment of rent. Under Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 785, a demand for the payment of the rent in arrears was the only condition precedent to maintenance of the action. See Carlson v. Curran, 42 Wash. 647, 85 Pac. 627, 6 L. R. A. (N. S.) 260; Lewiston Water & Power Co. v. Brown, 42 Wash. 555, 85 Pac. 47; Warvelle on Ejectment, \u00a7 149 et seq.; 2 Tiffany, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 194, subd. f.\nAppellants\u2019 final contention rests upon the principle that, in an action for rent, a tenant may recoup on account of expenditures incurred in making repairs which the landlord covenanted to make. Tipton v. Roberts, 48 Wash. 391, 93 Pac. 906; Income Properties Inv. Corp. v. Trefethen, 155 Wash. 493, 284 Pac. 782. Respondents covenanted \u201cto repair and keep roof in good condition. Also agree to have a return system put on the heating plant.\u201d\nWhether respondents had performed these covenants was the principal issue in controversy and the one to which practically all of the evidence was directed. The trial court found:\n\u201c. . . that the plaintiffs placed a new roof on the building and have at all times kept the same in repair and in good condition, . . .\n\u201c. . . that the plaintiffs did put in a return system on the heating plant, and have complied with the terms of the lease in that respect.\u201d\nThe finding with respect to the roof is, to our minds, supported by an overwhelming preponderance of evidence.\nWhere the weight of the evidence rests with respect to the heating plant, is not so clear. That respondents made a good-faith attempt to carry out their covenant, there can be no doubt. In September, 1937, they spent approximately three hundred dollars to install what was represented to be a \u201creturn system.\u201d That it was not adequate, is admitted. In December of that year, respondents put in two hundred dollars more on a return system. Whether this installation was \u201ca return system,\u201d there is a contrariety of opinion among the experts\u2014some saying it was and some saying not. That the guests found trouble in keeping warm, there is no doubt. But again there is dispute as to whether their plight was due to inadequacy of the system or over-economy in firing.\nThe evidence is so evenly divided on these points that we are unable to say that it preponderates either way. Consequently we must accept the finding of the trial court on the issue. Columbus Varnish Co. v. Seattle Paint Co., 77 Wash. 245, 137 Pac. 434.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMillard, Main, Robinson, and Simpson, JJ., concur."

    "Mallery, J.\n\u2014 The plaintiff foreclosed a labor and material lien for thq plumbing installation in defendants\u2019 building. Defendants appeal from a judgment in the principal sum of $2,864.03.\nOn April 7, 1950, respondent started the plumbing job on the lower story and completed it April 19, 1950. About six weeks later, the plan of the building was changed and a second story added. Respondent commenced the plumbing installation on the second story in June and completed it in August, 1950. The parties hereto have always segregated the costs of the installations on the two stories.\nThe trial court found that the agreed price for the plumbing installation in the lower story was $1,339.17 plus tax. This is supported by the record notwithstanding appellants\u2019 contention to the contrary. However, a bill of particulars, required of the respondent, specified $1,166.01 as the cost of that part of the plumbing.\nSuch a bill of particulars, like the prayer of a complaint, is a limitation upon the possible recovery for the plumbing in the lower floor. Howells v. North American Transp. & Trading Co., 24 Wash. 689, 64 Pac. 786.\nAccordingly the judgment must be modified by reducing it $173.16, the difference between $1,339.17, the agreed price, and $1,166.01, as specified in the bill of particulars.\nThe trial court found that the reasonable value of the labor and materials on the upper story, on a quantum meruit basis, was $4,100.32 plus tax. Appellants attack this finding upon the ground that the market price of the labor and materials was not established. They rely upon the rule of 20 Am. Jur. 341, \u00a7 375, which reads:\n\u201cAs a general rule, proof of mere offers to buy or sell either land or personal property is not competent to show the value of such property or other property similarly situated in the vicinity. Market value is determined by actual sales, and not by the asking prices.\u201d (Italics ours.)\nIt may be that the plumbing material is personal property before its installation, but this is not an action for the purchase price of goods sold which have a market value. The plumbing installation in a particular building is not an article of commerce. . It has no established price in- any market.\nA number of exhibits were received in evidence, over the objection of counsel, under the trial court\u2019s ruling that they were records kept by respondent in the operation of his business in connection with the job here in question, and made prior to any controversy. Appellants do not renew their objection upon appeal to the competency of the exhibits; but, rather, take the position that they represent merely the respondent\u2019s asking price according to the rule set out above. Their position is untenable.\nA consummated sale, as here, obviated the asking price as such. In any event, the rule cannot apply where there is no ascertainable market price.\nAppellants contend that the lien for the lower story was not timely filed. We hold that both stories'of the building must be considered together for the purpose of computing the time for the filing of labor and material liens. Building Supplies v. Gillingham, 17 Wn. (2d) 489, 135 P. (2d) 832.\nThe judgment is affirmed as modified. Respondent is awarded his costs.\nGrady, C. J., Hamley, Finley, and Olson, JJ., concur.\nMarch 10, 1954.

    "Hill, C. J.\nThe issue presented is whether a tenant has made a prima facie case against his landlord in an action for personal injuries and property damage, occasioned by the breaking of a large store-front, plate glass window. The trial court granted a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, and entered an order of dismissal. The plaintiff appeals. We shall hereafter refer to the parties as the tenant and the landlord.\nThe tenant paid two hundred dollars to the agent of the landlord on November 26, 1955, as rent for the month of December, 1955. This was for additional store space, which -the tenant, a florist, needed for the Christmas season. He took possession immediately after paying the rent and before the 1st of December.\nThe dangerous condition of the window (the glass was detached from its frame at one of the top corners and left an opening of approximately three inches) was discovered by an employee of the tenant when he started to wash the window, and was reported to an agent of the landlord by the tenant.\nThere is likewise no dispute that an agent of the landlord, some time around December the 1st or 2nd, promised to have the condition repaired; whatever the date, it was after the lease was entered into, the rent paid, and possession taken.\nA glass company was requested by the landlord\u2019s agent to do whatever was required, -but on December the 6th, before anything was done, a strong wind blew the glass out with resulting damage to the property of the tenant and injury to his person, which occurred while he was endeavoring to minimize the property damage.\nThe tenant concedes that the general rule is that a landlord is not responsible for injuries to a tenant from defects which are actually known to the tenant. He urges, however, that he comes within certain exceptions to the general rule, and that he established a prima facie case (1) for breach of contract, and (2) in tort.\nWe do not agree with either contention, and conclude that the trial court was right in dismissing the action.\nThe plaintiff fails on his contract theory, because there was no covenant to keep in repair, and no evidence of any agreement to make the specific repairs involving the window prior to or at the time the lease was made. The discovery of the dangerous condition of the window did not occur until after the lease was made and the tenant had gone into possession. (This circumstance distinguishes Johnson v. Dye (1924), 131 Wash. 637, 230 Pac. 625, on which the tenant relies.)\nIt follows that there was no contractual obligation on the landlord to make the repairs; that the tenant took the premises as he found them, and there was no implied warranty by the landlord that they were safe or fit for the purpose for which they were rented. Miller v. Vance Lbr. Co. (1932), 167 Wash. 348, 9 P. (2d) 351. (In the case of Stoops v. Carlisle-Pennell Lbr. Co. (1923), 127 Wash. 82, 219 Pac. 876, also relied on by the tenant, this court declined to pass on the issue of whether such a gratuitous promise to make repairs could give rise to liability against the landlord, but we thereafter met that issue squarely in Miller v. Vance Lbr. Co., supra.)\nNor is this a case where a tenant threatens to terminate a lease unless certain repairs are made and remains in possession because of a promise to repair.\nThere is no evidence of any consideration for the landlord\u2019s promise to have the necessary repairs made to the window, and no liability attached by reason of his failure so to do. Miller v. Vance Lbr. Co., supra.\nAs indicated in the Miller case, the landlord is at liberty to repudiate, or to perform, such a promise. If he elected to perform it, then he would be liable for the manner of performance. Here, it is clear, we are concerned with a delay to perform a promise for which there was no consideration, and we are not concerned with any negligence or want of care in the manner of performance.\nThe plaintiff fails also on his tort theory.\nThere could be tort liability on the part of the landlord for a defect in the premises only if it was known, or should have been known, to the landlord, and not known to the tenant at the time the tenancy agreement was entered into. In Miller v. Vance Lbr. Co., supra, we quoted the following language from Mesher v. Osborne (1913), 75 Wash. 439, 447, 134 Pac. 1092, 48 L. R. A. (N.S.) 917,\n\u201cTo the general rule of the landlord\u2019s nonliability for injury from defects, there is. the well recognized exception that, even in the absence of warranty or express agreement by the landlord to repair, he is liable to the tenant or the tenant\u2019s guest as for a tort, where, with actual knowledge of obscure defects or dangers at the time of the letting, he lets the premises without disclosing such defects to a tenant who does not know, and by the exercise of reasonable care would not discover, them. The duty to disclose such latent defects and dangers when actually known to the landlord exists without regard to any covenant or lack of covenant to repair. But in the absence of such covenant, there is no duty of inspection on the landlord\u2019s part to discover latent and unknown defects.\u201d\nThere is no evidence in this case that the landlord had any knowledge that the window was in a dangerous condition until it was called to the attention of his agent by the tenant; and, as indicated in the foregoing quotation, in the absence of a covenant to repair there was no duty of inspection on the landlord\u2019s part to discover latent and unknown defects.\nThe plaintiff has endeavored to bring himself within the ambit of the cases which relieve a tenant, during a reasonable period of time for the making of repairs by the landlord, from the defense of assumption of risk. Assumption of risk by the tenant does not become an issue until a duty to repair on the part of the landlord is established. The trial court concluded, and we agree, that no such duty was established.\nThe judgment of dismissal is affirmed.\nDonworth, Weaver, Rosellini, and Foster, JJ., concur."

    "Langenbach, J.\n\u2014 Respondents, as contractor, sued to recover the unpaid balance on a contract and to recover costs for repairs which were requested by appellant. Appellant affirmatively counterclaimed for damages which allegedly resulted from respondents\u2019 failure to follow contract specifications, but admitted a balance was still due on the contract.\nThe trial court granted judgment for respondents as pleaded, and dismissed the counterclaim with prejudice. This appeal was perfected.\nRespondents contracted to construct an 18-inch trunk sewer and two syphon lines according to contract specifications. The trunk sewer was satisfactorily completed; this dispute concerned only the installation of the syphon lines.\nThe syphon lines consisted of two pipes, one 10 inches and the other 12 inches, inside diameter, to be laid beside each other in a single trench for a distance of 4,100 feet with a minimum of 6 inches between them, and with the maximum trench width (at pipe level) of 16 inches plus the outside diameter of the pipe. The 12-inch pipe was to be laid 7 feet from the edge of a road, under a drainage ditch, with a minimum 36-inch cover. The lines were to follow the grade of the road.\nThe contract required the respondents to perform trench excavation and backfill, furnish and install pipe, manholes, fittings and other appliances. The respondents used 13-foot sections of asbestos cement pressure pipe as the syphon lines.\nThe applicable pipe bedding method was prescribed as follows:\n10. Pipe Bedding\nPipe bedding shall be accomplished as shown in the Standard Detail. Where the material at the bottom of the trench is unstable, the matter shall be brought to the attention of the Engineer. The unstable material shall be removed to the extent directed by the Engineer and back-filled with foundation gravel, bedding gravel, and/or bedding concrete.\nBoulders, rocks, roots and other obstructions shall be entirely removed or cut out to the full width of the trench and to a depth 6\" below the pipe. The trench shall be backfilled and compacted to grade with select materials from the excavation or with bedding gravel.\nIn solid rock the trench shall be excavated 6\" below the pipe bottom and backfilled as provided above.\nThe bottom of the trench shall be finished with hand tools to provide uniform bearing along the barrel of the pipe and to provide suitable holes to fit the pipe bells.\nWhenever the trench is excavated below the depth required for proper bedding, it shall be backfilled with bedding gravel and compacted as required by the Engineer.\nThe evidence disclosed that, as the syphon line trench was being excavated, hardpan was encountered. The contract stated respondents had inspected the area and were satisfied as to the conditions of the site and contract specifications prior to submitting a bid. The contract specified that respondents handshape the trench bottom to fit the pipe barrel so that the pipe would rest on the shaped trench bottom. Respondents admitted this, but asserted that, when the hardpan was reached, it became impossible to hand-shape the bottom of the trench.\nThis hardpan condition was orally called to the attention of appellant\u2019s inspector, chief inspector, and project engineer, in an attempt to secure permission to use bedding material (pea gravel) in preparation of the trench bottom. Inspector Sims approved and reported favorably to his superiors, who refused this permission. Such requests were verbal, and none were in writing, as required by the contract:\n7. Corrections, Interpretations and Addenda\nAny omissions, discrepancies or need for interpretations should be brought to the attention of the Engineer in writing. The Engineer will issue written addenda to clarify questions which may arise. All interpretations or explanation of the Contract Documents shall be in writing in the form of an addendum and no oral statements by the Owner, Engineer or other representatives of the Owner shall in any way modify the Contract Documents whether made before or after letting the Contract.\n9. Omissions and Discrepancies:\nIf the Contractor, in the course of the work, finds any discrepancy between the drawings and the physical conditions of the locality, or any errors or omissions in drawings or in the layout as given by points and instructions, it shall be his duty to inform the Engineer immediately in writing, and the Engineer shall promptly verify the same. Any work done after such discovery, until authorized, will be done at the Contractor\u2019s risk.\nThe contract provision for payment of bedding material was:\nItem No. 15\nUnit price includes furnishing, placing and compacting bedding and foundation gravel and pit run gravel backfill material other than materials available from trenching. Payment will be made for only such material as is ordered by the Engineer. Bedding or foundation material required by unauthorized excavation below the required trench depth or for special bedding for Class 3 clay pipe shown on the plans will not be paid for.\nFurnish & Install Bedding Gravel 500 CY $4.50 $2250.00.\nWhen these oral requests for use of bedding material in the hardpan trench were refused, respondents determined that handshaping the trench bottom for suitable support of the trench barrel was impracticable in all instances and impossible in hardpan. Consequently, a cushion course method of installation was utilized. From the excavation, selected material (excluding rocks, roots and foreign material) was used for a cushion course of approximately 4 inches in depth. This was compacted by men walking on it. Thereon mounds would be placed; one where each end of the pipe was to be laid. Due to over-excavation, the mounds in some instances were 12 inches high; normally, the mounds were approximately 4 inches high. These mounds would not be compacted nor tamped prior to laying the pipes. After the pipes were laid, select material was used to fill the ditch up to the middle portion of the pipes; then, the dirt was compacted by two-by-fours, handles of shovels, and men using their feet. Due to the narrowness of the trench, this compacting was difficult.\nThe material used for mounding and filling was relatively dry. When the rains fell, the mound and fill material (the pipes being laid under a drainage ditch) became so saturated that it turned into a mush substance. Accordingly, the pipes were allowed to change position to such an extent that they broke. The engineers testified that the breaks were caused by \u201cbeam action.\u201d The plane of separation was nearly perpendicular to the center line of the pipe. This type of crack indicated that the top of the pipe had been in tension and the bottom in compression; the ends of the pipe sections deflected downward relative to the middle of the pipe. The number of the breaks totaled 48.\nAfter these breaks, appellant demanded that respondents make repairs and replace 1,000 feet of pipeline. Respondents made repairs but refused to replace the 1,000 feet of pipe; thereupon appellant retained another contractor. For this extra cost, appellant counterclaimed.\nAlthough appellant made several assignments of error, the critical one is finding of fact No. 4:\nThat following the execution of said Agreement aforesaid Plaintiffs entered upon the performance thereof on or about March 10, 1959, and proceeded to lay and install said 18\" trunk sewer and syphons in a good and workmanlike manner and would have completed said Contract work in its entirety on October 22, 1959, to which said date the time for performance was extended by Defendant, save for conditions and circumstances beyond their control in that due to the nature of the soil in which the syphon lines were to be laid, the fact that said trench for the syphon lines generally was underneath the drainage ditch for the roadway adjoining and that the design of said syphon line installation called for both the 10\" and 12\" 150 foot head asbestos cement pressure pipe 13 feet in length to be laid in the same trench at the same elevation with a minimum 6\" clearance between the two and with a maximum trench width at the top of the pipe as the outside diameter of the pipe barrel plus 16\" it was not possible by the exercise of good workmanship and without the use of bedding gravel, as requested by Plaintiff of Defendant and the use of which as a pay item under said Contract was refused by Defendant, to obtain compaction of the material selected from the excavation for the bedding for the pipe so as to provide uniform support or bearing for and along the barrel of the pipe, by reason of all of which when the fall rains came commencing in September of 1959 and the soil in the trench became saturated there occurred approximately 48 leaks in the said syphon lines by beam action which required repair. (Italics ours.)\nThe questions are whether this finding is supported by the evidence, and whether, in any event, respondents were relieved of their contract specifications.\nThe general principles and law are well-settled:\n[I]n 88 A.L.R. 798.\n\u201c . . . [A] construction contractor who has followed plans and/or specifications furnished by the contractee, his architect or engineer, and which have proved to be defective or insufficient, will not be responsible to the contractee for loss or damage which results \u2014 at least after the work is completed \u2014 solely from the defective or insufficient plans or specifications, in the absence of any negligence on the contractor\u2019s part, or any express warranty by him as to their being sufficient or free from defects.\u201d (Italics ours.) Kenney v. Abraham, 199 Wash. 167, 170, 90 P.2d 713 (1939).\nContractors have no right to depart from working plans made a part of the contract. If they do so, it is at their peril, and they become guarantors as to the strength and safety of the structures. The parties were clearly entitled to contract to have the buildings erected in accordance with certain plans and specifications. An express contract admits of no departure from its terms, and the subcontractors could discharge themselves from liability only by constructing the buildings in accordance with the plans and specifications, unless a deviation was mutually agreed upon.\nWhen defendant departed from this specification they did so at their peril, and all attempted excuses for noncompliance became immaterial. Robert G. Regan Co. v. Fiocchi, 44 Ill. App. 2d 336, 340, 194 N.E.2d 665 (1963). The general rule is that a builder must substantially perform his contract according to its terms, and in the absence of contract governing the matter, he will be excused only by acts of God, impossibility of performance . . . . If he wish to protect himself against the hazards of the soil, the weather, labor or other uncertain contingencies, he must do so by his contract. White v. Mitchell, 123 Wash. 630, 634, 213 Pac. 10 (1923).\nIn Maryland Cas. Co. v. Seattle, 9 Wn.2d 666, 676, 116 P.2d 280 (1941), the court noted that the contract in that case did not contain any representation or implied warranty as to underground conditions. It said:\nRather, we think, the present case comes within a familiar principle of contract law which is succinctly stated in the italicized portion of the following quotation from Judge Brand\u00e9is\u2019 opinion in United States v. Spearin, 248 U.S. 132, 136, 63 L. Ed. 166, 39 S. Ct. 59:\n\u201cWhere one agrees to do, for a fixed sum, a thing possible to be performed, he will not be excused or become entitled to additional compensation, because unforeseen difficulties are encountered [citing cases]. Thus one who undertakes to erect a structure upon a particular site, assumes ordinarily the risk of subsidence of the soil [citing cases]. But if the contractor is bound to build according to plans and specifications prepared by the owner, the contractor will not be responsible for the consequences of defects in the plans and specifications [citing cases].\u201d\nRespondents inspected the area prior to bidding and knew it to be of hardpan; yet, they did not contract for such a possibility. They assumed the risk of the difficulty encountered in handshaping to fit the barrel of the pipe into a hardpan trench. See, Restatement, Contracts \u00a7 456; and 6 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1333, p. 365 (1962). Nevertheless, respondents argued that, upon hitting hardpan, hand-shaping the trench bottom became so impracticable as to be impossible; that they went to appellant\u2019s inspector and engineer for permission to use bedding gravel, which was denied. Also, the consensus of all expert witnessed was that some bedding material (as pea gravel) was required for proper installation of these syphon lines, and that hand-shaping the trench was not an adequate method under the circumstances. Be that as it may, respondents agreed to follow the specifications provided by appellant; as long as they did so, they would not be liable for any disastrous consequences.\nEven assuming that it was physically impossible to hand-shape the trench bottom, respondents would only be discharged from nonperformance or poor workmanship (due to the impossibility) by following the specifications. The legal effect of impossibility would not relieve respondents from the onus of guaranteeing any method or plan of installation other than in the contract specification as that rule is stated in Kenney v. Abraham, supra.\nConfronted with the refusal of their oral requests to use bedding material in the trench, respondents had the following courses of procedure: (1) to obtain written permission to use bedding gravel when hardpan was encountered; or (2) to attempt to use bedding gravel as an extra. The only other alternative would have been to proceed as directed by the contract. Section 7 provided, \u201cneed for interpretations should be brought to the attention of the Engineer in writing. . . . All interpretations . . . shall be in writing.\u201d (Italics ours.) Section 9 provided, \u201cIf the Contractor, in the course of the work, finds any discrepancy between the drawings and the physical conditions of the locality ... it shall be his duty to inform the Engineer immediately in writing, and the Engineer shall promptly verify the same. Any work done after such discovery, until authorized, will be done at the Contractor\u2019s risk.\u201d (Italics ours.)\nInstead of proceeding by any of these methods, respondents ignored the contract in the presence of hardpan; the cushion course or mounding method was used. Alternatively, assuming the contract specifications did not require handshaping of the trench bottom, respondents adopted the cushion course or mounding method on their own initiative. In so doing, they assumed full responsibility for their course of action. Kenney v. Abraham, 199 Wash. 167, 90 P.2d 713 (1939).\nNevertheless, respondents argued that the inspectors and engineer, not only in charge of the project but also in interpreting the contract and in authorizing extras, knew that respondents were using the cushion course method (one inspector described the work as excellent) without any objection thereto. Therefore, appellant is precluded from now objecting. This court, however, in Hurley v. Kiona-Benton School Dist. No. 27, 124 Wash. 537, 215 Pac. 21 (1923), has answered this argument. It was held that the clause giving the architect or engineer final power to determine or interpret provisions of a contract does not confer power on the engineer to modify the contract and accept a different specification. Otherwise, there would be no need of the written contract. Accord, DeHoney v. Gjarde, 134 Wash. 647, 236 Pac. 290 (1925).\nRespondents further asserted the trial court\u2019s determination and judgment upon conflicting evidence is decisive and the appellate court cannot substitute its findings in lieu of those of the trial court. This court is bound by such findings if supported by substantial evidence. Delegan v. White, 59 Wn.2d 510, 368 P.2d 682 (1962).\nWe are of the considered opinion that the overwhelming evidence on both sides did not support that part of finding of fact No. 4 italicized above.. The respondents deliberately did not follow the specifications and contract in the installation of the syphon lines. The breaks were caused solely and entirely by the manner of their installation. This was the sole responsibility of the respondents, once they determined to ignore the express terms of the contract. This disregard caused the syphon lines to break and the respondents were responsible for such cause.\nThe judgment is reversed. The cause is remanded to enter a judgment for respondents in the sum of $19,761.08 which the appellant has admitted as the balance due on the original contract. The appellant is allowed its costs on appeal.\nHill, Finley, Ott, and Hamilton, JJ., concur.\nJudge Langenbach is serving as a judge pro tempore of the Supreme Court pursuant to Art. 4, \u00a7 2(a) (amendment 38), state constitution."

    "Schwellenbach, C. J.\nThis is an appeal from a judgment in favor of the. plaintiff in an action of unlawful detainer.\nThe respondent, Signal Oil Company, was lessee of certain premises in the city of Bremerton, Washington, a portion of which was a vacant lot. July 1, 1940, Signal Oil Company, as lessor, entered into a sublease agreement with Stebick, as sublessee, covering the vacant portion of the above-mentioned property. The sublease, which was to run until November, 1942, provided that, in the event the lessor exercised its option to renew its original lease with the owner of the property, then the lessor granted to Stebick, the sublessee, an extension of the sublease during the time the original lease was in effect with the owner. The extension was granted by the owner to Signal Oil Company in 1947 for a period of ten years.\nThe sublease to Stebick provided for a monthly rental of fifteen dollars payable in advance on or before the first day of the month during the continuance of the tenancy. It also provided:\n\u201cLessee agrees: ... to use the premises for no other purpose than to conduct an automobile sales business; to continuously operate said business; ...\u201d\nUpon the execution of the lease, Stebick constructed a frame building on the premises. It was of single construction without plaster and did not conform to the requirements of the Bremerton building code. The city building inspector talked to Stebick several times about plastering the building and making it fire-resistant. Stebick promised to do so, but never did. Later, he converted the building into a repair shop for automobiles, and the inspector \u201cvacated\u201d it. Subsequently, Stebick sublet the building to certain parties for use as an upholstering shop, and later to other parties for a cabinet shop. The building inspector \u201cvacated\u201d the building as to both operations because of violation of building codes. The premises had not been used for an automobile sales business, as provided in the lease, for three or four years prior to the trial.\nOctober 9, 1950, Signal prepared a notice to Stebick informing him that he had failed to perform the condition of the lease quoted above, and notifying and requiring him in the alternative, to perform such condition within ten days after service of the notice upon him, or to surrender the property. The notice was personally served on Stebick October 21st. The notice not having been complied with, the summons and complaint in this unlawful detainer action was signed October 31st. However, the complaint was not filed until January 8, 1951, and was not served on the defendant until January 12, 1951.\nDefendant, in his answer, after admitting and denying certain allegations in the complaint, set out four affirmative defenses and cross-complained to recover alleged overpayments of rent. At the trial, the court struck affirmative defenses Nos. 2 and 3.\nJudgment was entered canceling and terminating the lease, awarding possession to the plaintiff, and ordering that a writ of restitution be issued, and dismissing the cross-complaint with prejudice. Defendant has appealed.\nIn view of our disposition of the case, we find it necessary to discuss only the questions raised by appellant\u2019s first and third assignments of error, in that the court erred in finding that appellant\u2019s first affirmative defense was not proved; and that the court erred in not allowing appellant to recover for alleged excessive rentals paid over, as alleged in his cross-complaint.\nThe first affirmative defense alleged that the plaintiff waived a breach of the lease by the acceptance of rent prior and subsequent to the alleged breach.\nWe have no hesitancy in concluding that appellant breached the covenant in the lease in which he agreed that he would use the premises for no other purpose than to conduct an automobile sales business and to continuously operate said business. Our primary problem is to determine whether or not respondent waived such breach by the acceptance of rent after the grounds for forfeiture were established.\nIn Wilson v. Daniels, 31 Wn. (2d) 633, 198 P. (2d) 496, we said:\n\u201cIf the landlord accepts rent with full knowledge of a breach of the terms of a lease, he waives his right to declare a forfeiture for such breach. If, under the provisions of the lease, rent is paid in advance, the landlord is not prevented from declaring a forfeiture for a breach occurring subsequent to the payment of rent and during the term for which the rent is paid. The payment of rent merely gives- the tenant the right of possession of the premises during the term, but it does not, during that term, give him the right to violate other provisions of the lease. Although the acceptance of rent waives the right to declare a forfeiture for prior breaches, it does not operate as a waiver of a continuance of the breaches or of any subsequent breaches.\u201d\nIn that action, as in this, resort was had to the statutory remedy of unlawful detainer under the provisions of Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 812(4) [P.P.C. \u00a7 55-5]. (Note: We do not cite RCW 59.12.030(4) for the reason that its language is a departure from the language contained in Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 812(4).) We held that, under the statute, at the time the notice is served, the tenant must then be in violation of the provisions of the lease enumerated in the notice.\nAssuming, in the present case, that the rent was paid in advance October 1st, the tenant Stebick was thereby given the right of possession during the term for which'the rent was paid, or until November 1st. However, between October 1st and October 21st he had breached a condition of the lease. October 21st, he was served with a notice, in the alternative, to perform such condition or surrender the property. He did not do either. It then became necessary for the landlord, in order to obtain possession, to institute an unlawful detainer action by filing and serving on Stebick a summons and complaint. Although the complaint was signed October 31, 1950 (the date that the right of forfeiture arose), it was not filed until January 8, 1951, and both the summons and complaint were served on the defendant January 12, 1951. The action was therefore commenced January 12, 1951. Big Bend Land Co. v. Huston, 98 Wash. 640, 168 Pac. 470.\nIf, after giving notice in the alternative to either comply with the provisions of the lease or vacate the premises, the landlord accepted rent from the tenant, for rental periods subsequent to the breach, it thereby waived the breach relied upon in the notice of October 21, 1950, and a new notice would then become necessary. In Batley v. Dewalt, 56 Wash. 431, 105 Pac. 1029, in holding that the acceptance of rent from the assignee of the lease constituted a waiver of a covenant against assignment, we said:\n\u201cAs soon as they accepted rent in advance from the assignees, with full knowledge of all the facts, the right to declare a forfeiture was waived as fully and completely as by the written consent provided for in the lease itself. Such is the rule announced by this court, and the rule is amply supported by authority. [Citing cases.]\u201d\nThe question arose again in Field v. Copping, Agnew & Scales, 65 Wash. 359, 118 Pac. 329, where this court restated the rule:\n\u201cThe acceptance of rent eo nomine is ordinarily a recognition of the continuance of the tenancy, and where it is accepted after and with knowledge of the act of forfeiture by the tenant, it is a waiver of the forfeiture.\u201d\nSee, also, 16 R.C.L. 1132, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 653, etseq.; 32 Am. Jur. 749, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 883.\nThe rule with respect to a continuing breach is well stated in 51 C.J.S. 708, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 117 d. (2):\n\u201cWhere the cause of forfeiture is a continuing breach or the breach of a continuing covenant, such as the breach of a covenant as to the use of the premises, . . . \u2022 the waiver of one breach, as by the acceptance of rent accruing after the breach, does not destroy the breached condition or covenant, or waive subsequent breaches thereof, such waiver discharging only the particular breach.\u201d\nIn Wilson v. Daniels, supra, at page 644, we stated the effect of this rule when the action was brought under the unlawful detainer statute:\n\u201cHaving in mind that these statutes are strictly construed, and that they are designed to hasten the recovery of possession, we are of the opinion that, when the landlord accepts the rent, with knowledge of prior breaches, thereby waiving his right to declare a forfeiture of the lease because of such prior breaches, he also waives his right to rely on such prior breaches as a basis for setting in motion his statutory remedy of unlawful detainer. He must -wait until the old breaches continue or new ones occur.\u201d\nIt follows, therefore, that the waiver applies to the notice of forfeiture as well as to the breach.\nWe now turn to the factual question of whether respondent accepted rent under circumstances which amounted to a waiver under the foregoing authorities. The lease in question was arranged by F. W. Steinhart, of Bremerton, who is the agent-distributor for Signal Oil Company. In 1947, when the original lease from Tempio, the owner of the property, to Signal Oil Company was up for renewal, Steinhart told Stebick that he would have to pay him (Stein-hart) thirty dollars a month rental, rather than the original fifteen dollars, or the Tempio-Signal lease would not be renewed. To this Stebick agreed. From then on, Stebick paid Steinhart thirty dollars per month rent and Steinhart remitted fifteen dollars to Signal Oil. At times Stebick failed to make payments, and Steinhart, in the name of Kitsap Petroleum, sued him and recovered judgment. The company billed Stebick each month for fifteen dollars rent, and Steinhart remitted that sum each month to the company. The record shows the following testimony by Mr. Steinhart:\n\u201cA. Mr. Stebick, since he\u2019s been in there, I have had to pay his rent every month for the last ten or twelve years, and generally collect from him for Signal Oil\u2014I pay Signal Oil in cash and Mr. Stebick makes out checks for it. I, in turn, endorse them to Signal Oil by F. W. Steinhart and Kitsap Petroleum. Q. In other words, you are acting as agent for the Signal Oil Company? A. I am agent and distributor. Q. And you collect the rents for the benefit of the Signal Oil Company? A. No, I collect the rent for it and part of it is for me, since the check is for me and for Kitsap Petroleum and Signal Oil. Q. So you figure $15 for Stein-hart and pay $15 over as agent for Signal Oil. A. Yes.\u201d\nHe also testified:\n\u201cQ. Do they have a bill sent out directly by the office in Seattle? A. Everything goes through our Seattle office. Q. And that bill is sent to Mr. Stebick? A. Yes. Q. And do you know what rental is charged on those bills? A. $15 a month. Q. And you know the date upon which the last bill was sent? A. He is still sending them. I am still paying them. Q. You have paid them? A. Up to date. Q. Up to date? That is, today, the last rent date? A. First of the month. Q. First of the month? A. First of March.\u201d\nRespondent relies upon Steinhart\u2019s testimony that he pays Signal one hundred thirty-five dollars per month rent for the corner; that seventy-five dollars is paid by the service station; fifteen dollars is paid by Stebick, and that he (Stein-hart) absorbs the balance. Respondent contends that the fifteen dollars per month for Stebick is an obligation which Steinhart is compelled to pay to the company, and that it receives that money, not as a rental payment by Stebick, but as a part of Steinhart\u2019s obligation. This amounts to a contention that appellant has not been paying his rent under the lease. We ask this question: Could Signal Oil, as lessor, at any time since the lease was entered into, have commenced an action of unlawful detainer against Stebick, after having served notice on him to pay rent within three days or surrender the premises? We are satisfied that it could not have done so because the rent had been paid.\nRespondent leased the premises to appellant at a monthly rental of fifteen dollars. It billed Stebick for the rental the first of each month. It received and accepted through Stein-hart, its agent (who collected from Stebick for Signal Oil), the fifteen dollars monthly rental up to the time of trial. Having accepted the rent for November, December and January, when it commenced this action, it waived the breach of the terms of the lease relied upon in its notice of October 21st, and that notice, since it referred only to a breach which had been waived, became a nullity.\nIn his third assignment of error, with respect to his cross-complaint, appellant contends that the oral agreement between appellant and Steinhart, whereby appellant agreed to pay an additional fifteen dollars per month, was invalid as an oral modification of a written lease because it was not in writing, and that he should recover .back the additional amounts paid. The record clearly shows that the agreement to pay the additional fifteen dollars per month rent was solely between Steinhart and appellant, and that these additional payments were made to Steinhart for his benefit and not for the benefit of the Signal Oil Company. The company continued to bill appellant for fifteen dollars per month rental. Appellant had notice of this and knew, or should have known, that the company was not claiming or. collecting more than the amount agreed upon in the lease. This is an action by the Signal Oil Company, as lessor, against Stebick, as lessee, and Stebick cannot cross-complain against the company for any overpayments he may have made to Steinhart.\nThat part of the judgment dismissing the cross-complaint is affirmed, and that part canceling and terminating the lease and awarding possession to respondent is reversed. Appellant will recover costs of this appeal.\nGrady, Weaver, and Olson, JJ., concur."

    "Brachtenbach, J.\nThis suit concerns a 99-year ground lease. The main issue is the meaning of the rent payment clause. The trial court granted summary judgment to the landlord, held that the lease was not ambiguous, determined the meaning of the rental clause, and awarded back rent to the landlord based upon the trial court's interpretation of the rental clause. By unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed in the main but remanded for determination of certain facts which existed at the inception of the lease. We reverse the trial court, modify the Court of Appeals opinion, and remand for trial.\nThe ground lease, executed in 1959, terminates in 2058. The ground tenant, defendant, removed a residence from the property, as allowed by the lease agreement, and constructed a commercial building on the land. This commercial building was originally leased to Safeway Stores for 15 years. Upon Safeway's removal, the tenant converted the building to a small shopping center which was subleased to a number of tenants during the period at issue.\nIn August 1987, the landlord brought the present suit, contending that for several years the defendant incorrectly calculated the rent due the landlord under the ground lease.\nAs will be seen, the rent due the landlord under the ground lease is calculated with respect to what constitutes \"gross rentals\" from the subtenants and what may be deducted therefrom to ascertain \"net rentals.\" \"Net rentals\" is the amount to which a formula set out in the ground lease applies for division of income between the landlord and the tenant, the parties in this suit.\nThe lease contains the following provision:\n(3) Rental. The rental shall be Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($5,000.00) per year, payable in advance on or before the 19th day of October, 1959, of each year during the term of this lease. Receipt of Five Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($5,000.00) paid as rental for the first year of said term is hereby acknowledged.\nIt is expressly provided that on the first of the month in which the annual rent falls due, Lessee, prior to paying the annual rental of $5,000.00, each year during the term hereof, commencing with the fifteenth (15) year, shall refer to the then current United States Consumer Price Index (all items) as compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor (1947 - 1949 = 100). If such index reading at date hereof reflects an increase or decrease in the purchasing power of the United States Dollar equal to five percent (5%) or more, the minimum rent payment hereunder shall be proportionately increased or decreased to the end that rent payments are annually adjusted to maintain the same purchasing power they represented at date hereof, provided that the total increase or decrease above or below the original rental of $5,000.00 per year shall in no event exceed three percent (3%) multiplied by the number of years of said term which shall have expired. In the event the said Consumer Price Index is modified or replaced, the comparable effective cost of living index published by the United States Department of Labor or other Federal agency shall be employed using reasonable and accepted conversion factors as necessary.\nIn addition to the above mentioned rental, Lessee shall pay ten (10%) per cent of net rentals received after the third year of said term from tenants of any buildings constructed on said property. If Lessee uses or enters into any agreement for the use of said property or any portion thereof for parking or thoroughfare purposes for the benefit of any business conducted in a building or buildings on other property, a portion of any such building or buildings shall be assumed to be on the above described property for the purpose of computing rental hereto. Said portion shall be in the same proportion as the area of the above described property used for such purposes bears to the total area used for building, parking and thoroughfare purposes for the benefit of such business. Net rentals shall be defined as gross rentals from the actual tenants, less payments made for taxes and assessments, insurance on said premises, management fees not to exceed five (5%) per cent of gross rentals and real estate commissions not to exceed five (5%) per cent of the gross rentals for the first ten (10) years and two-and-a-half (2 1/2%) per cent of the gross rentals thereafter, and depreciation actually taken for income tax purposes.\nCommencing with the sixteenth (16) year after completion of the first building constructed on said property, the rental shall be as computed above, or it shall be fifty (50%) per cent of net rentals, whichever is greater.\nLessor shall have the right each year for a period of ten (10) consecutive working days selected by them to audit those books of Lessee pertaining to rentals received by Lessee from such tenants.\nClerk's Papers (July 5, 1988), at 8-9.\nPlaintiff-landlord moved for partial summary judgment, asking the court to declare that the same formula for calculating the percentage rent due the landlord applied throughout the term of the lease, that all receipts from subtenants be included in \"gross rentals,\" and that only those expenses listed as deductible in the formula are deductible in calculating rent due. The landlord relied solely on the written lease. The landlord's motion for partial summary judgment was filed before any responsive pleading was filed.\nThe trial court granted the motion for partial summary judgment, and held that the rental provisions are clear and unambiguous. Defendant then moved to vacate the order granting partial summary judgment or, alternatively, to modify that order to provide that any reimbursements from the subtenants be excluded from the definition of \"gross rentals\" unless the expenses for which the reimbursements were made can be deducted to determine \"net rentals.\" In support of the motion to vacate or modify, defendant submitted affidavits of intent and the circumstances surrounding the making of the lease.\nIn the meantime, the landlord filed a final summary judgment motion for a judgment against defendant for past rent due plus interest. The trial court denied defendant's motion and granted the second summary judgment motion. In denying defendant's motion, the trial court (different from the one which granted partial summary judgment) specifically found that \"the affidavits submitted by defendant in support of the motion to vacate are not subject to being considered, and, even if considered, do not alter or modify the clear and unambiguous language of Section 3 of the Lease.\" Clerk's Papers (July 5, 1988), at 129.\nDefendant-tenant appealed, contending that summary judgment was improperly granted. The tenant advanced two theories, either of which would raise factual issues: First, whether the lease is only a partially integrated contract, i.e., whether the writing is a final expression of those terms which it contains, but not a complete expression of all terms agreed upon, Emrich v. Connell, 105 Wn.2d 551, 716 P.2d 863 (1986); and second, whether the rental clause is ambiguous. Speaking generally, either situation would allow extrinsic evidence to prove omitted but not inconsistent terms, or to determine the intent of the parties.\nThe Court of Appeals reversed in part, and attempted to provide a definition of gross rentals by limiting it to payments of the exact same character as the tenant received from his original subtenants under the first subleases. The Court of Appeals added another condition, i.e., that even if the payments by subtenants are not of the same character as payments made by the original subtenants, they constitute gross rentals to the extent the tenant would be required to include them as gross income for tax purposes. The Court of Appeals based its definitions of gross rentals upon what it believed to be the intent of the drafter of the lease.\nThe Court of Appeals then remanded for resolution of factual questions regarding what expenses were paid by original subtenants and whether the amounts deducted by the tenant are of the same character as payments made by the original subtenants for maintenance, repairs, and improvements of the property.\nThe landlord sought review by this court.\nIn broad terms, the question posed is the interpretation of the subject lease. Inherent in resolution of that issue are the matters of integration, ambiguity, plain meaning and parol evidence.\nBefore examining the specific issues raised herein an overview of the problems of interpretation of contracts is necessary. We use the word \"interpretation\" in the sense described by Corbin and the Restatement and distinguish it from \"construction.\" Corbin states: \"Interpretation is the process whereby one person gives a meaning to the symbols of expression used by another person.\" 3 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 532, at 2 (1960). The Restatement definition is: \"Interpretation of a promise or agreement or a term thereof is the ascertainment of its meaning.\" Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 200 (1981).\nConstruction of a contract determines its legal effect. \"Construction . . . is a process by which legal consequences are made to follow from the terms of the contract and its more or less immediate context, and from a legal policy or policies that are applicable to the situation.\" Patterson, The Interpretation and Construction of Contracts, 64 Colum. L. Rev. 833, 835 (1964). See 3 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 534 (1960 & Supp. 1990).\nIt is deceptively simple to state the purpose of a court in interpreting a contract. \"The cardinal rule with which all interpretation begins is that its purpose is to ascertain the intention of the parties.\" Corbin, The Interpretation of Words and the Parol Evidence Rule, 50 Cornell L. Quar. 161, 162 (1965). 4 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 601, at 306 (3d ed. 1961). See Eurick v. Pemco Ins. Co., 108 Wn.2d 338, 340, 738 P.2d 251 (1987); In re Estates of Wahl, 99 Wn.2d 828, 830-31, 664 P.2d 1250 (1983); Dwelley v. Chesterfield, 88 Wn.2d 331, 335, 560 P.2d 353 (1977).\nAs would be expected, problems of contract interpretation have long been a source of judicial opinion. E.g., Smith v. Wilson, 3 B. & A. 728, 110 Eng. Rep. 266 (K.B. 1832) (where \"thousand\" was held to mean \"1,200\"); Raffles v. Wichelhaus, 2 H. & C. 906, 159 Eng. Rep. 375 (Ex. 1864). The subject has produced thousands of cases, numerous texts and countless commentaries. A study of these materials, including Washington cases, leads us to concur with the observation: \"[T]he rules produced by accumulated decisions as to how such discovery [of the parties' intention] shall be conducted often overlap and sometimes produce hindrance rather than help, while reconciliation of all cases is a task neither possible nor worth the effort . . .\". Nicoll v. Pittsvein Coal Co., 269 F. 968, 971 (2d Cir. 1920).\nIn approaching contract interpretation every court should heed the strong words of Corbin:\n[I]t can hardly be insisted on too often or too vigorously that language at its best is always a defective and uncertain instrument, that words do not define themselves, that terms and sentences in a contract, a deed, or a will do not apply themselves to external objects and performances, that the meaning of such terms and sentences consists of the ideas that they induce in the mind of some individual person who uses or hears or reads them, and that seldom in a litigated case do the words of a contract convey one identical meaning to the two contracting parties or to third persons.\n3 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 536, at 27-28 (1960). Holmes was more poetic: \"'A word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged; it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.'\" (Footnote omitted.) 4 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 609, at 402 (3d ed. 1961) (quoting Towne v. Eisner, 245 U.S. 418, 425, 62 L. Ed. 372, 38 S. Ct. 158 (1918)).\nA second major point applicable to contract interpretation is that the various principles of interpretation should not be applied as absolutes. They \"are to be taken as suggestive working rules only. . . . They will be harmful if they are taken as dogmatic directions that must be followed, or if they mislead us into thinking that language has only one meaning, the one absolutely correct.\" (Footnote omitted.) 3 A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 535, at 21 (1960).\nVarious efforts have been made to compile a set of rules of contract interpretation. E.g., Patterson, The Interpretation and Construction of Contracts, 64 Colum. L. Rev. 833, 852 (1964) (listing 10 \"standard maxims\" of contract interpretation); see Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 202 (1981) (listing rules in aid of interpretation). Each set of rules is subject to Corbin's caution. \"There is some doubt whether they [maxims of interpretation] have reliable guidance value for judges, or are merely justifications for decisions arrived at on other grounds, which may or may not be revealed in the opinion.\" Patterson, 64 Colum. L. Rev. at 852; see Green River Vly. Found., Inc. v. Foster, 78 Wn.2d 245, 252, 473 P.2d 844 (1970) (Finley, J., concurring); cf. Eurick v. Pemco Ins. Co., supra at 340-41 (\"rules of construction are not goals in themselves but only aids to interpretation\").\nWith the above observations in mind we turn to the central issue of contract interpretation in this case.\nThere remains to be discussed the interpretation issue which presents the greatest difficulty. If the disputed language is written, will the proponent of one meaning be permitted to aid his cause by verbal testimony? If so, what is the permissible range such testimony can take? On these important details the Washington cases are in confusion.\nThere are cases in which the court examined the circumstances surrounding the execution of a writing as an aid to its interpretation and sustained the admissibility of the pertinent evidence even though the writing might on its face be unambiguous. The position taken in these cases is the one endorsed by Professors Corbin and Williston and by the Restatement of Contracts. It is the only approach which can consistently yield interpretations likely to coincide with the meanings the parties contemplated.\nThere are other cases in which the court indicated that it will not look beyond the four corners of a contract writing unless what appears within those four corners is ambiguous. The reason is variously stated as an interpretation principle, or as an application of the parol evidence rule. Neither reason is persuasive.\n(Footnotes omitted.) Shattuck, Contracts in Washington, 1937-1957: Part II, 34 Wash. L. Rev. 345, 374-76 (1959). Professor Shattuck cites a number of cases as examples of the contrasting analyses. See Shattuck, 34 Wash. L. Rev. at 374 n.403, 376 n.406.\nDespite the accuracy of the conclusion that seldom will any word or phrase carry only a single meaning which is readily discernible by any reader, this court on occasion has embraced the \"plain meaning rule.\"\nThe Plain Meaning Rule states that if a writing, or the term in question, appears to be plain and unambiguous on its face, its meaning must be determined from the four corners of the instrument without resort to extrinsic evidence of any nature.\n(Footnote omitted.) J. Calamari & J. Perillo, Contracts \u00a7 3-10, at 166-67 (3d ed. 1987). In following this rule, this court has held that only if a contract is ambiguous on its face will the court look to evidence of the parties' intent as shown by the contract as a whole, its subject matter and objective, the circumstances of its making, the subsequent conduct of the parties, and the reasonableness of their interpretations. E.g., St. Yves v. Mid State Bank, 111 Wn.2d 374, 378, 757 P.2d 1384 (1988); Boeing Airplane Co. v. Firemen's Fund Indem. Co., 44 Wn.2d 488, 496, 268 P.2d 654, 45 A.L.R.2d 984 (1954); Bellingham Sec. Syndicate, Inc. v. Bellingham Coal Mines, Inc., 13 Wn.2d 370, 384, 125 P.2d 668 (1942).\nThe plain meaning rule has been criticized by leading commentators. See, e.g., 3 A. Corbin \u00a7 542; 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 2461-2462 (1981); 4 S. Williston \u00a7 629; 2 E. Farnsworth, Contracts \u00a7 7.12, at 277-78 (1990); J. Calamari & J. Perillo \u00a7 3-10. The rule has been rejected by the Uniform Commercial Code, U.C.C. \u00a7 2-202 comment 2, and the Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 2002-04 (1981).\nAs Professor Shattuck notes, however, even while sometimes following the plain meaning rule, this court has not consistently applied it. Instead, the court has also sometimes held that a trial court may, in interpreting contract language, consider the surrounding circumstances leading to execution of the agreement, including the subject matter of the contract as well as the subsequent conduct of the parties, not for the purpose of contradicting what is in the agreement, but for the purpose of determining the parties' intent. See, e.g., Stender v. Twin City Foods, Inc., 82 Wn.2d 250, 510 P.2d 221 (1973); In re Estate of Garrity, 22 Wn.2d 391, 156 P.2d 217 (1945); Leavenworth State Bank v. Cashmere Apple Co., 118 Wash. 356, 204 P. 5 (1922). As stated in Stender:\nDetermination of the intent of the contracting parties is to be accomplished by viewing the contract as a whole, the subject matter and objective of the contract, all the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract, the subsequent acts and conduct of the parties to the contract, and the reasonableness of respective interpretations advocated by the parties.\nStender, at 254. This analytic framework for interpreting written contract language has been called the \"context rule.\" Eagle Ins. Co. v. Albright, 3 Wn. App. 256, 474 P.2d 920 (1970). See Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. G.W. Thomas Drayage & Rigging Co., 69 Cal. 2d 33, 442 P.2d 641, 69 Cal. Rptr. 561, 40 A.L.R.3d 1373 (1968) for an excellent articulation of the rationale of the context principle. Other courts have allowed evidence of the circumstances of the making of a contract for the purpose of interpreting the contract. E.g., Darner Motor Sales, Inc. v. Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., 140 Ariz. 383, 682 P.2d 388 (1984); Admiral Builders Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. South River Landing, Inc., 66 Md. App. 124, 502 A.2d 1096 (1986); Keating v. Stadium Mgt. Corp., - Mass. App. Ct. -, 508 N.E.2d 121 (1987).\nThe instant case presents a clear opportunity for this court to resolve the long-standing confusion engendered by inconsistent holdings in this area.\nWe now hold that extrinsic evidence is admissible as to the entire circumstances under which the contract was made, as an aid in ascertaining the parties' intent. We adopt the Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 212, 214(c) (1981). Section 212 provides:\n(1) The interpretation of an integrated agreement is directed to the meaning of the terms of the writing or writings in the light of the circumstances, in accordance with the rules stated in this Chapter.\n(2) A question of interpretation of an integrated agreement is to be determined by the trier of fact if it depends on the credibility of extrinsic evidence or on a choice among reasonable inferences to be drawn from extrinsic evidence. Otherwise a question of interpretation of an integrated agreement is to be determined as a question of law.\nAs explained in comment b to this section:\nIt is sometimes said that extrinsic evidence cannot change the plain meaning of a writing, but meaning can almost never be plain except in a context. Accordingly, the rule stated in Subsection (1) is not limited to cases where it is determined that the language used is ambiguous. Any determination of meaning or ambiguity should only be made in the light of the relevant evidence of the situation and relations of the parties, the subject matter of the transaction, preliminary negotiations and statements made therein, usages of trade, and the course of dealing between the parties.\nThis court's line of ca"

    "Rosellini, J.\nOn September 20, 1957, the respondents entered into a written lease, prepared by the lessors, which contemplated that a building to be constructed by the respondents would be used as a hardware store, but did not expressly require it, and which provided for a flat minimum rental plus a percentage of the profits.\nOn October 31, 1960, the respondents consented to an assignment of the lease to the appellants Higgins, reserving their rights against the original lessee. Shortly thereafter, the appellant Western Farmers Association purchased the rights and succeeded to the liabilities of the original lessee.\nOn September 4, 1965, without any notification to the respondents, the appellants Higgins vacated the leased premises and moved their hardware business to another location, where they continued as hardware merchants.\nThe respondents asked for the keys to the vacated premises, and when the appellants Higgins were unable to locate all of them, the respondents told them that they would have the locks changed. This was done, and a key was left with the respondents\u2019 attorney for the use of the appellants.\nThe appellants Higgins paid the rent for the month of October 1965 but did not pay any rent thereafter. The respondents notified the appellant Western Farmers Association that they would hold that association liable for the rent. They also endeavored, without success, to find another tenant for the building.\nThis action for the unpaid rent and for reimbursement for repairs was commenced August 26, 1966. The Western Farmers Association cross-complained against the appellants Higgins, its assignees. The trial court gave judgment for the respondents against both appellants for the accrued basic rental and override and for the basic rental for the balance of the term, as well as for the amount of the alleged repairs. Western Farmers Association was given judgment over against the appellants Higgins.\nThe first contention on appeal is that the trial court erred in refusing to find that the appellants Higgins were constructively evicted when the respondents changed the locks on the doors.\nA constructive eviction occurs when there is an intentional or injurious interference by the landlord or those acting under his authority, which deprives the tenant of the means or the power of beneficial, \"enjoyment of the demised premises or any part thereof, or materially impairs such beneficial enjoyment. Coulos v. Desimone, 34 Wn.2d 87, 208 P.2d 105 (1949). Whether there has been such an eviction is, of course, generally a question of fact to be determined by the trier of the facts.\nThe only evidence which would tend to show a constructive eviction was the evidence that the respondents had the locks changed after the appellants Higgins had moved out of the leased premises. The respondent husband testified that he did so because there were outstanding keys which the appellants Higgins could not account for; also, that he figured that the appellants Higgins had abandoned the sublease and that the lease had reverted back to the Western Farmers Association. He testified further that he offered a key to an officer of the association, who said that he would rather that the key were left with the respondents\u2019 attorney.-\nWhile the appellant husband testified that he had intended to use the premises for the sale of certain items, he did not suggest that he had made this intention known to the respondents or ever asked for access to the building for any purpose, except on one occasion when he was showing fixtures to a prospective purchaser. On another occasion he gave permission to a group of citizens to use the store for an art show.\nThe evidence showed that the respondents were eager to have the building occupied, since that was the only way that they could obtain their override. There was no evidence of an intent to evict, or of any interference with the appellants\u2019 use of the premises, other than the slight inconvenience of requiring them to ask for a key. The trial court was justified in finding that there was no constructive eviction.\nIt is next claimed that the trial court erred in allowing the respondents the amount which they claimed as reimbursement for repairs. The argument is that the claim was not substantiated by documentary evidence. No authority is cited for the proposition that such evidence is necessary. The contention- not being well taken on- its face, we will not consider it. State v. Gregory, 73 Wn.2d 537, 439 P.2d 400 (1968).\nThe appellants claim that the respondents failed to mitigate their damages. Assuming that the appellants are correct that the respondents were required to do so under the circumstances, the contention is nevertheless without merit, as there is substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the respondents had endeavored to rent the premises to others. An honest and reasonable effort is all that is required. Exeter Co. v. Samuel Martin, Ltd., 5 Wn.2d 244, 105 P.2d 83 (1940).\nThe appellants maintain that the respondents unreasonably refused to rent the premises for any use other than as a hardware store, but the record does not show this to be the fact. The respondents were unwilling to rent it for use other than as a hardware store under the existing lease, but they were willing to negotiate a new lease if a tenant could be found.\nThere is one contention of the appellants which, though unsupported by citation of authority, has merit on its face. This is that the trial court erred in giving a judgment which in effect accelerated the due dates of the rent which had not accrued at the time of the judgment. Since the lease does not contain an acceleration clause, this was error. Bernard v. Triangle Music Co., 1 Wn.2d 41, 95 P.2d 43, 126 A.L.R. 558 (1939).\nThe best that the court could do for the respondents on the record before it was to give judgment for the accrued rent and declare that the lease was valid and subsisting. The court did decree that the appellants were entitled to possession for the balance of the term. It did not make any provision for the recovery of unaccrued override based on profits, but the respondents do not complain of that.\nSince the term of the lease has now expired, it would serve no useful purpose to require the respondents to bring another action for the balance of the rent which had not accrued at the time of the judgment. The cause is therefore remanded with directions to modify the judgment entered with a provision that interest shall be calculated on each installment of rent from the date that it became due. This assumes, of course, that the appellants were left in quiet possession throughout the remainder of the term. There has been no suggestion that there was any interference with that possession on the part of the respondents.\nIn all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.\nFinley, C. J., Weaver and McGovern, JJ., and Poyhonen, J. Pro Tem., concur."

    "Hicks, J.\nLessor, Washington Hydroculture, Inc., brought a damage action against lessee, Frank Payne, for the cost of rebuilding two leased fiberglass greenhouses destroyed by fire. Summary judgment on liability was granted against lessee based on a provision in the lease commonly called a maintenance and delivery clause. There is no issue of fault, as this is an action on the contract.\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court. Washington Hydroculture, Inc. v. Payne, 26 Wn. App. 40, 610 P.2d 967 (1980). We reverse.\nIn 1975, Frank Payne leased two hydroponic greenhouses located on lessor's property from Washington Hydroculture, Inc. These greenhouses were over 120 feet long and about 26 feet wide and appear to have been affixed to the ground by some sort of foundation. The lease contained a general, unqualified, maintenance and delivery clause as follows:\nDuring the term of this lease, lessee shall maintain said [greenhouses]; and, upon expiration of the term hereof surrender in as good a condition as it shall be when lessee takes possession thereof, except for ordinary wear and tear.\nThe lease was prepared by lessor and, according to lessee's affidavit on the motion for summary judgment, was \"not negotiated by the parties\" nor did the parties ever discuss \"prior to execution of the lease, the risk of loss caused by fire.\"\nThe trial court did not inquire into fault and lessor admits that fault was unalleged and not at issue. The trial court denied lessee's motion for summary judgment and granted lessor's. The trial on damages resulted in an award of $23,780.72 to lessor.\nThere was no clause in the lease requiring lessee to insure the premises, however, lessee did have insurance on the contents. The insurance proceeds paid to lessee on the contents are almost the same amount as the amount awarded to lessor by the trial court.\nThe issue in this case is whether we should retain the rule requiring a tenant, regardless of fault, to rebuild leased premises destroyed by fire, where the tenant has entered into a lease containing a general maintenance and delivery clause with no exceptions other than normal wear and tear.\nPetitioner/lessee asserts that the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case conflicts with our decisional law, specifically with Anderson v. Ferguson, 17 Wn.2d 262, 135 P.2d 302 (1943) and United Mut. Sav. Bank v. Riebli, 55 Wn.2d 816, 350 P.2d 651 (1960). Respondent/lessor asserts that the decision of the trial court and the Court of Appeals in this case is in accord with the common law rule, still effective in this and some other jurisdictions. Respondent/ lessor also relies primarily on Anderson for its position. This confusion can be attributed to a harsh and outdated rule, the effects of which we have in the past attempted to avoid by reasoning around rather than changing.\nThere can be no dispute that the common law rule, and our early rule, was as stated by the Court of Appeals at page 42 in its opinion on this case:\nThus, it appears to be the settled law in this state that an unconditional or unqualified covenant on the part of the lessee to maintain and keep premises leased by him in good repair or in as good condition as that existing at the time specified in the lease, and to return the premises at the expiration or termination of the lease in such equivalent condition, obligates the lessee to rebuild in case the buildings leased are destroyed by fire or other casualty during the term.\nQuoting from Anderson v. Ferguson, supra at 270-71.\nOne of the earliest cases to apply the rule in Washington was Armstrong v. Maybee, 17 Wash. 24, 48 P. 737 (1897), where plaintiff/lessor brought action against a lessee for breach of a covenant in a lease covering a shingle mill, house, office, machinery, and office fixtures, all destroyed by fire during the course of the lease. The covenant in that lease was worded as follows:\nlessee shall maintain all of the machinery and buildings ... in as good condition and repair as the same now are in and return the same ... in as good condition as the same Eire now in, reasonable wear and tear from ordinary use alone excepted.\"\n17 Wash, at 25.\nThe use of the word \"alone\" in the Armstrong lease favors the construction placed on it by the court, holding the lessee liable to rebuild. The Armstrong court's analysis of authorities and decisionEil law indicates that the slightest variation in wording can make the difference between the loss falling on the lessor or the lessee. The court intends to uphold the intent of the parties, as was stated in Armstrong (quoting from a Michigan opinion):\n\"In construing the covenants in a lease the cardinal rule is that the intention of the parties shall govern; and the courts will not extend or enlarge the obligation of the lessee beyond the plain meaning of the language used and the intention existing at the time it was made; and if there is not an express stipulation to the effect to restore buildings and other property leased, destroyed by casualties from fire or water, without fault or neglect on the psirt of the tenant, the loss must fall upon the landlord\n17 Wash, at 28-29.\nThe court went on to hold against lessee, stating that in the case at bar we are unable, from any fair reading of the whole lease, to find any doubtful language or anything in the circumstances of the parties which would require other than one construction of the language used.\n17 Wash, at 29.\nIn Anderson v. Ferguson, 17 Wn.2d 262, 135 P.2d 302 (1943), we approved the rule but avoided applying it, stating that the phraseology of the covenant to repair and deliver in that case, as compared to the language used in the particular lease under consideration in Armstrong, was different. The language of the covenant was as follows:\n\"The said lessee . . . agrees to quit and deliver up the premises ... at the end of the term, in as good order, condition and repair as the reasonable use and wear thereof will permit. ...\"\n17 Wn.2d at 264. The court found the above language did not require by its terms that the lessee maintain or keep the premises in any particular condition whatever during the course of the lease. Also, the premises did not have to be delivered in as good condition as they were in the beginning of the lease but only in as good condition as reasonable use and wear would permit. And the language did not designate a certain point in time for referencing the condition of the premises. \"In any event,\" the court opined, \"the common-law rule is so harsh that it ought not to be applied unless the language of the lease clearly requires it.\" 17 Wn.2d at 273.\nIn United Mut. Sav. Bank v. Riebli, 55 Wn.2d 816, 350 P.2d 651 (1960), the rule once again was retained, but avoided on the phraseology, and by denominating the cause of the damage a \"latent defect\". In that case a water pipe ruptured damaging personal property of the lessee, lessor, and third persons. The latter sued both the lessee and lessor, and despite the fact that the lease contained both a maintenance and delivery clause, and a hold harmless clause, the court was able to avoid application of this harsh rule. The lease provided that the lessee had the duty to keep the premises in good repair, and to quit and surrender the premises \"in good order and condition, reasonable wear and damage by the elements excepted. ...\u201d 55 Wn.2d at 822. The hold harmless clause was clear:\n\"... The Lessee shall keep, save and hold harmless the Lessor from any and all damages and liability for anything and everything whatsoever arising from, or out of the occupancy by, or under, the Lessee, . . . and . . . from any fault or negligence by the Lessee, or any failure on the Lessee's part ... or otherwise, or whether it be caused by, . . . the failure of the Lessee ...11\n(Italics ours.) 55 Wn.2d at 822. The court held that neither the repair and delivery clause nor the hold harmless clause made the lessee insurer for a latent defect on the premises.\nAlthough the general rule at common law was to construe a general repair and delivery clause as requiring a tenant to rebuild, the jurisdictions are split on the issue. See 51C C.J.S. Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 368(7) and \u00a7 412 (1968). It is a much criticized rule, most often on the basis that \"repair\" or \"maintain\" does not mean \"rebuild\". See Stoebuck, The Law Between Landlord and Tenant in Washington, 49 Wash. L. Rev. 291, 361-63, 1090 (1974); Decker, Duties of a Tenant To Rebuild After He Has Covenanted To Repair, 6 Iowa B. Rev. 52 (1940). Other jurisdictions have altered the common law rule on this basis. See cases and text in 1 M. Friedman, Leases, \"Damage and Destruction of Leased Property,\" \u00a7 9.1 (1974):\nSome courts refused to follow the common law rule, and held that a covenant by the tenant to repair did not require the tenant to restore after a nonnegligent fire, this on the ground that one could \"repair\" only something in existence and that a covenant to repair could not require the creation of something new. This distinction between \"repair\" and \"restore\" rescued some tenants who had naively agreed to repair, with no suspicion of what the common law attributed to this covenant. However, a repair is a partial restoration and these terms do not necessarily present a clear contrast. Their difference may be of degree rather than of nature.\n(Footnotes containing citations omitted.) Friedman, Leases, supra at 313.\nThe wording in the covenant in the instant case is not as clear as the wording in Armstrong, and although it does not necessarily fall into the exceptions to the rule that were carved out in previous cases, we do not construe this provision as automatically imposing the duty to rebuild on lessee. The language seems to us to describe a duty to maintain as opposed to an obligation to rebuild. It is time that we abandon a rule imposing liability absent fault based on \"magic\" language, the import of which laymen, or indeed lawyers themselves, may not perceive. As we said in Armstrong, what controls in a lease is the intent of the parties at the time of its execution, and the plain meaning of the language used. Where lessor drafts the lease, ambiguities must be resolved in favor of lessee. Armstrong v. Maybee, supra; Puget Inv. Co. v. Wenck, 36 Wn.2d 817, 221 P.2d 459, 20 A.L.R.2d 1320 (1950). We will not extend the obligation of lessee beyond the plain meaning of the language used, and if there is not an express stipulation requiring lessee to rebuild properties destroyed without fault, the loss will fall on the landlord.\nThe plain meaning of maintain or repair is not synonymous with rebuild. \"Repair\" means \"to amend, not to make a new thing\", stated the Nebraska Supreme Court when abolishing the common law rule in that state in Wattles v. South Omaha Ice & Coal Co., 50 Neb. 251, 69 N.W. 785 (1897). The Supreme Court of California made the same distinction in holding that a covenant to repair did not include the complete rebuilding after destruction by fire through no fault of lessee. Realty & Rebuilding Co. v. Rea, 184 Cal. 565, 194 P. 1024 (1920).\nLessee alleged by affidavit that lessor had advised him that the building was fireproof and that he was wasting his money to insure the contents. There is no insurance provision in the lease requiring lessee to insure the buildings; were there it would indicate an intent by both parties to place liability on lessee. Lessee's affidavit also states that the cause of the fire was defective wiring that he in no way altered during his tenancy.\nWithout inquiry into fault on the part of lessee or intent at the time of execution of the lease, and without language expressly holding lessee responsible for rebuilding premises destroyed through no fault of his own, we cannot sustain the trial court. It defies reason and logic to hold lessee to a covenant containing words of art and magic language which lessor says we should construe as an \"express covenant\" to insure against acts of God and other casualties beyond the control of lessee. It is not express. \"Maintain\" does not mean \"rebuild\". One could agree to surrender premises in as good condition as when possession was taken in conjunction with a clause to maintain, and never contemplate their total destruction requiring rebuilding.\nWe hold that summary judgment is improper where, as here, intent is unclear. The case is remanded for trial in accordance with this opinion.\nBrachtenbach, C.J., and Rosellini, Utter, Dolliver, Williams, and Dimmick, JJ., concur.\nStafford and Dore, JJ., concur in the result."

Such liens for rent shall be paramount to, and have preference over, all other liens except liens for taxes, general and special liens of labor, and liens of mortgages duly recorded prior to the tenancy. Such liens shall not be for more than two months\u2019 rent due or to become due, nor for any rent or any installment thereof which has been due for more than two months at the time of the commencement of an action to foreclose such liens; no writing or recording shall be necessary to create such lien; and if such property be removed from the rented premises and not returned to the owner, agent, executor, administrator, or assign, said lien shall continue and be a superior lien on the property so removed for ten days from the date of its removal, and said lien may be enforced against the property wherever found. In the event the property contained in the rented premises be destroyed by fire or other elements, the lien shall extend to any money that may be received by the tenant as indemnity for the destruction of said property, nor shall the lien be lost by the sale of the said property, except merchandise sold in the usual course of trade or to purchasers without notice of the tenancy. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to, nor shall it be enforced against, the property of tenants in dwelling houses or apartments or any other place that is used exclusively as a home or residence of the tenant and his family.\nThe appellant contended in the trial court and in this court that the legislature, in enacting RCW 60.72.010, did not intend to give a landlord a lien upon the property of a third party held by the tenant under a lease. In support of this theory, the appellant urges that any other construction of the statute would render it unconstitutional. To take the property of one person, the appellant maintains, and use it to pay the debt of another, a debt to which the owner is not a party either legally or equitably, is to deprive him of his property without due process of law.\nIt should be noted at the outset that there is no contention in this case that the respondent landlord relied upon the tenant\u2019s ownership of the office furniture and equipment when he leased the office space. The space was rented before the equipment was rented. The statute, in providing for the lien, does not impose any requirement that there must have been such reliance. The lien attaches to the property designated in the statute, regardless of when it was acquired.\nInsofar as our research discloses, we have never directly held that this statute gives the landlord a lien on property of third persons. The question has been touched upon, but we have not heretofore been forced to resolve it.\nSee Kohout v. Brooks, 185 Wash. 4, 52 P.2d 905 (1935) and Carpenter v. Lent, 185 Wash. 458, 56 P.2d 157 (1935). See also Harrison v. National Cash Register Co., 196 Wash. 83, 82 P.2d 136 (1938) and Schneider v. Harold H. Schultz, Inc., 188 Wash. 56, 61 P.2d 990 (1936), where we dealt with the question of lien priorities as between landlord and conditional vendor.\nBearing in mind that an act should be given a construction that will render it constitutional, if reasonably possible, we turn first to the statute to ascertain, if we can, the legislative intent with respect to property of third persons in possession of the tenant under a lease agreement.\nIt is the position of the respondent, concurred in by the trial court, that the statute is clear and unambiguous, that it lists certain exceptions (which do not include leased property of third persons) and that, therefore, applying the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, leased property is subject to the lien.\nWe do not find the statute quite so free from ambiguity. It will be seen that\nproperty of third persons delivered to or left with the tenant for storage, repair, manufacture, or sale, or under conditional bills of sale duly filed, and such property as is exempt from execution by law\nis not subject to the lien. What is meant by the phrase, \u201csuch property as is exempt from execution by law?\u201d In the context, the expression is not free of ambiguity.\nStatutes giving a landlord a lien upon personal property of the tenant create a right which was not recognized at common law, and they are to be strictly construed against the landlord. United Cigar Stores Co. of America v. Florence Shop, 171 Wash. 267, 17 P.2d 871 (1933); Sixpine Leaseholders, Inc. v. Seattle Recreation Co., 171 Wash. 139, 18 P.2d 12 (1933).\nThe phrase, \u201csuch property as is exempt from execution by law,\u201d could have reference to those exemptions enumerated in RCW 6.12.090 and RCW 6.16, but inasmuch as these relate to homesteads and personal exemptions, only a few of them conceivably could be subject to the landlord\u2019s lien in any event. Most of the exempt items are of the kind which ordinarily would be kept in the owner\u2019s dwelling and RCW 60.72.010 expressly provides that it shall not apply to or be enforced against property of tenants in dwelling houses or apartments or any other place that is used exclusively as a home or residence of the tenant and his family.\nThe phrase in question is equally capable of being understood as expressing a legislative intent that the landlord\u2019s lien should not attach to property which is not subject to execution. If it is read this way, it exempts the lessor\u2019s interest in any leased property in the possession of the tenant, for such an interest is not subject to execution under the execution statute, that statute authorizing such execution only upon property of the judgment debtor. See RCW 6.04.020 and 6.04.120.\nThere is other language in RCW 60.72.010 which leads to the conclusion that the legislature did not intend the landlord\u2019s lien to attach to any property belonging to third persons, except where the interest of such persons is required to be recorded in order to be protected from liens. There is the phrase which reads as follows:\nand if such property be removed from the rented premises and not returned to the owner, agent, executor, administrator, or assign, said lien shall continue . . . for ten days . . .\nHere again is an indication that the legislature understood that it was providing a lien on property owned by the tenant or his principal. It would seem likely that, if the legislature intended the lien to attach to leased personalty, it would have added the word \u201clessee\u201d to this list of persons in whose hands the lien would not be lost.\nThere is yet another provision in this section which shows a legislative intent to provide for a lien only upon property of the tenant or property which he is deemed in law to own. This is the provision relating to fire insurance, which extends the lien only to money which may be received by the tenant as indemnity for the destruction of \u201csaid property.\u201d Thus, if the leased equipment and furniture should be destroyed by fire, the respondent would not be entitled to any of the proceeds of the insurance, inasmuch as the tenant, being in default on his personal property lease, would presumably have no interest in the property. It would seem that if the legislature had intended to make leased personal property subject to the lien, it would, in order to protect that lien, have given the landlord a lien upon the owner\u2019s interest in the proceeds of insurance upon leased personal property upon the premises.\nThus it is apparent that the legislature, in enacting this statute, was thinking primarily of granting a lien upon property of the tenant. The express exclusions manifest this intent. There is no expression of an intent to include property of third persons, other than property held under conditional sale contract; and even in that case, the owner can protect himself by filing his contract according to statute.\nFurther light is thrown upon the legislative attitude regarding the granting of lien rights if we examine other lien statutes.\nWe have searched those statutes and find that in every instance, with one possible exception \u2014 and that one ambiguous \u2014 the legislature has made the lien attach only to the property of the debtor. See RCW 60.04.020 (mechanics\u2019 and materialmen\u2019s liens); RCW 60.04.150 (protecting supplier of materials for work on the property upon which a lien is claimed); RCW 60.08.010 (lien for construction or repair of chattel at the request of the owner); RCW 60.12.010 (laborer\u2019s lien on crops for work done at request of owner or tenant \u2014 here the interest of the lessor of the land is expressly exempted from the lien); RCW 60.16.010 (work on orchards); RCW 60.20.010 (furnishing nursery stock); also 60.24.020; 60.24.030; 60.32.010; 60.34.010; 60.36.010; 60.40.010; 60.44.010; 60.48.010; 60.52.010; 60.56.010; 60.56.030; 60.60.010; 60.64.010 and 60.66.020.\nThe last two cited sections pertain to liens of hotel keepers, and they are perhaps open to more than one interpretation. RCW 60.64.010 gives a lien upon property of hotel guests lawfully brought upon the premises by them. Provision is made for the sale of such property. A proviso directs, however, that if the property does not belong to the guest and the hotel keeper has actual notice of that fact before sale of the property, the property shall not be subject to sale as provided therein, but\nmay be sold in the manner provided by law for the sale of property under a writ of execution to satisfy a judgment obtained in any action brought to recover the said charges or indebtedness.\nIt would appear that the legislature intended the hotel keeper\u2019s lien to attach only to the interest of the guest in property of third persons, since the execution statutes do not authorize the sale of property other than that of the judgment debtor. See RCW 6.04.060 and 6.04.120. Under the latter statute, where joint personalty is levied upon, the interest of the defendant can be sold. RCW 6.20.010 provides a procedure whereby a third party may assert his claim to property levied upon.\nRCW 60.66.010, the unrepealed 1890 act creating a hotel keeper\u2019s lien, refers only to the property \u201cof their guests.\u201d\nIn view of the consistent legislative pattern of authorizing liens only upon the property of the debtor or affording a third party whose property might become subject to a lien a means of protecting his interest, it is difficult to believe that the legislature intended to give the lessor of real property a right which it had accorded to no other creditor, when it enacted RCW 60.72.010.\nUnder RCW 60.72.010, a conditional vendor is given a means of protecting his interest \u2014 he can file his contract according to the statutory provisions and maintain the superiority of his lien. But a lessor is afforded no such protection. We are unable to discover any statute which provides for the filing of a lease as a means of protecting the interest of the lessor. The Uniform Commercial Code requires the filing of ostensible leases which are in fact taken as security interests \u2014 leases which give the lessee the option to purchase. See RCW 62A.1-201(37). The leases involved in this action are admittedly bona fide leases which require the return of the leased property at the expiration of the leasehold term. It has not been suggested that they are in reality conditional sales disguised as leases. Since the legislature has not seen fit to require the filing of leases (unless they are in fact security devices) in order to protect the interest of the lessor, it has at least impliedly recognized that the lessor\u2019s interest is not subject to claims of creditors of the lessee.\nOther evidence of legislative recognition of the validity of leases of personal property is found in the taxing statutes. Under RCW 82.04.040, the renting or leasing of personal property is defined as a sale for purposes of the tax, and RCW 82.12.020 imposes a use tax upon certain rented or leased personal property.\nWe cannot assume that the legislature intentionally has imposed tax burdens upon the transaction of leasing personal property, given it recognition as a legitimate business transaction and at the same time seen fit to penalize such leases in a way in which it has penalized no other transaction by imposing a discriminatory lien upon personal property which is leased in favor of one to whom the lessor is not indebted, without giving the owner of that property a statutory means of protecting his interest. It would seem that if the legislature contemplated that the interest of a lessor might become subject to the lien, it would have provided at least the statutory procedure for giving notice which is available to the conditional vendor.\n\u25a0 The respondent has not suggested any state of facts which would justify the legislature in giving preference to a lessor of realty over a lessor of personalty. Inasmuch as the legislature has enacted many lien laws and has not found it necessary to make these liens attach to the property of persons who are not parties to the transaction giving rise to the lien, the interpretation of this act should be approached with no presumption that such a result was intended here. Reading the provision as a whole, we do not find expressed therein any intent that the lien should attach to the lessor\u2019s interest in leased personalty kept on the premises by the tenant.\nIn State v. Lawton, 25 Wn.2d 750, 764, 172 P.2d 465 (1946), this court held that machinery leased to an employer who was indebted to the state for contributions to the unemployment compensation fund and used in the operation of his business, was not subject to a lien in favor of the state for these contributions. The statute which imposed the lien in that case expressly provided that the lien should exist not only against the interest of the employer but against the interest of all others, in the plant works, equipment and buildings, and buildings improved, operated or constructed by the employer. We held the act unconstitutional, in that it deprived the lessor of his property without due process of law. We said of the law:\nIt in effect requires a third party to pay the tax of a liable employer, without any provision for reimbursement.\nIf the legislature may not grant to the state a lien for taxes upon the property of one not liable for the tax, a fortiori, it cannot grant to a private individual a right to satisfy his claim out of the property of one who owes him nothing and who is afforded no statutory means of protecting his property from the lien.\nWe have adhered to the very wholesome principle that where an act is open to two constructions, under one of which the act will be valid and under the other invalid, that construction will be adopted which will render the act constitutional. State v. Twitchell, 61 Wn.2d 403, 378 P.2d 444 (1963); Yelle v. Bishop, 55 Wn.2d 286, 347 P.2d 1081 (1959).\nWe do not overlook the fact that the statute, in excluding property of third persons from the operation of the lien, mentions only five situations in which the property may be kept or used on the premises without becoming subject to the lien. At first glance, the rule expressio unius est exclusio alterius would thus seem to exclude any legislative intent to exempt property of third persons held under any other circumstances. But that rule, like all other rules of statutory construction, is to be used only as a means of ascertaining the legislative intent. DeGrief v. Seattle, 50 Wn.2d 1, 297 P.2d 940 (1956). The strongly manifested intent, expressed elsewhere in the section, to make the lien attach only to property in which the tenant or his principal has an interest, added to the presumption that the legislature intended to enact a law that is constitutional, overcomes the impact of this rule.\nWe conclude that RCW 60.72.010 does not create a lien in favor of lessors of real property upon property of others used or kept upon the leased premises under a valid and bona fide lease.\nThe judgment is reversed.\nFinley, Hunter, Hamilton, Utter, and Brachtenbach, JJ., concur."

    "Blake, C. J.\nMarch 11, 1933, plaintiff leased a storeroom to Samuel Martin, Ltd., for a term of five years commencing May 1, 1933, and ending April 30, 1938. The lease contained the following stipulation:\n\u201cIf default shall be made in the payment of any installment of rent according to the provisions of this lease, or if default shall be made in the keeping of any other covenant or covenants herein contained to be kept and performed by Lessee, then and in such event it shall be lawful for Lessor, at its election, to declare said term ended and Lessor may re-enter the demised premises or any part thereof with or without process of law and may expel and remove therefrom Lessee and every other person or persons occupying or being upon the same, using such force as may be necessary in so doing, and shall repossess and enjoy said premises again as of Lessor\u2019s first and former estate. Notwithstanding any re-entry by Lessor occasioned by any breach of the terms hereof by Lessee, the liability of Lessee for all unpaid rent provided for herein shall not be extinguished for the balance of the term of this lease and Lessee covenants and. agrees to make good to Lessor any deficiency arising from a re-entry or reletting of the premises at a lesser rental than herein agreed to, . . . \u201d\nJune 30, 1937, Martin vacated the premises, and on July 2nd following, plaintiff took possession. Rent for the months from January to June, 1937, inclusive, had not been paid.\nPlaintiff brought this action to recover the rent for those months and also the stipulated rent for the balance of the term. Answering, the defendants set up two affirmative defenses: (1) Constructive eviction; (2) surrender pursuant to agreement had with D. H. Yates, secretary and property manager of plaintiff. By way of counterclaim, defendants asked for damages flowing from the eviction and interference with their occupancy during the month of January, 1937.\nAt the close of defendants\u2019 case, plaintiff moved that they be required to elect between their defenses of constructive eviction and surrender by agreement. The court granted the motion, and defendants elected to stand on the agreement to surrender. A verdict was returned in favor of defendants for $1,181.83. The court denied a motion for new trial on condition that defendants agree to accept judgment in the sum of $575.53. Defendants having accepted the condition, judgment was entered in their favor in that amount. Plaintiff appeals.\nFrom what we have said, it is apparent that the issue is whether appellant repossessed the property-under the above quoted clause of the lease after abandonment and default by respondents or under an agreement for surrender entered into between, respondents and Yates. Upon this issue, the evidence is in sharp conflict.\nFrom respondents\u2019 version of the evidence, it appears that, on January 4,1937, appellant, without their consent, tore out the front of the store for the purpose of modernizing it and the entrance to the building. The work was not completed until January 27th. In the meantime, ingress and egress were so obstructed and the show windows were so obscured that the premises had the appearance of being unoccupied. Respondents had advertised a sale to be held during the period in which the structural changes were made. On January 29th, respondents wrote appellant as follows: \u201cDue to your interference with the entrance to our store, we are cancelling our lease as of this date.\u201d Respondents, however, remained in possession. March 10th, they presented to appellant a claim of damages for $2,060.04. As an outgrowth of the negotiations which followed, respondents testified that an agreement for surrender of the lease was entered into with Yates. Briefly, according to respondents, the terms agreed on were that respondents might remain in possession until June 30th, and that rent accruing from January 1st until that time should be offset against the damages sustained by respondents because of the interference with the occupancy occasioned by the construction work.\nAppellant does not question that respondents\u2019 evidence was sufficient to take the case to the jury upon the fact of the making of such agreement by Yates. It does question the sufficiency of the evidence to show authority in Yates to make any such agreement.\nIt is conceded that no express authority is shown. But respondents contend that there was sufficient evidence of apparent authority to make the issue one for the jury. Appellant contends that a rental agent .has no implied authority to make or cancel leases. This may be conceded. But Yates was much more than a .mere rental agent of appellant. He was its secretary. As such, he executed the lease in question. He was in 'Charge of the company\u2019s offices which were maintained in the building in which the demised premises were located. He negotiated for leases of appellant\u2019s properties. He was the only representative of the company who came in contact with its tenants. In short, he was manager in fact, if not in name, of the .appellant\u2019s real estate holdings. We think, under the evidence, the jury was warranted in finding that Yates had apparent authority to enter into an agreement for the surrender of the lease. Commercial Hotel Co. v. Brill, 123 Wis. 638, 101 N. W. 1101. See also: Livieratos v. Commonwealth Security Co., 57 Wash. 376, 106 Pac. 1125; Brace v. Northern Pac. R. Co., 63 Wash. 417, 115 Pac. 841, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1135; Peninsular Sav. & Loan Ass\u2019n v. Breier Co., 137 Wash. 641, 243 Pac. 830; Mercy v. Hall & Son, Inc., 177 Wash. 338, 31 P. (2d) 1009.\nAppellant further contends: (1) That the agreement for surrender of the lease, being oral, is void under the statute of frauds; and (2) that the agreement was without consideration. As to the first contention: The agreement was executed when respondents relinquished possession and the appellant reentered the premises. Therefore, notwithstanding it rested in parol, it was not void under the statute of frauds. Hart v. Pratt, 19 Wash. 560, 53 Pac. 711. As to the second: The relinquishment by appellant and respondents of their mutual rights under the lease is sufficient consideration to support the agreement of. surrender. Ettlinger v. Kruger, 76 Misc. 540, 135 N. Y. Supp. 659; Eggers v. Paustian, 184 Iowa 1250, 169 N. W. 739. See, also, 1 Am. Jur. 988; La Plante v. Hubbard, 125 Wash. 621, 217 Pac. 20; Hunters Cattle Co. v. Carstens Packing Co., 129 Wash. 377, 225 Pac. 68.\nAppellant makes numerous other assignments of error, two of which we think call for a new trial.\nWhen respondents elected to stand on the agreement for surrender, appellant moved that the issue of constructive eviction be withdrawn from the jury. The court advised counsel that it would so instruct the jury in giving its instructions at the close of the testimony. This the court not only failed to do, but injected the issue by giving an instruction defining constructive eviction. Either in its instructions to the jury or at the time respondents elected to stand on the agreement for surrender, the court should have specifically withdrawn the issue of constructive eviction from the jury. Under the issues as made at the trial, respondents are entitled to recover damages only on the theory of interference with their occupancy of the premises \u2014 not on the theory of constructive eviction.\nThe court instructed the jury that, if they should find for appellant, they should allow as damages \u201cthe difference between the rent reserved in the lease and the reasonable rental value for the unexpired term.\u201d Elsewhere, the court correctly instructed the jury that, under a covenant such as that herein-before quoted, the lessor is entitled to recover the rent reserved to the end of the term less the amount actually received from subsequent tenants during the remainder of the term, provided it makes an honest and reasonable attempt to relet. 1 Tiffany, Landlord and Tenant, 1176; Metropolitan Nat.

The portion of the instruction just above quoted was prejudicially erroneous.\nThe judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded with directions to grant appellant\u2019s motion for new trial.\nMain, Millard, Robinson, and Simpson, JJ., concur."

From a judgment for the back rent and attorney\u2019s fees, the defendant appeals.\nThe court made the following findings of fact:\n\u201c(1) That plaintiff is a widow and the owner of certain real estate situate in the City of Yakima, Washington, more particularly described as Lots 21 and 22 in Block 11, in the City of Yakima, Washington, upon which there is situate a four story building commonly known as the Montana Hotel.\n\u201c(2) That plaintiff and defendant, on the 4th day of June, 1942, entered into a certain written lease, which lease is evidence in the above entitled action.\n\u201c(3) That under the terms and conditions of said lease, rental was reserved at $100.00 per month from July, 1942, to December, 1942, inclusive, and $150.00 thereafter.\n\u201c(4) That on the 31st day of December, 1942, a meeting was had at the office of the plaintiff between the defendant and Frank Mullins, plaintiff\u2019s Building Manager, and that at said time it was agreed that the defendant would continue to pay $100.00 per month instead of $150.00 per month until such time as business conditions were better, the said remaining $50.00 per month was to be paid when said conditions were better.\n\u201c(5) That defendant paid $100.00 per month up to the 1st day of July, 1943, at which time $110.00 per month was paid, the $10.00 being for additional room which had not previously been rented, though included in the lease; that receipts were given and checks paid.\n\u201c (6) That the plaintiff, on or about the 5th day of February, 1943, through her attorney, George Mullins, demanded the back rent. That on or about the 17th day of February, Notice to pay rent or vacate was served upon the defendant.\n\u201c(7) That beginning with the 1st day of March, 1944, the defendant paid the sum of $150.00, which sum has been accepted by the plaintiff.\n\u201c(8) That in view of the agreement and the actions of the parties, the lease could not be terminated for the nonpayment of full rental; and that insufficient evidence was submitted to grant a foreclosure under the terms and conditions of the lease.\n\u201c(9) That the plaintiff is entitled to recover judgment against the defendant in the sum of $610.00 together with interest of 6% per annum.\n\u201c(10) That the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in the sum of $125.00 as reasonable attorneys fees under the terms and conditions of the lease.\u201d\nThe appellant assigns as error the court\u2019s overruling of his demurrer, the denial of his motion to dismiss respondent\u2019s first cause of action, the granting of a judgment for the recovery of back rent and attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and the denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the court\u2019s decision or, in the alternative, for a new trial.\nThese assignments of error may be summed up as being based upon appellant\u2019s contention that the court erred in making its findings of fact, it being appellant\u2019s contention that the court should have found that there was, in fact, an oral modification of the written lease. This court will.not overturn the findings of fact of the trial court unless we find that the evidence preponderates against them. In this case, the court\u2019s findings are adequately sustained by the evidence and will not be disturbed. The citations of both the appellant and respondent touching modification of executory written instruments, and the apparent and implied authority of agents, would require consideration if the court\u2019s findings of fact were overturned. Since they are affirmed, however, the decision rests upon a pure question of fact, and they need not be discussed.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nBeals, C. J., Blake, and Robinson, JJ., concur."

    "St\u00e9inert, J.\nThe owner and lessor of certain real estate, on which were located several buildings used for shingle mill purposes, brought suit against his lessees upon their covenants to repair and to pay rent. In his complaint, he sought to recover the value of one of the buildings, which had been entirely destroyed by fire during the term of the lease, and, further, to recover the total amount of rent which would accrue under the lease during the unexpired portion of the term. The cause was tried to the court without a jury, and, at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the court granted ,the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the action and later entered judgment of dismissal.

The lessees to repair said buildings to suit their own purpose or use at their own expense.\n\u201cTo Have and to Hold, for the term of Five Years to-wit: from the 26th day of November, A.D. 1940, to the 30th day of November, A. D. 1946 [sic] yielding and paying therefor the monthly rent of Ten Dollars, lawful money of the United States of America.\n\u201cThe said lessee promises to pay the said rent as follows: Ten Dollars December 1st, 1940, and a like amount on the 1st day of each calander month to the end of the term and agrees to quit and deliver up the premises to the lessor, his agent or attorney, peaceably and quietly at the end of the term, in as good order, condition and repair as the reasonable use and wear thereof will permit. ...\u201d\nThe lease contained no exception clause relating to damage by fire or the elements.\nThe improvements on the premises at the time of the execution of the lease consisted of a shingle mill building large enough to accommodate four machines, a knee bolter, a swing cut-off, a log slip to the pond, a machine room, and a filing room; a lean-to; and a dry kiln.\nThe respondents entered into possession of the leased property, moved in some machinery, built two conveyors, and thereafter operated the shingle mill and paid the rent until May 2, 1941, when a fire broke out on the premises and, through no fault of any of the parties herein, entirely destroyed the shingle machine building and the structures connected with it, but did not damage the dry kiln. Since the fire, respondents have conducted no operations on the premises and have visited them but infrequently, although some of their machinery is still located thereon, subject to an attachment levied by the sheriff. The shingle machine building and structures connected with it have never been rebuilt, and respondents have refused to pay any further rent.\nConceiving that he was entitled to recover for the destruction of the shingle machine building and for continuing rent under the lease, appellant instituted this action. He alleged in his complaint, and respondents admitted in their answer, that the property had no rental value after the fire, and that appellant could not lease the premises for any sum. According to the evidence introduced by appellant, the value of the shingle machine building immediately before the fire was eight hundred fifty dollars, and the cost of rebuilding it would amount to about twelve hundred dollars.\nThe first question presented upon the appeal is whether or not, under the covenants contained in the lease, the respondents are required to rebuild the shingle machine building. This question requires a close analysis of the language in which the covenants of repair are set forth. Before entering upon that, however, it may be well to have before us the rule at common law relative to general covenants to repair demised premises. The rule and its effect have been fully and explicitly stated in several well-known texts and commentaries, from two of which we quote. In 3 Thompson, Real Property (Perm. ed. 1940) p. 516, \u00a7 1345, it is said:\n\u201cIt is the established rule of the common law that an express covenant to repair binds the covenantor to make good any injury which human power can remedy, even if caused by storm, flood, fire, inevitable accident, or the act of a stranger. The foundation of the rule is the doctrine that a person who has bound himself unconditionally can not be relieved, and that a covenant to repair is equivalent to a covenant to rebuild. Although a man may be excused from a duty imposed on him by law, if he is disabled from performing it without any fault of his own; yet when, by his own contract, he creates a duty or charge upon himself, he is bound to make it good, notwithstanding any accident by inevitable necessity. If it is urged that this is a- hardship upon the lessee, the answer is that it was his own folly to not stipulate against such inevitable consequences. So, the covenant of a lessee or lessor to repair is not discharged by the destruction of the premises by lightning, fire \u00f3r wind.\u201d\nFurther, on page 523, \u00a7 1347, it is said:\n\u201cThe general rule under the common law is that, in case the lessee covenants to keep the leased premises in repair and he does not qualify the same by special provision or exception, he is obligated under such covenant to rebuild even though the building is destroyed through no fault of his own. Under this rule, it is generally held that, if the lessee covenants to'deliver up the demised premises at the end of the term in good condition or repair, he is not excused or discharged from liability by reason of the accidental destruction of the premises by fire or other casualty without his fault.\u201d\nMany cases supporting the text are cited in the footnotes. In the body of the section from which we have last quoted, however, the author further says that in some jurisdictions the rule has been changed by statute, and in others it has been rejected entirely. This latter statement is also supported by citations in the footnotes.\nIn 32 Am. Jur. 675, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 791, appears the following statement:\n\u201cIt was the well-settled early common-law rule that a tenant\u2019s general covenant to repair the demised premises binds him under all circumstances, even though the injury proceeds from an act of God, from the elements, or from the act of a stranger or of a public enemy, and if he desires to relieve himself from liability for injuries resulting from any of the causes above enumerated, or from any other cause whatever, he must take care to except them from the operation of his covenant. Although in some jurisdictions the rule has been modified by statute or by the courts, there is much authority to the effect that a general covenant to keep the leased premises in repair, where not qualified by special provisions or exceptions, imposes upon the tenant the duty of rebuilding a structure upon the leased premises which accidentally falls or is in some manner destroyed, even though without the fault of the tenant. This rule has been laid down as to destruction by fire, although a contrary view has also been taken as to such destruction. If the tenant covenants to keep the premises in repair, and also covenants to insure them for a specific amount against fire, and they are burned down, it has been held that the tenant\u2019s liability on the former covenant is not limited to the amount to be insured under the latter covenant.\u201d\nThese statements of the paragraph just quoted are likewise fortified by the citation of cases in the footnotes to the text. Similar statements will also be found in .3 Tiffany, Real Property (3d ed.) pp. 567, 568, \u00a7 905; 2 Underhill, Landlord and Tenant, p. 882 et seq., \u00a7 528; 1 Taylor, Landlord and Tenant (9th ed.), p. 454, \u00a7 364 (the language of which is cited with approval in Armstrong v. Maybee, 17 Wash. 24, 48 Pac. 737, 61 Am. St. 898); 1 Wood, Landlord and Tenant (2d ed.), p. 808, \u00a7 370 (likewise cited with approval in Armstrong v. Maybee, supra); 36 C. J. 145, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 782. A full discussion of the subject, \u00e1ccompanied by an extensive list of cited cases, will be found in a lengthy annotation (1926) appearing in 45 A. L. R. 12, particularly at pages 58 to 67.\nSo far as we have been informed by briefs of counsel, or been able to discover from an independent search, there are but two cases in this jurisdiction which touch upon the question now under consideration: Armstrong v. Maybee, 17 Wash. 24, 48 Pac. 737, 61 Am. St. 898, and Arnold-Evans Co. v. Hardung, 132 Wash. 426, 232 Pac. 290, 45 A. L. R. 9. Both of these cases are cited by the authors of the texts above quoted as supporting the common-law rule therein stated. The Armstrong case presented a state of facts quite similar to those involved here, except in one vital particular, to which we shall refer specifically in our analysis of the covenant of repair relied upon by appellant.\nIn the Armstrong case, the plaintiff lessor brought action against his lessee for breach of covenant in a lease covering a shingle mill, dry house, office, mill machinery, and office fixtures, for a term of about fifteen months. The covenants upon which the action was grounded read as follows:\n\u201cThe lessee shall maintain all of the machinery and buildings of said mill in as good condition and repair as the same now are in and return the same to the lessor at the expiration of said lease in as good condition as the same are now in, reasonable wear and tear excepted. . . . That he (lessee) will maintain all the said mill, machinery and buildings in as good condition and repair as the same are now in, and return the same to lessor at the expiration or termination of this lease in as good condition as the same are now in, reasonable wear and tear from ordinary use alone excepted.\u201d (Italics ours.)\nAbout five months after the execution of the lease, the mill was entirely destroyed by fire. No question of negligence on the part of the lessee was raised at the trial. The trial court instructed the jury that the lease imposed upon the lessee an obligation to rebuild the mill in case it should be burned during the tenancy,, and that the lessee was under the obligation to return the mill to the lessor in as good condition as it was in at the time the lessee received it, reasonable wear and tear excepted. The lessee\u2019s appeal from an adverse judgment raised the question of the correctness of that instruction. In its approach to that question, this court proceeded upon the principle that, without an express covenant to rebuild, the lessee is under no obligation to do so. Further along in the opinion, the court approved the rule of construction stated by Judge Sherwood in a concurring opinion in the case of Van Wormer v. Crane, 51 Mich. 363, 16 N. W. 686, 47 Am. Rep. 582, that\n\u201cIn construing the covenants contained in a lease the cardinal rule is that the intention of the parties shall govern; and the courts will not extend or enlarge the obligation of the lessee beyond the plain meaning of the language used and the intention existing at the time it was made; and if there is not an express stipulation to the effect to restore buildings and other property leased, destroyed by casualties from fire or water, without fault or neglect on the part of the tenant, the loss must fall upon the landlord or reversioner.\u201d\nHowever, although adopting the general rule of construction as just quoted, this court held, in the Armstrong case, that the particular language of the covenants constituted an express general covenant to repair and imposed on the lessee the obligation to rebuild the mill which had been destroyed by fire. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed. We shall have occasion a little later to compare the covenants of the lease in the Armstrong case with those contained in the lease here under consideration.\nIn the Arnold-Evans Co. case, supra, the provisions of the lease with reference to repairs read:\n\u201c \u2018And It Is Hereby Agreed, that the parties of the second part [lessees] are to maintain and keep said building in good repair and return same at the \u00e9xpiration of this lease to the party of the first part [lessor], its heirs, administrators or assigns in as good condition as at the present time, excepting that first party will make repairs to the exterior of premises occasioned by reasonable use and wear thereof.\u2019 \u201d (Italics ours.)\nThe lease contained a further stipulation to the,effect that if the premises should be destroyed by fire or the lessees should be unable to occupy the premises because of fire, then the lessees should be entitled to a return of the unearned portion of the rent paid by them in advance.\nSometime thereafter, the boiler in the heating plant rusted out and required the installation of a new one. At the request of the lessees, a contractor installed a new boiler and later brought suit against both the lessees and the lessor for the contract price thereof. The lessees cross-complained against the lessor and asked that, if the contractor should obtain judgment against them, they in turn have judgment against the lessor. From a judgment adverse to them, the lessees appealed. In affirming the judgment, this court quoted from 16 R. C. L. 1088, \u00a7 605, which sets forth the rule as we have quoted it above from 32 Am.. Jur. 675, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 791, and announced its conclusion in one short paragraph reading as follows:\n\u201cThough the law may seem harsh as applied to this particular case, yet, for the general good, it must be maintained, and landlords and tenants alike must be left to guard against unusual conditions by the terms of their contracts.\u201d\nThus, it appears to be the settled law- in this state that an unconditional or unqualified covenant on the part of the lessee to maintain and keep premises leased by him in good repair or in as good condition as that existing at the time specified in the lease, and to return the premises at the expiration or termination of the lease in such equivalent condition, obligates the lessee to rebuild in case the buildings leased are destroyed by fire or other casualty during the term. So far as we have been advised, there is no statute in this state modifying this rule.\nThe crucial question here presented, then, is whether or not the phraseology of the particular covenant under consideration is sufficient to constitute a general covenant on the part of the lessees to repair and, at the expiration of the lease, return the premises to the lessor in as good condition as that existing at the time the lease was made and right of possession given thereunder.\nA comparison between the lease here involved and those in the Armstrong and Arnold-Evans cases, supra, brings to light some very distinctive and differentiating features. In each of the two cases last cited, the lessee obligated himself, by the terms of the lease, to maintain and keep the premises in as good condition as their then present condition, and to return them to the lessor, at the expiration of the term, in as good condition as they were in at the time designated in the lease. The covenants were clear, specific, and unconditional, constituting express covenants to repair. On the other hand, in this case, the covenant did not by its terms require the lessees to maintain or keep the premises in any particular condition whatever during the period of the term. The typewritten provisions of the lease simply recited that the lessees were \u201cto repair said buildings to suit their own purpose or use at their own expense.\u201d That provision merely obligated the lessees to install and pay for such repairs as suited their own purposes in the operation of the plant. It did not obligate them to maintain or keep the premises generally in the condition in which they had received them.\nFurthermore, the latter portion of the covenant (which was a part of the printed form of the lease) did not provide that the premises were to be returned in as good order, condition, and repair as they were in when the lease was executed or possession taken thereunder, but only \u201cin as good order, condition and repair as the reasonable use and wear thereof will permit.\u201d Whatever meaning may be given to the words \u201creasonable use and wear,\u201d as employed in the lease, it is at least certain that the covenant designated no point of time for the admeasurement of the condition in which the premises were to be returned to the lessor.\nUnder the provisions of the lease, the lessees were entitled to the possession and \u201creasonable use\u201d of the premises for the entire term, regardless of the fact that in the meantime a fire had destroyed one of the buildings thereon. Since the fire was a fortuity occurring without fault on the part of the lessees, it can as logically be said that the lessees were required merely to return the premises to the lessor at the expiration of the term in such \u201cgood order, condition and repair\u201d as reasonable use during the period after the fire would permit, as to say that they were required to deliver the premises in such \u201cgood order, condition and repair\u201d as reasonable use by them before the fire would permit. In other words, \u201creasonable use\u201d of the premises by the lessees can be said to permit, and therefore to require, only such return thereof as was possible by reason of a fire occurring without fault on the part of the lessees.\nThe covenant is at least capable of two constructions, but any ambiguity therein must be resolved in favor of the lessees, for it is well settled that, where a lease is capable of more than one construction, the courts will adopt that construction which is most favorable to the lessee. Salzer v. Manfredi, 114 Wash. 666, 195 Pac. 1046; Diettrich v. Newberry Co., 172 Wash. 18, 19 P. (2d) 115; National Bank of Commerce of Seattle v. Dunn, 194 Wash. 472, 78 P. (2d) 535; Murray v. Odman, 1 Wn. (2d) 481, 96 P. (2d) 489.\nIn any event, the common-law rule is so harsh that it ought not to be applied unless the language of the lease clearly requires it. While a lessee may bind himself by agreement to rebuild a structure which through no fault on .his part is destroyed by fire during the term of the lease, the obligation to do so must either appear by explicit language in the lease or else clearly come within the terms of a general covenant to repair and return the premises to the lessor, at the expiration of the term, in as good condition as they were in at the time the lease was given and possession taken thereunder. The covenant in this instance did not satisfy that standard of certainty and requirement, and we therefore hold that the trial court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s first cause of action.\nThe second question presented upon the appeal is whether, under the covenant to pay rent as recited in the lease, respondents were obligated to continue paying rent after the destruction of the shingle machine building, which was the main building on the leased premises. The covenant here under consideration required the respondents to \u201cpay the said rent as follows: Ten Dollars December 1st, 1940, and a like amount on the 1st day of each calander month to the end of the term.\u201d It is to be borne in mind that the lease in question covered not merely a building or portion of a building, but a certain described parcel of real estate with the buildings and improvements thereon.\nAgain we shall refer to the rule obtaining at common law. In 32 Am. Jur. 402, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 493, the rule and the reasons underlying it are stated at length, as follows:\n\u201cAccording to the common law as declared by the English courts and by a majority of the"

    "Blake, J.\nThis is an action for unlawful detainer. The defendant appeals from a judgment for restitution and damages, assessed in accordance with the provisions of Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 827 [P. C. \u00a7 7985].\nAppellant poses the question for determination as follows:\n\u201cDo the regulations of the Office of Price Administration modify and become the state law as to eviction of tenants, and make these regulations a part of the state law?\u201d\nWe do not think that question is in issue, for the action was brought, tried, and decided on the assumption that respondents\u2019 rights under the unlawful detainer statutes (Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 812 [P. C. \u00a7 7970] et seq.) were subject to regulations promulgated by the office of price administration pursuant to the provisions of the price control act of 1942 (chap. 26, 56 Stat. 23, 50 U. S. C. A. (Sup.), \u00a7901 et seq.). The pertinent regulation relates to hotels and rooming houses, and provides:\n\u201c(a) So long as the tenant continues to pay the rent to which the landlord is entitled, no tenant of a room within a hotel or rooming house shall be removed from such room, by action to evict or to recover possession, by exclusion from possession, or otherwise, nor shall any person attempt such removal or exclusion from possession, notwithstanding that such tenant has no lease or that his lease or other rental agreement has expired or otherwise terminated unless: . . .\n\u201c(5) The landlord seeks in good faith not to offer the room for rent. ...\u201d\nThe respondents, as lessees, operate a rooming house in Seattle known as the Roland Apartment Hotel. The appellant occupied room numbered 1 under a month to month tenancy. Pursuant to Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 812, and the regulations of the office of price administration, the respondents served due notice of termination of the tenancy, declaring:\n\u201c1. That the landlords in good faith do not intend to lease or offer said room for rent;\n\u201c2. The landlords owned the said housing accommodations prior to October 20, 1942, and seek in good faith to recover possession of such accommodations for immediate use and occupancy for dwelling purposes for themselves;\nDuring the progress of the trial, counsel for appellant stated: \u201cThe whole question in this case is a question of good faith.\u201d And that, under the issues made by the pleadings and the evidence presented at the trial, is the sole question for determination here. Among others, the trial court made the following findings:\n\u201cThat the plaintiffs desire room 1 .. . . occupied by the defendant, as a bed room for their daughter. . . . That no other room than defendant\u2019s room number one is available to plaintiffs for the purpose. That the plaintiffs need this additional space for privacy both for themselves and for said daughter. . . .\n. \u201cThe court further finds that the landlord plaintiffs in good faith do not intend to lease or offer said room for rent.\u201d\nThe evidence so overwhelmingly supports these findings that no useful purpose could be subserved by reviewing it here. Suffice to say: It is clear that respondents are en-\ntitled to possession of the premises in controversy both under Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 812 et seq., and the regulations of the office of price administration promulgated pursuant to the emergency price control act of 1942.\nJudgment affirmed.\nSimpson, C.

    "Steinert, J.\nPlaintiffs brought suit to recover treble damages for waste alleged to have been committed by defendants while in possession of plaintiffs\u2019 real property under a written lease. Upon a trial without a jury, the court determined the amount of damages actually sustained by plaintiffs and entered judgment therefor, but refused to treble the amount. Because of such refusal, plaintiffs appealed.\nThe facts as found by the trial court and recited in its formal findings are as follows:\nAppellants, Newton J. Graff ell and Edward D. Pitter, co-partners doing business under the name of Progressive Investment Co., are the owners of certain improved real estate located at, and described as, 2203 east Madison street, Seattle. At the time with which we are here concerned, respondent M. C. Honeysuckle, to whom we shall hereinafter refer as though he were the sole respondent, was appellants\u2019 tenant, having possession of the property under a written lease dated December 1, 1942, but executed March 1, 1943, and expiring by its terms on November 30, 1944. Respondent operated a dance hall in the building located on the premises. We quote directly two paragraphs of the court\u2019s findings, on the basis of which the court entered its judgment:\n\u201cVIII. That, on or about the 26th day of November, 1944, the defendants [respondents] M. C. Honeysuckle and Wife, vacated the said property and, about the said time, wrongfully, personally and through their agents, damaged the said property by removing parts of the said building and destroying other parts of same, to the reasonable loss and damage to plaintiffs [appellants] in the sum of $756.00, itemized as follows:\nDamage to dance floor necessitating\nrepairs .........................$500.00,\nDamage to band stand, necessitating\nreconstruction .................. 100.00,\nReplacing of electrical wiring...... 50.00,\nDamage to toilet................... 60.00,\nLoss of rental time................ 100.00, $756.00.\n[The above figures are exactly as they appear in the finding.]\n\u201cIX. That the said damages constituted waste under the laws of the State of Washington, and the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment in the amount of damages, together with their costs and a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee to be fixed by the Court. That a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee is the sum of Two Hundred Dollars.\u201d\nIn the preamble to the findings, reference is made to a memorandum opinion theretofore rendered by the trial court. The memorandum opinion goes more into detail with reference to the facts, and for that reason we refer to it as throwing light upon the situation here presented.\nPrior to the execution of the lease referred to above, the building on the premises, which had a sloping concrete floor, had been used as a motion picture theater. Respondent took the premises under a lease from appellants with the view of converting the building into a dance hall. This was accomplished by first placing upon the concrete floor a series of posts or pillars, as part of a general bridge construction comprised in part of heavy timbers, and superimposing thereon, first, a preliminary floor, and upon this a dance floor of maple or hardwood. A band platform was also built and certain electrical equipment installed. The work of alteration was done under the general supervision of city authorities and by them later approved. Upon completion of the work, respondent used the building as a dance hall until the end of his term, November 30, 1944. In September of that year, he was advised by appellants that the lease would not be renewed. Following this, certain correspondence passed, and certain conferences were held, between the parties with reference to respondent\u2019s request for an extension of the lease and his offer to sell to appellants the \u201cequipment\u201d in the building at the termination of the lease. Nothing, however, came of these proposals.\nA few days before the expiration of the lease, respondent, assisted by his employee, and with the use of claw bars and other equipment, tore up and dismantled all the hardwood from the dance floor, leaving the soft wood underneath it marred with nails and tool marks. Electrical switches and a toilet bowl were also removed.\nThere was conflict in the evidence as to whether the dance floor was originally constructed in such a way that it could be removed without injuring the building itself. The trial court found that the floor structure, bandstand, and other equipment were of a permanent character and were originally intended to be permanent fixtures attached to the building. The court stated in its memorandum opinion that, while it \u201cwould not be willing to find that the action of the defendant in the case was willful,\u201d nevertheless, under the existing statute applicable to the facts, it was incumbent upon the court to award appellants treble damages. In a later memorandum opinion, however, the court receded from its former view with reference to treble damages and concluded that, inasmuch as respondent had \u201cacted without malice or wrong intent,\u201d the existing statute, properly interpreted, did not warrant an award of treble damages.\nPursuant to the memorandum opinion, as modified, the court made its findings and entered its judgment as stated above.\n' There is but one question involved in this appeal, namely, whether the trial court erred in refusing to award appellants treble damages. The answer to that question calls for, and depends upon, the interpretation to be given to chapter 22, p. 40, Laws of 1943 (Rem. Supp. 1943, \u00a7 938 [P.P.C. \u00a7 103-3]), relating to waste and trespass.\nPrior to the passage of that act, the statute governing situations such as we have here was Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 938, originally enacted in 1869 and re-enacted in 1881. See chapter XLVIII, p. 143, \u00a7 555, Laws of Washington Territory, 1869, and chapter XLIX, p. 133, \u00a7 601, Code of 1881. That statute read as follows:\n\u201cIf a guardian, tenant in severalty, or in common, for life or for years, of real property, commit waste thereon, any person injured thereby may maintain an action at law for damages therefor against such guardian or tenant; in which action there may be judgment for treble damages, forfeiture of the estate of the party committing or permitting the waste, and of eviction from the property. But judgment of forfeiture and eviction shall only be given in favor of the person entitled to the reversion against the tenant in possession, when the injury to the estate in reversion is determined in the action, to be equal to the value of the tenant\u2019s estate or unexpired term, or to have been done or suffered in malice.\u201d (Italics ours.)\nThe origin of that statute and the conditions under which it would permit recovery in treble damages were considered and explained in DeLano v. Tennent, 138 Wash. 39, 244 Pac. 273, 45 A. L. R. 766. In that case, the owner of real property on which there were certain buildings leased the property to a tenant for a period of five years for use as a foundry. The lessee agreed, inter alia, not to commit or suffer waste, and to quit and surrender the premises at the end of the term in as good order and condition as they then were, or might \u201cbe put into.\u201d The lessee subsequently assigned the lease to another party. During the time the lessee or its assignee was in possession of the property, a number of structures were erected on the premises, useful in the business of conducting a foundry. These consisted, in part, of a core oven, an electrical transformer, a jib crane, and a hoist. There were also erected structures in the form of additions to the main buildings, and one new building. About a year prior to the expiration of the term of the lease, the assignee thereof moved its business to another site and quit entirely its use of the leased premises, although it continued regularly to pay the monthly rental. On moving from the premises, the assignee tore down and carried away all of the new structures which had been erected on the property during the time the lessee or assignee was in possession; it also tore down the core oven, destroyed the transformer, taking away all that was valuable of the materials of which it was composed, removed the crane and hoist, weakened the supports of the main building, and left the premises covered with debris.\nOn learning of the demolished condition of the premises, the owner brought suit to recover damages for injury to the property. The trial court determined the amount of damages and entered judgment in that amount, but refused to treble the amount so awarded. Both parties appealed. The plaintiff owner, on her appeal, contended (1) that the award of damages was insufficient and (2) that the court should have trebled the amount awarded.\nThis court held in that case that \u00a7 938, quoted above, permitted recovery of treble damages only where the waste is willful and wanton, and that, since the record did not show that the waste committed was of that sort, treble damages would not be allowed. In view of the fact that the cited case is the leading case construing that statute, we quote the language of the opinion bearing on the question of treble damages:\n\u201cThe second contention [with reference to treble damages] is founded on \u00a7 938 of the code (Rem. Comp. Stat.). This section provides that, if a tenant in severalty or in common of real property for life or for years commits waste thereon, any person injured thereby may maintain an action at law for damages therefor against such tenant, and further provides that in such action \u2018there may be judgment for treble damages.\u2019 But we cannot conclude that it is applicable to the facts here shown. The section in its present form first appears in the territorial Laws of 1869, p. 143, and has received no legislative modification since that time. Its language, as will be observed from the part we have quoted, is permissive rather than mandatory, and a reading of the entire act of which it forms a part convinces us that it was the legislative intent to provide for the punishment of wilful and wanton acts resulting in waste, rather than to make treble damages the ordinary measure in instances where the waste was the result of a mistaken view of rights entertained in good faith. This court early in its history announced the doctrine that the rule allowing recovery of exemplary and punitive damages was unsound in principle, and held that such damages were not recoverable in this jurisdiction, unless expressly so provided by statute. See the cases collected in Remington\u2019s Washington Digest, Title, Damages, \u00a7 \u00a7 40, 42. In this instance, as we have shown, the statute permits recovery in treble damages only where the waste is wilful and wanton, and the record does not show that the waste here committed was of that sort.\u201d\nIt will be noted that the court stressed (1) that the statute was permissive, rather than mandatory; (2) that a reading of the entire act (chapter XLVIII, Laws of 1869, chapter XLIX, Code of 1881, Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7\u00a7 938 to 941 [P.P.C. \u00a7\u00a7 103-3 to 103-9], inclusive) convinced the court that it was the legislative intent to punish willful and wanton acts resulting in waste, but not to make treble damages the ordinary measure of recovery where the waste was the result of a mistaken view of right entertained in good faith; and (3) that exemplary or punitive damages were not recoverable in this jurisdiction unless expressly so provided by statute.\nBearing in mind the grounds assigned by the court for its decision in the DeLano case, supra, we consider the language of the statute with reference to waste subsequently enacted by the legislature in 1943 (chapter 22, p. 40, Laws of 1943 (Rem. Supp. 1943, \u00a7 938)), amending Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 938, supra, only, but not amending \u00a7\u00a7 939, 940, 941. The amendatory act of 1943 reads:\n\u201cIf a guardian, tenant in severalty or in common, for life or for years, or by sufferance, or at will, or a sub-tenant, of real property commit waste thereon, any person injured thereby may maintain an action at law for damages therefor against such guardian or tenant or sub-tenant; in which action, if the plaintiff prevails, there shall be judgment for treble damages, or for fifty dollars ($50), whichever is greater, and the court, in addition may decree forfeiture of the estate of the party committing or permitting the waste, and of eviction from the property. The judgment, in any event, shall include as part of the costs of the prevailing party, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to be fixed by the court. But judgment of forfeiture and eviction shall only be given in favor of the person entitled to the reversion against the tenant in possession, when the injury to the estate in reversion is determined in the action to be equal to the value of the tenant\u2019s estate or unexpired term, or to have been done or suffered in malice.\u201d (Italics ours.)\nThe words and phrases which have been italicized above are additions to the earlier act (Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 938) except that the verbal phrase \u201cthere may be judgment\u201d in the earlier act was changed to \u201cthere shall be judgment\u201d in the 1943 act.\nA careful reading of the amendatory act discloses that the legislature expressly did, or intended to do, several things which it had not done or provided for in the earlier act: (1) It substituted the mandatory words \u201cshall be\u201d for the permissive words \u201cmay be\u201d in connection with the word \u201cjudgment\u201d; (2) it provided expressly that, in an action brought by any injured person for waste committed on real property by a guardian, tenant, or subtenant, the condition prerequisite to recovery of treble damages was simply \u201cif the plaintiff prevails,\u201d and not the willfulness or wantonness of the act committed; and (3) it accepted and unqualifiedly applied, in actions for waste, the rule of treble damages, which are punitive in nature. By express provision, therefore, the legislature met every objection which this court had raised against a recovery of treble damages in the DeLano case, supra.\nWith reference to the amendatory statute, several other things may be noted: (1) The change in the wording of the statute was made as an amendment to Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 938, alone, and not as a general revision of a comprehensive legislative act containing that section and several others as well; (2) the statute as it now reads makes the rendition of judgment for treble damages mandatory upon the court, while the granting of a decree of forfeiture and eviction is merely permissive, thus recognizing and preserving the distinction between the words \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay\u201d; (3) it. provides that \u201cmalice\u201d shall be indispensable to a decree of forfeiture and eviction, but not to a judgment for treble damages; and (4) it provides for treble damages in case of waste committed, and for forfeiture and eviction in case of waste either committed or suffered.\n\u201cWaste,\u201d as understood in the law of real property and as variously defined by this court, is an unreasonable or improper use, abuse, mismanagement, or omission of duty touching real estate by one rightfully in possession which results in its substantial injury. It is the violation of an obligation to treat the premises in such manner that no harm be done to them, and that the estate may revert to those having an underlying interest undeteriorated by any willful or negligent act. Moore v. Twin City Ice & Cold Storage Co., 92 Wash. 608, 159 Pac. 779, Ann. Cas. 1918D, 540. For other definitions, see 44 Words and Phrases (Perm, ed.) 703 et seq.\nWaste may be either voluntary or permissive. Voluntary waste, sometimes spoken of as commissive waste, consists of the commission of some deliberate or voluntary destructive act, such as pulling down a house, or removing things fixed to and constituting a material part of the freehold. Permissive waste implies negligence or omission to do that which will prevent injury, as, for instance, to suffer a house to go to decay for want of repair or to deteriorate from neglect. 3 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary (Rawle\u2019s 3d ed.) 3433; 32 Words and Phrases (Perm ed.) 161; 44 Words and Phrases (Perm, ed.) 438.\nThe waste for which respondent was held liable\u2019 in this case was of the voluntary, or commissive, type. It resulted from destructive acts voluntarily and intentionally committed by him, to the injury of appellants\u2019 estate in freehold.\nThis brings us directly to the question whether a judgment for treble damages for waste resulting from an act voluntarily and intentionally, though not maliciously, done is made mandatory by the 1943 statute, quoted above. This requires a judicial construction of the statute.\nThe fundamental object or purpose of all judicial construction or interpretation is to ascertain, if possible, and to give effect to, the intention of the lawmakers in enacting the particular statute. Layton v. Home Indemnity Co., 9 Wn. (2d) 25, 113 P. (2d) 538; Lynch v. Department of Labor & Industries, 19 Wn. (2d) 802, 145 P. (2d) 265.\nIt has frequently been declared that, in the process of arriving at the intent of the legislative body, the first resort of the courts is to the context and subject matter of the legislation, because the intention of the lawmaker is to be deduced, if possible, from what it said. Lynch v. Department of Labor & Industries, supra, and cases therein cited.\nIn enacting legislation upon a particular subject, the lawmaking body is presumed to be familiar not only with its own prior legislation relating to that subject, but also with the court decisions construing such former legislation. In re Levy, 23 Wn. (2d) 607, 161 P. (2d) 651, 162 A. L. R. 805. This rule was applied in the case of Sandahl v. Department of Labor & Industries, 170 Wash. 380, 16 P. (2d) 623, wherein this court said:\n\u201cWhen the legislature made the amendments in 1927, it was presumed to have in mind the existing statutory provisions and the judicial construction which had been placed upon them. To discover the legislative intent, the original statutes, and as they read as amended, are to be taken into consideration.\u201d\nIn construing statutes which re-enact, with certain changes, or repeal other statutes, or which contain revisions or codification of earlier laws, resort to repealed and superseded statutes may be had, and is of great importance in ascertaining the intention of the legislature, for, where a material change is made in the wording of a statute, a change in legislative purpose must be presumed. In re Phillips\u2019 Estate, 193 Wash. 194, 74 P. (2d) 1015, and cases therein cited; Great Northern R. Co. v. Cohn, 3 Wn. (2d) 672, 101 P. (2d) 985; Longview Co. v. Lynn, 6 Wn. (2d) 507, 108 P. (2d) 365.\nThis rule was applied in In re Eichler\u2019s Estate, 102 Wash. 497, 173 Pac. 435, where the court was called upon to construe a statute which substituted a discretionary power in the probate court to award costs in will contests in place of the arbitrary rule of a former statute which required that costs and expenses be paid by the unsuccessful contestant. The court said:\n\u201cTo measure the present law we must consider the old law, for a presumption carries in all changes in statute law that the legislature had in mind a mischief (a mischief of various rules, 40 Cyc. 1362), and a remedy, and we must attribute a motive for the striking out of the arbitrary provisions of the old law and a substitution of a discretionary power to award costs and attorney\u2019s fees unhampered by any restrictions within the realm of reasonable discretion.\u201d\nThe following statement, taken from 50 Am. Jur. 261, Statutes, \u00a7 275, expresses the general attitude of the various courts in construing amendatory statutes:\n\u201cIn making material changes in the language of a statute, the legislature cannot be assumed to have regarded such changes as without significance, but must be assumed to have had a reasonable motive. Where a statute is amended, it will not be presumed that the difference between the two statutes was due to oversight or inadvertenc"

    "Robinson, J.\nThis is an action for rent.\nOn March 29, 1929, George A. Mottman and wife leased a ground floor room in the Mottman building, a five-story structure in Seattle, to the Western Union Telegraph Company, for a period of ten years, beginning on April 1, 1929. The lessee occupied the premises as a branch office for the receipt and delivery of telegrams. In March, 1934, the lessors transferred their interest to The Mottman Mercantile Company.\nOn the evening of January 19, 1938, a fire broke out on the fifth floor of the building. The fire was confined to that floor, but the water used in extinguishing it was not. In this connection, the answer alleges:\n\u201cThat the Fire Department of the City of Seattle, in extinguishing said fire, poured large quantities of water on the premises above those occupied by the defendant, and that a very large amount of such water seeped into the premises occupied by the defendant and did such extensive damage thereto as to render said premises untenantable and unfit for occupancy of any kind for a period of at least ten days subsequent to January 19, 1938; that even after removal of such water from the premises occupied by the defendant it would have been necessary to make substantial repairs to said premises in order to render them tenantable or fit for occupancy.\u201d\nThe lease contained the following provision:\n\u201cIn case the building on said premises, or that portion of such building leased by the party of the second part, shall be destroyed, or be so injured by the elements, or any other cause, as to be untenantable and unfit for occupancy, the party of the second part shall not be liable or bound to pay rent to said party of the first part for the same after such destruction or injury, and may thereupon, at its option, quit and surrender possession of the premises; but may if it so desire, upon the completion of the repair or restoration of said building reoccupy the same, or such portion as aforesaid, upon the terms and conditions herein set forth, the rental to commence from the date of such reoccupation.\u201d\nUpon the theory that the premises had been rendered \u201cuntenantable and unfit for occupancy,\u201d the defendant began removing its records and appliances, and on January 24th, five days after the fire, it tendered the rent then owing, informed the plaintiff that it elected to cancel the lease and surrender the premises. This action, however, was foreshadowed on the morning after the fire occurred. The defendant\u2019s manager testified that, on that morning, the plaintiff\u2019s rental agent told him that he would have the premises cleaned up at once, and that he replied that they could not be cleaned up, as water was still coming through. He further testified that he then and there decided to cancel the lease, and that he welcomed the opportunity because of the exorbitant rent his company was paying.\nPlaintiff recovered a jury verdict. The defendant, as appellant here, urges that the trial court erred in not granting its motion for judgment notwithstanding, and in the matter of instructions given and refused.\nAn examination of the statement of facts reveals extraordinarily violent conflicts in the evidence. The defendant called six witnesses, all but one of whom were its own employees. At least three of these spoke of the water on the floor of the premises, after the fire, as being an inch deep in spots; the lowest estimate being one-half inch. They testified that the water came through the tin-covered ceiling in at least fifteen places, and used such descriptive expressions as: \u201cIt ran like water out of a faucet\u201d and \u201ccame down in streams.\u201d And several said it continued to do so, though in lesser amounts, the next day, and even the fourth day thereafter; and one, that it was still dripping alongside the central light fixture on February 10th, almost three weeks after the fire. As to the side walls, one said that it came down in a steady stream fifteen feet wide. Two of them described it as still coming down in sheets the next afternoon.\nAt least an equal number of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, one or two of whom appeared to be disinterested, observed the premises at substantially the same times. Two of them described the floor as looking about like a wet sidewalk; one said, like a floor which somebody had scrubbed but forgot to mop dry. One even said the floor was dry. All of them denied seeing any water coming through the ceiling at any time. As to the walls, they conceded that they were somewhat stained and streaked, especially the north wall. Only one of them admitted seeing any water running down the walls, and this, he said, was a trickle about the width of a lead pencil. All of the witnesses agreed as to one thing, however, and that was that no plaster came off the walls.\nMuch was made of the fact that a restaurant on the same floor, though some twenty feet away, served breakfast as usual on the morning after the fire and never at any time discontinued business, although some water seeped down the side walls of the room.\nThere was testimony that the Western Union quarters could have been thoroughly dried out in thirty-six hours, that the walls could have been recalcimined in six, and that this work could have been done at night. At least two witnesses gave the opinion that the defendant could have continued business, although, for the first few days, with some discomfort. There was evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s architect, after examining the premises, advised that the only repairs necessary were to repaint the ceiling, calcimine the walls, and fix the lock on the door, and that these were the actual repairs ultimately made.\nThe major question presented on the appeal relates to instructions given and refused. The conflict between the instructions given and those requested is direct. The jury was instructed that the premises would not be rendered \u201cuntenantable and unfit for occupancy\u201d\n\u201c . . . if the condition of the said premises following said fire could be restored to a fit condition by ordinary repairs or services without unreasonable interruption of the business of the defendant, ...\u201d\nThe defendant\u2019s theory may be shown by the quotation of a sentence or two from its requested instructions:\n\u201cThe words \u2018untenantable and unfit for occupancy,\u2019 as used in the lease, mean a condition of the premises which would render them unsatisfactory for the normal conduct of the defendant\u2019s business therein,\u201d\nor,\n\u201cIf you find that the leased premises were rendered untenantable and unfit for occupancy, as alleged in plaintiff\u2019s complaint, but that the premises could have been restored to the state of tenantability and fitness for occupancy by the making of repairs, your verdict must nevertheless be in favor of the defendant.\u201d\nThat is to say, if the premises were rendered unsatisfactory for the normal conduct of the defendant\u2019s business therein, the right to cancel became ipso facto complete; and whether or not the premises could be restored to a fit condition without unreasonable interruption of the business, is wholly immaterial. It would seem, under this theory, that, if the glass front of a grocery was suddenly knocked out in subzero weather, the grocer could cancel his lease, even if the glass could be replaced within a few hours, for the theory rigidly excludes all questions as to the reasonableness of interruption and insists that the question \u2014 Were the premises rendered unsatisfactory for the normal conduct of the business? \u2014 is the sole test.\nAppellant\u2019s contention is supported by an exhaustive and scholarly brief. Unfortunately, the argument must lose much of its force when condensed to the mere outline to which we must confine it. It is first pointed out that, at common law, even if a leased building was completely destroyed by fire, the lessee, nevertheless, remained liable for the full amount of the rent. The practical working of this rule proved so harsh under modern conditions that, in some states, statutes were adopted relieving tenants from its consequences, and it long since became the practice to insert special provisions in leases to accomplish that result. These special provisions range from those relieving the tenant only in case of complete destruction to those where he is relieved where the premises are rendered \u201cuntenantable and unfit for occupancy,\u201d and provisions even more liberal are not unusual.\nIt is conceded that many courts have held that the words \u201cuntenantable and unfit for occupancy,\u201d as used in statutes and lease provisions, mean only a condition where the damage is so great that it cannot be repaired without an unreasonable interruption to the tenant\u2019s business. The following are cited as typical examples: Barry v. Herring, 153 Md. 457, 138 Atl. 266; Basketeria Stores v. Shelton, 199 N. C. 746, 155 S. E. 863; Schulte, Inc. v. American Realty Corp., 256 Mass. 258, 152 N. E. 233; Wolff v. Turner, 6 Ga. App. 366, 65 S. E. 41; Sherrill v. Kirklin-York Co., 202 S. W. (Tex. Civ. App.) 775; see, also, 2 Underhill on Landlord and Tenant, 1349, \u00a7 792.\nIt is contended that such decisions, although in line with the weight of authority, have been unduly influenced by the old common law concepts, and that they completely disregard the sound and universally acknowledged principle that men have the right to make their own contracts and, as corollary to that, the right to have the words they use in so doing interpreted in accordance with their usual and ordinary meaning. It is insisted that the words \u201cuntenantable and unfit for occupancy,\u201d as used in present day leases, should be given their usual and ordinary meaning.\nThe appellant urges that the courts of some jurisdictions have long ago freed themselves from the influence of the old common law concept, and cites as examples the following cases: New York Real Estate & Bldg. Imp. Co. v. Motley, 143 N. Y. 156, 38 N. E. 103; Tallman v. Murphy, 120 N. Y. 345, 24 N. E. 716; Roman v. Taylor, 93 App. Div. 449, 87 N. Y. Supp. 653; Trumbull v. Bombard, 171 App. Div. 700, 157 N. Y. Supp. 794; Daly v. Schenk, 8 N. J. Misc. 697, 151 Atl. 637; Acme Ground Rent Co. v. Werner, 151 Wis. 417, 139 N. W. 314; Denkham v. Madole, 194 Wis. 583, 217 N. W. 423. While the general discussion of the matter in appellant\u2019s brief is logical and forceful, we do not find these cases very persuasive. In none of them is there a general discussion of the question involved. About the only pertinent general statement is found in Tallman v. Murphy, where, with reference to the words \u201cuntenantable and unfit for occupancy,\u201d the majority opinion says: \u201cThe statute contemplates an injury to the building which substantially affects the enjoyment of it by the tenant.\u201d In several of the cases, the premises would have been held untenantable under either of the theories under discussion.\nFurthermore, in each of the cases cited, the respective courts were construing the words under discussion as used in statutes; and they had, and realized that they had, a legislative sanction for making a liberal construction in favor of the tenant. It is said, in the second of the Wisconsin cases, citing and quoting a number of decisions from other jurisdictions to support the statement, that:\n\u201cThe plaintiffs contend that the statute is to be strictly construed as it is in derogation of the common law, but it clearly appears that the statute was intended to relieve tenants from the rigors of the common law, and we think it should be liberally construed to give it the legislative intent.\u201d\nThe appellant further contends that it is very apparent that the parties in this case, in arranging their lease, were not intent upon common law language, but intended to define their respective rights in their own way; and, in support of this, it is pointed out that, after providing for cancellation, if the premises became untenantable, they went on to include a long, involved, and unprecedented provision to the effect that, even though the premises should be rendered untenantable, the tenant should have the option to reoccupy the premises upon their restoration and repair. Hence, it is said that all of the words in the lease should be given their usual and ordinary meaning.\nFinally, it is urged that the matter is of first impression in this jurisdiction, and, therefore, that no consideration of stare decisis forbids our discarding the allegedly outworn common law concept and holding that the words \u201cuntenantable and unfit for occupancy,\u201d as used in leases, mean simply a condition which renders the premises unsatisfactory for the normal conduct of the tenant\u2019s business; and that the length of the interruption is in no way involved. It is contended that this is not only the more logical rule, but that it is more susceptible to certain application than one which leaves a question of reasonableness to be decided by court or jury.\nIt is conceded that the phrase which we have had under discussion is used in many leases written in this state. If it be true that we have not hitherto interpreted it, then the draftsmen of such leases must have relied upon the meaning given to it by the majority of the decisions rendered in the courts of our sister states; and that, as appellant admits, is contrary to the rule for which it contends and in accordance with the instruction given by the court. If we should adopt the rule contended for, serious consequences might follow. For example, leases which have ten, twenty, or thirty years to run and whose continuance involves the continuance of collateral arrangements involving the well-being of minor heirs, cestui que trusts, etc., might be canceled because the tenant\u2019s complete enjoyment of the premises was, by some wholly fortuitous event, interrupted for a single day.\nPerhaps, this is an instance where flexibility is preferable to certainty. Let us suppose a case where a lease has but two months to run, and another where the unexpired term is twenty years, and that, in each instance, by some fortuitous event, the premises are rendered unsatisfactory for the normal conduct of the tenant\u2019s business for a period of two or three days. Under the rule for which appellant contends, the right to cancel would be absolute in both cases. Variations in length of unexpired terms, as well as variations in other circumstances, would seem to make a more flexible rule desirable. But if this is not so, there is nothing to prevent lessors and lessees who desire the rule contended for by appellant from discontinuing the use of the words \u201cuntenantable and unfit for occupancy,\u201d and providing that the tenant may cancel when, for any reason, the premises are rendered unsatisfactory for the conduct of his business therein. In any event, in our opinion, it is not for the court to radically alter, by judicial decision, a generally accepted rule of real estate law.\nThere is a further contention that instruction No. 5, even if correct in content, is objectionable in form, in that it is said to be argumentative and one-sided. The instruction is, perhaps, somewhat open to this criticism, but we cannot believe that it had any prejudicial effect.\nThe judgment appealed from is affirmed.\nBlake, C. J., Main, Millard, and Simpson, JJ., concur."

    "Mallery, J.\nThis appeal involves a residence located in the city of Olympia. The defendant Sanstrom, hereinafter referred to as though she were the sole defendant in this case, purchased the property in 1945 and sold it on contract to one Kolton in the same year. These transactions were handled by a realtor, who, in addition to functioning as a real-estate agent for the purpose of the sale of the property, rendered the defendant some services as a general agent by way of collecting the payments on the contract. While Kolton was purchasing the property, defendant obtained a loan secured by a mortgage on it. The contract payments were then sent by the agent directly to the mortgagee bank, it being defendant\u2019s intention that the mortgage would be paid in this manner.\nOn December 17, 1945, the realtor sold Kolton\u2019s real-estate contract interest in the property to one Williams. The defendant was not concerned in this transaction. Instead of the original contract of sale being assigned to Williams, the realtor submitted to the defendant a new contract running directly from her to Williams, which she executed. She did not know Williams and received nothing for permitting this substitution of purchasers.\nThis procedure was repeated on August 16, 1946, when the plaintiffs purchased Williams\u2019 contract. The realtor, as agent for Williams in making this sale of his contract, represented to the plaintiffs that the sewer was connected directly to the city sewer, when, in fact, it was connected'only to a neighbor\u2019s sewer. Again, defendant was not present, had no interest in the transaction, and was unaware of it until a new contract was sent to her for execution as before.\nSometime prior to April, 1948, the plaintiffs found it necessary to disconnect their sewer from that of their neighbor and connect it directly to the city sewer at a cost of $402.43. In the meantime, the plaintiffs being in default of their monthly payments for January, February, March and April, 1947, the defendant had been obliged to make the payments due on the mortgage out of her separate funds.\nIn July, 1949, the defendant was informed by the realtor that the taxes on the property were unpaid for the preceding three years, so she paid them and under the terms of the contract had a right to add them to the purchase price. Defendant was also informed that there was a balance, after deduction of contract payments due, of two hundred dollars owing on the sewer repairs, it being the realtor\u2019s assumption that she was liable for the cost thereof.\nOn August 19, 1949, the defendant, through her attorneys, notified the plaintiffs that their contract would be forfeited if the default in payments was not cured within five days. The plaintiffs thereupon brought this action, seeking recovery of $402.43, the cost of the new sewer connection, and to quiet their right of possession under their contract. The defendant counterclaimed, praying for a forfeiture of the contract.\nA trial to the court resulted in a judgment for the plaintiffs on the questions of forfeiture of the contract and their claim for $402.43 expended for construction of the sewer.\nDefendant appeals, making ten assignments of error. Appellant\u2019s first, second and eighth assignments are directed to the finding of the trial court that the realtor was appellant\u2019s agent, and that his representation as to the sewer was binding on her.\nThis action, aside from asking damages, is, in effect, one for specific performance, and is before this court as a trial de novo. We are therefore required to examine the evidence and the circumstances and from such examination determine whether or not the result reached was correct. Wingard v. Pierce County, 23 Wn. (2d) 296, 160 P. (2d) 1009; Widman v. Maurer, 19 Wn. (2d) 28, 141 P. (2d) 135. The question is whether a proper decree was rendered, and the reasoning of the trial court is not controlling. Rohlinger v. Coletta Land & Orchard Co., 64 Wash. 348, 116 Pac. 1095.\nWe are of the opinion that the evidence does not sustain the holding of the trial court that the realtor was the agent of appellant when respondents became the purchasers. Respondents knew they were purchasing Williams\u2019 equity even though a contract was obtained direct from the appellant, who was unaware of the negotiations until the contract was forwarded for her signature. The sale was, in effect, between Williams and respondents, and the realtor was representing Williams for the purposes of that transaction. Any recourse that respondents may have for misrepresentation by the seller of the contract must be against Williams, if authorized by him, otherwise against the realtor.\nThis point was not discussed in the briefs of either party. The contentions, as to this phase, were over whether or not there had been a waiver of the sewer defect by the respondents. We do not reach the question of waiver in view of our finding that appellant could not have been bound by the statements of the realtor, because he was not her agent in the transaction with respondents. Accordingly, this portion of the judgment must be reversed. See Davis v. San-derlin, 119 N. C. 84, 25 S. E. 815.\nThe remaining seven assignments are grounded upon appellant\u2019s contention that the notice of forfeiture of August 19, 1949, was a good and sufficient notice.\nIt is the well-established rule in this state, where time is made the essence of a contract of sale, that the vendor may declare a forfeiture for the nonpayment of any installment. Dill v. Zielke, 26 Wn. (2d) 246, 173 P. (2d) 977; Barrett v. Bartlett, 189 Wash. 482, 65 P. (2d) 1279.\nHowever, the vendor, by his conduct, may waive strict performance by not giving notice of forfeiture when payments are in default, by accepting later payments, or by granting other indulgences. Franklin v. Gilbert Ice Cream Co., 191 Wash. 269, 71 P. (2d) 52; Wadham v. McVicar, 115 Wash. 503, 197 Pac. 616.\nNot only did appellant acquiesce in respondents\u2019 failure to make timely payments during January, February, March and April of 1947 by the acceptance of later payments, but she also paid all of the taxes for the three years during the existence of the contract. Under the facts stated, appellant was obligated to notify the defaulting purchaser of her intention to declare a forfeiture and allow a reasonable time in which to bring the contract up to date. We do not feel, in view of the amount involved and the existence of a bona fide dispute as to the rights of the parties, that five days was a reasonable time.\nAccordingly, the judgment is affirmed, with a modification to the extent of striking therefrom the provision allowing respondents credit upon the contract to the amount of $402.43 for the sewer repairs. The thirty days for bringing the payments due under the contract up to date which is allowed by the judgment, will date from the going down of the remittitur herein.

    "Finley, J.\nThis is an action for unlawful detainer based upon a claim by the respondent lessor of nonpayment of rent by the appellant corporation, lessee under a written lease for a term of ten years, of a certain tract of land in Seattle. The land in question contains a service station, and is a part of a larger tract which the respondent, prior to the execution of the lease in question, had itself leased from the King county property department. With respect to rental, the l'ease of the service station property provides as follows:\n\u201c3. Rental. Lessee agrees to pay monthly as rental for said premises as follows:\n\u201c(a) An amount equal to one cent (l(\u00ed) a gallon on the volume of gasoline sold each month, and\n\u201c(b) An amount equal to four per cent (4%) of the gross retail and wholesale sales other than gasoline for each calendar month; provided, however, that the minimum rental to be paid for each month is Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00).\n\u201cLessee further agrees it will pay monthly an additional rental of one-eighth (%) of one per cent (1%) on all gross sales, both retail and wholesale, and including all sales of gasoline, less state and federal taxes.\n\u201cAll rentals due under this lease shall he paid to King County Property Department to the extent that said payments are equal to or less than $1,252.00 per month, and such rental shall he transmitted as agent of Buford Enterprises, Inc.\u201d (Italics ours.)\nClaiming that appellant was in default in the payment of rent for the months of November and December 1957 and January 1958, respondent, on January 25, 1958, served notice to pay rent or vacate. Subsequently, on March 18, 1958, respondent instituted this action for unlawful detainer. Appellant denied that it was in default in the payment of rent. In support of this denial it was alleged that the appellant corporation and its president, Buford V. Seals, were holders of certain promissory notes issued by the respondent, and that, on or about December 19, 1957, the parties had entered into an oral agreement whereby the rental then due and thereafter accruing was to be credited by the appellant against the amount due on the notes. No allegation was made that this oral agreement had been executed.\nOver the respondent\u2019s objection the trial court admitted evidence of the alleged oral agreement, including some but not all of the notes upon which the lessee relied. The only testimony relating to the agreement itself was given by Seals, appellant\u2019s president, and Andrew G. Bennett, who is the respondent\u2019s president. This testimony was in direct conflict. The case was submitted to the jury, which returned a verdict in favor of the respondent lessor in the amount of $4,497.82, representing the rental due under the lease from November 1, 1957, to the date of the start of the trial. Denying the appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the trial judge entered a judgment for the respondent on the verdict.\nAppellant\u2019s assignments of error relate to (1) the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit into evidence certain of the promissory notes; (2) certain rulings made as to the permissible scope of cross-examination of the two primary witnesses, Bennett and Seals; and (3) certain of the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury.\nHowever, as we view the case, it is unnecessary for us to consider any of these assignments. Respondent contended below, and reiterates on this appeal, that no evidence of the alleged oral agreement should have been admitted for the reason that the agreement constitutes a modification of the written lease. We agree.\nA lease required by law to be in writing cannot be modified by parol, except so far as the oral modification has become executed; that is, a lessor is bound by a parol agreement modifying the covenant to pay rent contained in a lease required by law to be in writing only in so far as such agreement has become executed. City Mortgage Co. v. Diller (1935), 180 Wash. 499, 40 P. (2d) 164. It is a statutory (RCW 59.04.010) prerequisite to the creation of a tenancy of real estate for a longer period than from month to month that the lease be in writing and acknowledged before a notary public, and, therefore, the ten-year lease under which the appellant held the service station property was required by law to be in writing.\nFinally, as we have noted, the appellant has made no claim that the agreement was executed. It, therefore, follows that the respondent is not bound by the alleged agreement even if, in fact, such an agreement was made. Thus, the judgment of the trial court in favor of the respondent should be affirmed. It is so ordered.\nWeaver, C. J., Mallery, Donworth, and Ott, JJ., concur."

    "Mallery, J.\nThe plaintiff, Inland Securities Company, Inc., owned a 5.3-acre tract of land upon which there were bunkers for sorting sand and gravel. Contiguous thereto were tracts of land with commercial quantities of sand and gravel, owned respectively by the Ross Construction Company and Leo S. Ross, individually. It should be noted that the Ross Construction Company and Leo S. Ross, individually, are not parties to this action.\nThe defendant, by its president, Eugene J. Auve, negotiated with plaintiff, through its president, Leo S. Ross, for a lease of the bunkers and the purchase of sand and gravel. They went upon and examined the three mentioned premises. Defendant agreed to lease these lands for three hundred dollars a month, which would give it the use of the bunkers and the right to take all the sand and gravel needed in its business at the rate of seven and one-half cents a yard for sand, and five cents a yard for gravel. Defendant was not aware that the lease executed and delivered by the plaintiff did not include the two adjoining properties bargained for, which contained practically all of the usable deposits of sand and gravel, and from which about ninety per cent of those materials were, in fact, taken. This is explained by the fact that the land described lacked landmarks, and could only be located by a surveyor.\nAfter defendant had been operating upon the premises for some time, it constructed a culvert for the convenience of its vehicles and repaired the gravel hopper, which had been damaged by fire. Its claim for reimbursement from plaintiff for these items precipitated the .controversy which ended in the instant litigation, when it attempted to offset these costs against accrued rental.\nTwo days before the suit for the rental was commenced, the secretary of plaintiff corporation had a conversation with the president of defendant corporation, who testified:\n\u201cA. He said unless we paid immediately, that he would either sue us or ask us to vacate the property. ... I told him, \u2018You have a provision in your lease that you can ask us to vacate, but why don\u2019t you give us notice and we will vacate?\u2019 Q. What did he say to that, if anything? A. Well, he said, \u2018We are not going to ask you to vacate the property, you have leased, but we are going to ask you. to stop taking gravel from the adjoining property.\u2019 \u201d\nThe president of defendant corporation thereupon investigated the description in the lease and discovered for the first time that the sand and gravel had been extracted from the lands bargained for, but, in fact, actually outside of the description in the lease. Thereupon, defendant counterclaimed, in the instant action, for a rescission of the lease and for damages.\nAt the commencement of the action, there was a considerable quantity of sand and gravel stock-piled on the property. It was stipulated by. the parties that it might be removed by defendant at specified royalties, which was done.\nThe judgment herein awarded plaintiff a sum for rental and royalties; rescinded the lease; and allowed attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to neither party. The plaintiff appeals.\nAppellant assigns the rescission of the lease as error. It is true respondent suffered no accrued monetary damage by reason of the wrong description in the lease, and that it took sand and gravel as if the description had been correct. However, after the conversation heretofore set out, the appellant did not offer to give respondent what it bargained for by securing for respondent the lease of Leo S. Ross to the land owned by him, and a lease of the Ross Construction Company to its land. Respondent\u2019s right to a rescission of the lease is predicated upon the fact that for the balance of the term it will not have what it bargained for, and not on account of any past monetary loss. Appellant cannot relegate respondent to trespasses upon the Leo S. Ross and Ross Construction Company lands in order to get what it bargained for. They are not parties hereto, and the court has no power to adjudicate their rights or excuse future trespasses without them having had their day in court.\nAppellant contends that respondent is estopped from challenging its rights in the leased land upon the principle that a tenant cannot attack the title of the landlord. The tenant is not attacking the landlord\u2019s title, it is attacking omissions from the lease which deprived it of what it bargained for.\nAppellant contends that the trial court erred in refusing to allow rental for the months subsequent to the commencement of the action during which time respondent remoyed the stored sand and gravel at the stipulated price. A statement of the facts of the contention is a sufficient answer to it.\nAppellant contends that the trial court erred in refusing to allow it attorney\u2019s fees and costs, which the lease- provided should go to the prevailing party. -Neither party prevailed and, hence, neither is entitled to them.\nWe find no merit in appellant\u2019s assignments of error directed to the findings of the trial court. They are supported by the record.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nHamley, Finley, and Olson, JJ., concur."

    "Schwellenbach, J.\nThis is an appeal from a judgment on the verdict for the defendant in an unlawful detainer action brought to obtain possession of a building leased by-plaintiffs to defendant.\nThe complaint alleged that A. B. Thisius and Martha Thisius, his wife, were the legal owners of a four-story cold storage warehouse located in Yakima; that, in June, 1944, Thisius sold the property under a real-estate contract to Verne Tasker; and that, in December, 1945, Tasker assigned the contract to Tasker-Brackett, Inc., a Washington corporation.\nThat prior to the sale of the property, Thisius, on June 26, 1945, entered into a lease agreement with Torvig Sealander, who has occupied the premises since that time, but willfully and intentionally did violate the terms of the lease and permit waste on the premises, in that he failed to lubricate the cold storage machinery properly and used a poor grade of lubricants, resulting in certain equipment being damaged and destroyed beyond repair; and that he failed and neglected to operate the heating plant properly.\nThat the defendant continuously, willfully, and knowingly overloaded the floor space, causing each floor to sag and thus weaken the building, and three of the floors collapsed as the result of such overloading; that he failed to keep competent engineers, and, in 1945, failed to employ any engineer to maintain the cold storage equipment; that he did not abide by certain ordinances of the city of Yakima as to posting in a conspicuous place in each story of the building the loading capacity of the floor space.\nThat, in March of 1945, Verne Tasker caused to be served upon defendant a notice of forfeiture for his failure to employ a competent engineer to maintain the plant, and that he failed to procure an engineer until the last day allowed in the notice of forfeiture; that thereafter, during the month of November, 1945, Tasker caused another notice of forfeiture to be served upon the defendant, due to his willful and intentional violation of the terms of the lease. The plaintiffs further alleged that they were entitled to possession on December 17th and to damages in twice the amount of the rental, which was five hundred dollars a month, together with damages for the destruction of the floors in the amount of ten thousand dollars, the sum of one thousand dollars for damage to the office space, and five thousand dollars for damage to the cold storage equipment and machinery, the damages asked for totaling sixteen thousand dollars.\nBy answer, the defendant admitted the existence of the corporation, the ownership of the property in Thisius; that a lease agreement had been entered into; that he had been in possession since June 26, 1942; and that a notice of forfeiture had been served upon him. But defendant denied that he had committed waste or had violated any of the terms of the lease. He denied the allegations as to damages for double rent, and also denied that the building had been damaged to the extent of sixteen thousand dollars. Affirmatively, the defendant alleged that, on April 14, 1945, he exercised his option to renew the lease for three years, and that, on July 18, 1945, he paid plaintiffs three thousand dollars as rent up to April 15, 1946; that he performed all the covenants of the renewed lease; that Tasker interfered with his quiet enjoyment under the terms of the lease, requiring him to employ a watchman at $216 a month; and that plaintiffs failed to keep the premises in repair, to his damage in the sum of $1,249.60. These matters were all denied by the plaintiffs.\nThe case was tried to a jury, which rendered a verdict for the defendant. A motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, for a new trial was denied. The plaintiffs appealed.\nThe building was constructed by Thisius in 1935. It is a warehouse, a hundred by a hundred forty feet, consisting of a basement and three stories. He installed a refrigeration plant in the southeast corner of the basement. Sealander leased the premises in 1937 and 1938. The next year, he moved to another location, but went back in 1940. He has been there ever since. On June 26,1942, the lease in question was entered into. The provision for forfeiture therein follows:\n\u201cTime and manner of payment by Lessee of said rent or sum reserved, in payments in advance as herein agreed, and strict performance by the Lessee of the terms, conditions and covenants, expressed or implied in law herein contained, is now agreed to be, and is hereby made, of the strict essence of this lease, and if default shall be made in the payment of rent, or any part thereof, or if default shall be made in any of the covenants, promises, or agreements herein contained to be kept by said Lessee, it shall be lawful for Lessors, at their election to terminate this lease; provided, however, that before such termination and cancellation shall be effective the Lessors shall served upon Lessee, personally, a written notice specifying the particular defaults claimed by said Lessors, and requiring the Lessee in the alternative to remove said defaults within thirty days or to vacate said premises, and it is understood and agreed that said notice of cancellation shall not be effective unless the Lessee shall fail to remove said defaults and comply with the lease and until the expiration of the thirty days from the service of said notice. It is further agreed that the method herein provided for shall be in lieu of the statutory remedies for cancellation of this lease.\u201d\nOn April 14, 1945, Sealander served notice that he was exercising his option to renew the lease for a three-year period. July 17, 1945, he issued a check to Thisius and Tasker, in the amount of three thousand dollars, to cover rent up to April 15, 1946.\nMeanwhile, on July 27, 1944, Thisius executed a contract of sale of the premises to Tasker, subject to the lease to Sealander. The purchase price was sixty thousand dollars, on which a down payment of one thousand dollars was made. The balance was to be paid by assuming a mortgage of twenty-five thousand dollars in favor of Sealander and by paying the remaining thirty-four thousand dollars in the following manner: four thousand dollars on or before September 15, 1944, five thousand dollars at the time of surrender of possession of the premises by Sealander, and five thousand dollars each year thereafter until the entire purchase price is paid.\nThe building was constructed with a reinforced concrete floor in the basement. Some forty odd wooden columns, ten by twelve inches, extend from the basement, through the various floors, to the roof. Each column was set in a concrete pier which extended about eight inches from the floor. One morning in the early part of November, 1945, one of the columns split and the concrete in the supporting pier crumbled on two sides, so that, after the accident, the column was resting on a sort of wedge-shaped support. As a result, the three floors sagged at this point over a distance of approximately twenty-eight feet. The accident occurred in the engine room. Directly above was the office, and over that, on the other two floors, were piled boxes of apples. Emergency braces were put up, removing the immediate danger and restoring the sagging floors to a somewhat nearly normal condition. Two or three days later, the appellants caused to be served on the respondent the second notice of forfeiture. The notice was as to default in the following covenants of the lease: ordinances, repairs, maintenance, engineer, and indemnity. The allegations concerning the various defaults followed the wording of the lease very closely. It was subject to the thirty-day provision quoted above.\nTasker-Brackett was incorporated December 5 or 6, 1945, and, on December 6th, Tasker assigned his interest in the real-estate contract to the corporation.\nMost of the testimony at the trial had to do with the collapse of the floors. Appellants\u2019 witnesses testified that it was due to the overloading of the warehouse with the apples. Respondent\u2019s witnesses stated that it was due to an inferior mix of concrete in the pier supporting the column, which cracked and caused the collapse. His witnesses also claimed that Tasker, being in the storage business, was primarily interested in getting Sealander out so that he could take possession himself. As stated, the jury decided in favor of Sealander.\nThe following are the assignments of error made by appellants: The court erred in refusing to admit evidence under the notice of forfeiture, in confining their evidence to overloading under the notice of forfeiture, in requiring them to prove their case by full, clear, and strict evidence, and in refusing to give their proposed instructions.\nAt the beginning of the trial, the court ruled on the alleged defaults contained in the notice. The questions of proper care and maintenance of the refrigeration equipment and of the employment of a competent engineer, or engineers, were withdrawn from the jury for the reason that the language of the notice was too indefinite and not sufficient to apprise the defendant of the defaults claimed in order to give him an opportunity to correct them within the thirty-day period. The test for such a notice is found in Byrkett v. Gardner, 35 Wash. 668, 77 Pac. 1048, at p. 674:\n\u201cWhen the nature of the case is considered, it is at once apparent that, in so far as the action is founded on the fourth subdivision of the statute quoted, the case turns on the sufficiency of the notice to quit. If the breaches of the conditions of the lease, upon which the lessors rely to work its forfeiture, are recited in the notice in terms too general, or too indefinite and uncertain, to inform the lessee of the acts or omissions constituting the breach, so that he can have no opportunity to correct the acts or supply the omissions, it is plain that no sufficient complaint of unlawful detainer can be founded thereon. The notice cannot be aided by particularity in the complaint. The lessee is given, by the statute, the alternative of complying with the conditions and covenants of the lease, or quitting the premises, and in order to give him the opportunity to exercise his right of choice, the notice must specify with particularity the conditions and covenants which he has failed to keep or perform; a general recital of the conditions and covenants of the lease, followed by the statement that the lessee has failed to keep \u2018each and all\u2019 of such conditions and covenants, cannot be sufficient.\u201d\nWithout overburdening this opinion by detailing the specific allegations contained in the notice of forfeiture, we feel that the court\u2019s ruling, withdrawing the disputed alleged forfeitures from the consideration of the jury, was correct. The main question to be determined was the damage to the building due to the alleged overloading, and this was submitted to the jury. Because there was no evidence of a violation by the defendant of any city ordinance or regulation, that question was withdrawn from the jury also. That ruling was correct.\nThe court dismissed from the case, as parties plaintiff, Thisius and wife. This was an action for possession of real estate. Thisius and wife had contracted to sell to Tasker. They were not entitled to and could not be placed in possession of the premises in the event of a verdict for the appellants.\nThe appellants claim error in the failure of the court to give their proposed instructions Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, and 12. With the exception hereinafter noted, the rights of all parties were fully protected by the instructions given to the jury. We find no error appearing in the trial as to the admission of testimony. However, we are of the opini\u00f3n that a new trial should be granted because of error in giving certain instructions.\nThe trial court gave the following instructions:\nInstruction No. 7: \u201cThe burden is upon the plaintiff to establish, by evidence that is full, clear and strict, the material allegations of its complaint essential to a recovery, and in the event of recovery, the amount thereof.\u201d\nInstruction No. 12: \u201cYou are hereby instructed that the plaintiff in this case is endeavoring to enforce forfeiture of the lease held by the defendant, Torvig Sealander. I hereby instruct you that a forfeiture is not favored and before you can find that the defendant has forfeited his lease you must find by full, clear and strict proof and evidence submitted to you by the plaintiff that the defendant has violated his lease and has failed to remedy such violation within a period of thirty days after specific notice of the violation.\n\u201cOn this point I instruct you that the plaintiff must prove by full, clear and strict proof that the defendant so overloaded said building beyond its proper loading capacity to the point where such overloading, and such overloading alone, caused the floors to sag and the column to split and break. You must further find that the defendant within thirty days after November 16, 1945, the date notice of forfeiture was served upon him, failed to remove such overload from that portion of the building where the breaking of the pier and the sagging of the floor occurred. I further instruct you that if you find that the failure of the foundation or pier caused or contributed to the sagging of the floors or the breaking of the pillar, your verdict must be for the defendant. I hereby instruct you that full, clear and strict proof is that proof which has a greater weight in your mind than the preponderance of the evidence as herein defined.\u201d\nThese instructions were evidently given on the authority of Income Properties Inv. Corp. v. Trefethen, 155 Wash. 493, 284 Pac. 782. In that case, the defendants leased property to the assignor of the plaintiff for four years. The total rental would have amounted to $158,700. The tenant had paid the owner fifteen thousand dollars as consideration for the lease. About a month after the lessee went into possession, it demanded that the lessors make certain repairs according to the terms of the lease. The lessors made part of the repairs, but failed to comply with the demands of the lessee in full. The lessee quit paying rent and notified the lessors that it would offset the same against damages accruing through want of repairs. The lessors served notice to pay rent or quit, and then started an action under the unlawful detainer statute. The lessee then sought to restrain the lessors from prosecuting it so long as the damages for failure to repair were greater than the amount due for rent. After discussing the facts, we said, p. 504:\n\u201cUnder such conditions, a forfeiture would be most inequitable and any action at law available to respondent, inadequate. Under the decree, appellants are not enjoined from maintaining an action for their rent at any time, but are only enjoined from maintaining a particular kind of action which would lead to a forfeiture until such time as they perform their part of the lease contract. In the unlawful detainer action, appellants do not seek to continue their contract and recover their rent, but to enforce a forfeiture; and forfeitures are never favored. Equity always leans against them, and only decrees in their favor when there is full, clear and strict proof of the legal right thereto.\u201d\nIt will be seen in that case that two separate actions were commenced: one, the statutory legal remedy of unlawful detainer, and the other, an equitable action to restrain the enforcement of a legal action until the landlords had complied with the terms of their lease regarding repairs. The two actions were consolidated for trial.\nThere is no question but that equity has a right to step in and prevent the enforcement of a legal right whenever such an enforcement would be inequitable. However, we are concerned here with the degree of proof necessary to establish a case in an unlawful detainer action. When the parties, in the case at bar, entered into their lease agreement, there was in effect Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 812 [P.P.C. \u00a7 55-5], subd. (4):\n\u201cA tenant of real property for a term less than life is guilty of unlawful detainer either,\u2014 . . .\n\u201c(4) When he continues in possession in person or by subtenant after a neglect or failure to keep or perform any other condition or covenant of the lease or agreement under which the property is held, including any covenant not to assign or sublet, than one for the payment of rent, and after notice in writing requiring ... in the alternative the performance of such condition or covenant or the surrender of the property, served (in the manner provided in this act) upon him, and if there be a subtenant in actual possession of the premises, also upon such subtenant, shall remain uncomplied with for ten days after service thereof. Within ten days after the service of such notice the tenant, or any subtenant in actual occupation of the premises, or any mortgagee of the term, or other person interested in its continuance, may perform such condition or covenant and thereby save the lease from such forfeiture; ...\u201d\nThis statute became a part of the lease agreement.\nForfeiture is an incident to the legal remedy granted under the statute. When a landlord establishes in a court of law that his tenant is guilty of unlawful detainer, forfeiture of the tenant\u2019s rights under the lease necessarily follows as an incident thereto. But in order to prove the defendant guilty of unlawful detainer under the statute, the landlord is only required to establish his case by a preponderance of the evidence. He is not required to assume the burden of establishing the material allegations of his complaint by evidence that is full, clear, and strict. That burden is too severe.\nFurthermore, a tenant is entitled to relief from forfeiture even after judgment. Section 830, Rem. Rev. Stat. [P.P.C. \u00a7 55-41], provides:\n\u201cThe court may relieve a tenant against a forfeiture of a lease and restore him to his former estate, as in other cases provided by law, where application for such relief is made within thirty days after the forfeiture is declared by the judgment of the court, as provided in this chapter. The application may be made by a tenant or subtenant, or a mortgagee of the term, or any person interested in the continuance of the term. It must be made upon petition, setting forth the facts upon which the relief is sought, and be verified by the applicant. Notice of the application, with a copy of the petition, must be served on the plaintiff in the judgment, who may appear and contest the application. In no case shall the application be granted except on condition that full payment of rent due, or full, performance of conditions of covenants stipulated, so far as the same is practicable, be first made.\u201d\nAn examination of all the relevant statutes reveals that unlawful detainer is a legal remedy and that all that is required of the plaintiff is to establish his proof by a preponderance of the evidence. Because of error in giving instructions Nos. 7 and 12, the cause is remanded for a new trial.\nMillard, C. J., Robinson, Jeffers, and Mallery, JJ., concur."

    "Millard, J.\nThe Madison Corporation, a domestic corporation, owner of a store building at First avenue and Madison street in Spokane, notified Frank Jenkins, a local real-estate broker, that a portion of the ground floor of the building and the basement were available for renting. No instructions were given to the real-estate broker other than to find a suitable tenant.\nJoseph B. Bates, who was apprised by Jenkins of the opportunity to rent the premises in question, discussed the matter with the officers of the corporation. The parties discussed the question of remodeling and making certain alterations. Bates was informed by the corporation that he would be permitted to remodel and redecorate the interior of that portion of the building rented by him to make it suitable for his use, but that the expense incident to the work must be borne by him. Negotiations culminated in a written lease of the ground floor and basement for a term of five years. The provisions of the lease, pertinent to the question before us, read as follows:\n\u201cLessees shall forthwith remodel the front of said store room so as to make one entrance only. Said front to be remodeled and modernized. The bulk head from side walk to the plate glass to be torn out and re-placed with structural glass or other material to be approved by lessor. The store front when remodeled shall be of modern construction and appearance.\n\u201cAll electrical wiring shall be changed to the effect that all circuits in leased area are to be removed from present light meter and new meter loop established.\n\u201cAll changes for the aforesaid re-modeling and re-wiring to be done at the expense of the lessees.\n\u201cLessor shall furnish all heat and water; lessees to pay for all electricity and gas.\n\u201cLessees shall redecorate and remodel the interior of said store room at their own expense.\u201d\nBates obtained, through Jenkins, a contractor to perform the work of converting the vacant store room into a merchandising establishment. Bates entered into an agreement with A. M. Bengel, that contractor, respecting the improvements the former desired. Jenkins did not participate in the conferences leading up to the agreement. The contractor was informed that he would be paid by, and was working for, Bates. All orders for work done and materials furnished came from Bates. The only authority given to the real-estate broker was to collect the rents from the tenant and withhold therefrom his fees for making the collection. He visited, without instructions from, or knowledge of, the lessor, the premises during the period the interior was remodeled, but he made no report thereon to the lessor, nor did he give any directions or advice to the lessee or contractor concerning the work.\nPursuant to the contract between Bates and the contractor, the latter furnished certain labor and materials to Bates for remodeling and redecorating the interior of the store room, and none was employed in repairing the front of the building. None of the work performed by the contractor had anything to do with electrical wiring or removal of electrical circuits, light meter, or meter loops. Shortly after completion of the work, Bates went into bankruptcy, and the contractor filed a claim of lien for labor performed and materials furnished in redecorating and remodeling the store room, and brought this action against Bates and the corporation to foreclose his lien. An order of default was entered as to defendant Joseph B. Bates, who failed to plead in the action within the time limited by statute. Trial of the cause to the court resulted in dismissal of the action. Contractor Bengel appealed.\nCounsel for appellant contend that the provisions of the lease imposed an obligation upon lessee, Bates, to make such repairs and alterations as were necessary to place the leased premises in a suitable condition for the purpose which the lessee intended to use those premises. It is insisted that, by reason of the mandatory provisions of the lease, the lessee became the agent of respondent, lessor, relative to making improvements, repairs, and alterations to the leased premises; therefore, the feehold interest of respondent, lessor, is subject to the lien for cost of labor and materials therefor.\nA reading of the provisions of the lease quoted above, clearly disclose that the lessee was obligated to alter and remodel the exterior front of the building in a certain, definite manner, to be approved by respondent. It was mandatory upon the lessee to make those repairs, and, if he had done so, respondent would have been obligated, in the event of the lessee\u2019s default, to meet the cost of such improvements.\nThat phase of the. lease, however, is not before us, as the lessee did not remodel or alter the exterior front of the building, nor is there any question presented respecting \u25a0the electrical work, which was performed by another contractor. All the work performed and material furnished by appellant for Bates, was for remodeling and altering the interior of the store room. The agreement in the lease for redecoration and remodeling the interior of the store room, at the expense of the lessee, was permissive. The lessee was under no obligation to redecorate and remodel the interior of the store room and was, therefore, in no sense the agent of respondent, owner. Such work was not for the benefit of respondent, lessor, and no action could have been brought by respondent, lessor, to compel the lessee to remodel the interior of the building.\nIn Stetson-Post Mill Co. v. Brown, 21 Wash. 619, 59 Pac. 507, 75 Am. St. 862, we announced the rule, which we have since consistently followed, that, if the lease does not make it an obligation of the lessee running to the lessor to improve the leased premises, the interest of the lessor may not be charged with liens of those who perform work for the lessee, at his request.\nThe lease did not impose such an obligation upon the lessee as to render him the statutory agent of the respondent.\nTherefore, the judgment is affirmed.\nMallery, C. J., Simpson, Schwellenbach, and Hill, JJ., concur."

    "Jeffers, J.\nThis action was instituted by V. I. Whitney and wife against Hubert S. Hahn, in the superior court for Thurston county, to recover damages in the sum of $825, claimed to have been caused by the removal by defendant of a furnace from a building owned by plaintiffs and rented by defendant on a month to month basis, and also to recover the sum of thirty dollars as rent for the month of April, 1942.\nDefendant, by his answer, denied any and all liability claimed to have been caused by the removal of the heating plant, and any and all liability for rent for the month of April, 1942. Defendant alleged affirmatively that he installed a furnace in the building after the expiration of the written lease under which he had formerly held the property in question, and at a time when he was holding the property under an oral agreement, based on a monthly rental. He further alleged that the furnace was installed for the purpose of assisting him in conducting his business, which was that of painting automobiles, and that the furnace was never intended to become a part of the building, and was no part of the improvements or repairs contemplated by the parties when the original written lease was executed, the terms of which plaintiffs alleged were included-in the agreement relative to the month to month tenancy.\nThe matter came on for hearing before the court, which thereafter made and entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and judgment, favorable to defendant, dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 action.\nThe following facts were entitled to consideration by the court: (We shall hereinafter refer to Mr. Whitney as the sole plaintiff.) On and before June 30,1936, plaintiff was the owner of an old frame building and the lot upon which it was located, in Montesano, Washington. The building had been vacant for two or more years, and was badly in need of repairs. About this time, plaintiff was approached by defendant in regard to renting the property. We quote from plaintiff\u2019s testimony:\n\u201cBut, anyway, when Mr. Hahn approached me to rent the building, it was in pretty much of a rundown condition, and we entered into an agreement whereby he would make the necessary repairs and alterations. In other words, I said, \u2018Go ahead and do whatever you want to to the building.\u2019 He did that. Put in some new foundations and new floors and put it in a pretty presentable condition. ...\u201d\nOn June 30, 1936, plaintiff, by a written instrument, leased the premises to defendant for the term beginr ning July 1, 1936, and ending December 31, 1939. The part of the lease which plaintiff claims was carried over and became a part of the oral agreement, to which we shall later refer, is \u00a7 3, which provides:\n\u201cThe lessee hereby accepts the premises as they are and in the condition that they are now in; all changes, alterations, repairs or improvements desired by the tenant shall be at his own cost and expense The lessee is hereby granted the right to make necessary and convenient changes, alterations or repairs on the said premises at his own cost and expense, and the same shall remain in the building and become a part of the said premises.\u201d (Italics ours.)\nThe rental was twenty dollars a month for the remainder of 1936, and thirty dollars a month thereafter for the balance of the term.\nDefendant took possession of the property, and used it in his business of painting automobiles. There is no question but that defendant expended at least the sum of fourteen hundred dollars in repairing the building and putting it in shape to be used during the term of ,his lease.\nPlaintiff testified that, at about the time the written lease expired, he had a talk with defendant about a new lease, and the result was that they agreed to a lease on a month to month basis, with a five' dollar increase in rental, and\n\u201c. . . with the understanding and under the same arrangement we had with the written lease. He said, T don\u2019t know whether I am going to stay.\u2019 It was uncertain, but he stayed two or three years.\u201d \u25a0.\nDefendant purchased the furnace here in question in November, 1939, for $225, but it was not installed until after the expiration of the written lease. We quote from defendant\u2019s testimony:\n\u201cThe furnace was installed after, approximately a month after the lease had expired, due to the fact I didn\u2019t know what sort of arrangements Mr. Whitney would make me, and I wasn\u2019t going to install something in there and have to tear it out right away, so I waited until after we had made an agreement on a month to month basis. I bought the furnace previous to the time that the lease expired. I did not install it until after the lease had expired, and we had made an agreement whereby it was satisfactory for me to stay there.\u201d\nIn answer to a direct question as to whether or not, when arrangements were made for defendant to continue in possession on a month to month basis, anything was said about improvements or repairs on the property, defendant answered:\n\u201cNo, there was nothing said about any improvements on either side. Q. As a matter of fact, were any made? A. No, sir.\u201d\nThere was no basement in the building, and the furnace was installed on the. main floor, the pipes running to various parts of the building being held up by wires.\nD\u00e9fendant testified that the furnace was used for drying the paint and heating the shop to dry paints and keep the place warm for his employees. While there were some pipes running to the registers in the ceiling, used to some extent in heating the upper floors where defendant lived, he was not able to use these very much because the spray from the paint would go up through the pipes and gather on the furniture.\nWhile there were three holes cut in the ceiling, where the registers were installed, it is evident that this was not a difficult job, and did not injure the building, as the building was not plastered, and putting in the registers required only the removal of a few boards. Defendant installed the furnace himself.\n; There was a fire in' the building in February, 1942, and as a result the building was not in condition to be used for defendant\u2019s business. There was some talk between the parties about repairs, but defendant finally concluded to move out. The understanding was that he was to vacate the building by April 1st, but there is evidence from which it can be reasonably inferred that plaintiff told defendant that if he stayed a few days longer it would not make any difference. Defendant had paid rent to April 1st, and by April 3rd he had removed his effects from the building, including the furnace, but prior to that time had delivered a key to the building to a Mr. Moore, who was plaintiff\u2019s forem\u00e1n.\nThe trial court concluded that defendant had the right to remove the furnace, as the facts surrounding the installation clearly precluded any idea or intention on the part of defendant to leave it in the premises when he removed therefrom; that there was a meeting of the minds as to the termination of the tenancy on March 31, 1942, and the defendant was not hable for any rent thereafter; and that defendant was entitled to judgment dismissing plaintiff\u2019s action.\nOn December 21, 1942, judgment was entered in accordance with the above conclusions of law. Plaintiff moved for judgment notwithstanding the decision of the court, or in the alternative for a new trial. These motions were denied, and plaintiff has appealed from the judgment entered.\nAppellant\u2019s only assignment of error is based on the refusal of the court to hold that under the contract the furnace became part of the premises.\nIt is appellant\u2019s contention that the rights of the parties were fixed by the written lease, the terms of which appellant contends were carried over and became a part of the oral agreement. Appellant specifically relies on that part of the written lease which is hereinbefore set out.\nTo sustain this contention, appellant cites the case of Gasaway v. Thomas, 56 Wash. 77, 105 Pac. 168, in which Judge Rudkin, writing the opinion for the court, quoted from the case of Filley v. Christopher, 39 Wash. 22, 80 Pac. 834, 109 Am. St. 853, as follows:\n\u201c \u2018The true criterion of a fixture is the united application of these requisites: (1) Actual annexation to the realty or something appurtenant thereto; (2) application to the use or purpose to which that part of the realty with which it is connected is appropriated; and (3) the intention of the parties making the annexation to make permanent accession to the freehold.\u2019 \u201d\nAppellant also cites the case of Ballard v. Alaska Theatre Co., 93 Wash. 655, 161 Pac. 478, which holds that, as between landlord and tenant, the presumption is that the tenant did not intend to enrich the freehold by annexing fixtures. We are unable to see where the cited cases are of any assistance to appellant.\nAppellant then cites Siegloch v. Iroquois Mining Co., 106 Wash. 632, 181 Pac. 51, wherein is found the statement that the term \u201cimprovements,\u201d as used in the contract involved in the cited case, has a broader signification than that which is usually accorded to the term \u201cfixtures,\u201d and that the rights of the parties are to be determined by the meaning of \u201cimprovements,\u201d rather than by the meaning of the word \u201cfixtures.\u201d\nAppellant states in his brief:\n\u201cThe contract [written lease] deals expressly with \u2018repairs and improvements,\u2019 not fixtures. Without extensive \u2018repairs and improvements\u2019 the property would not have served the respondent for the purpose for which'he leased it.\u201d\nThe following general statement, found in 22 Am. Jur., p. 749, \u00a7 40, is amply supported by case law:\n\u201cThe element of intention is given especial emphasis in the case of chattels placed on realty by one in possession thereof in the relation of a tenant, and the presumption in such case is that the tenant does not intend to enrich the freehold, but makes such additions for his own -benefit. Furthermore, as between landlord and tenant, in order to favor trade and encourage industry, the greatest latitude is allowed the tenant in removing fixtures. Accordingly, not only do such articles as ordinarily retain their character as chattels remain the property of the tenant, but also some classes of articles which, under other relations, would become a part of the realty, such as those fixtures which have been attached for ornament, for the tenant\u2019s own domestic comfort and convenience, or for trade purposes.\u201d\nIn the instant case, the court found the furnace was installed after the expiration of the written lease, and for the purpose of drying the paint on cars upon which respondent was working. In other words, it was installed -for the main purpose of assisting him in his trade of painting automobiles.\nWe do not find that the courts have attempted to limit the term \u201ctrade fixtures\u201d to any particular equipment. This question is discussed at some length in the case of Wiggins Ferry Co. v. Ohio & M. R. Co., 142 U. S. 396, 35 L. Ed. 1055, 12 S. Ct. 188, wherein reference is made to the case of Van Ness v. Pacard, 2 Pet. (27 U. S.) 137, 7 L. Ed. 374, in which it was held that \u00e1 house built by a tenant upon land primarily for the purpose of a dairy, and incidentally for a dwelling house for the family,\u2019 did not pass with the land. The opinion continues:\n\u201cThe earlier authorities are reviewed in that case by Mr. Justice Story, and the conclusion reached, that whatever is affixed to the land by the lessee for the purpose of trade, whether it be made of brick or wood, is removable at the end of the term. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive that any fixture, however solid, permanent and closely attached to the realty, placed there for the mere purposes of trade, may not be removed at the end of the term.\u201d\nSee our own case of Ballard v. Alaska Theatre Co., supra, where we. stated that, in determining whether a chattel which has been annexed to the freehold is a trade fixture or a part of the realty, the cardinal inquiry is into the intent of the party making the annexation.\nWe are convinced that the judgment entered herein can be sustained either upon the theory that under the facts in this case the furnace was installed as a trade fixture, and as such was removable by respondent at the end of his term, or upon the theory that, conceding that the repairs and improvements referred to in the written lease would include a furnace, the evidence did not establish that the provisions of the written lease became a part of the oral agreement for a month to month tenancy, under which it is admitted respondent was holding at the time he vacated the premises and removed the furnace. There being, then, no express agreement relative ~ to improvements, repairs, or fixtures, it does not seem to us that it would be reasonable to assume that it was the intention of the parties that the furnace was installed as a permanent improvement to the property, when respondent knew that he might be compelled to vacate the premises at any time on a twenty-day notice.\nWe are also of the opinion that under the evidence the trial court correctly held appellant was not entitled to rent for the month of April, 1942.\nFor the reasons herein assigned, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\nSimpson, C. J., Millard, Steinert, and Mallery, JJ., concur."

    "Langenbach, J.\nPee Wee Investments, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as Pee Wee), owned and subdivided a small tract of land north of Seattle. The city of Seattle had a franchise to furnish water to that area. It had an old 4-inch wooden water main on the south side of 185th Street while the Pee Wee property fronted on the north side of that street. The city had a plan to lay an 8-inch line along the north side of said street as a replacement of the 4-inch line. Pee Wee had plans prepared for water service to its addition which had been approved by the city.\nPlaintiff had an oral contract with Pee Wee to install its water system for $2,256. Pee Wee agreed to pay for the pipe and accessories when delivered, and payment for its installation when the work was inspected and approved by the city.\nWork started in June 1963. Pee Wee did not pay for the pipe when delivered as agreed. Nevertheless, plaintiff dug the trench, laid the pipe and accessories, and backfilled the trench, leaving the joints exposed for city inspection, and then quit. He did not dig the trench to connect the new and old water mains. He did not ask the city to pressure-test the pipe or to make an inspection; $50 worth of work remained to finish this particular job.\nPlaintiff completed his work in July 1963, and in August filed a lien when payment was not made. The lien was specifically against \u201c6 dwelling houses situated upon the following described land, to-wit: Lots 1 through 6 of Pee Wee Addition to King County King County, Washington . . . [for] Labor $814.40, material $1450.\u201d Nothing appeared in the lien that the installation of this water main was involved. The wording of the lien would infer that the work and materials were furnished in these houses rather than laying a water main adjacent to these lots.\nPrior to the commencement of this work Pee Wee had deposited $350 with the city to cover costs of connection and inspection of this water main.\nIn February 1964, the work of backfilling was completed by Pee Wee and thereafter pressure tests and inspection were made. After these tests had been approved the new main was attached to the city water system in April 1964. On March 12, 1964, Pee Wee gave the city its bill of sale to the pipe and accessories.\nAfter plaintiff had filed his lien, mortgage holders on the lots liened against foreclosed their prior mortgages so that plaintiff\u2019s lien rights were extinguished. In the meanwhile, Pee Wee officials disappeared and abandoned all interest in the property. During this time the plaintiff was negotiating with these mortgagees in an endeavor to secure payment. When it was discovered that the city claimed title under its bill of sale from Pee Wee, the mortgagees refused to make any payment. Plaintiff then sued the city for taking property without compensation. The city interposed three affirmative defenses: (1) That this was a tort action for conversion and no claim had been filed with the city; (2) that the relation of plaintiff and Pee Wee was that of seller and purchaser and the sales act applied and title passed upon delivery; (These two defenses were rejected by the trial court.) (3) that this was a fixture case. When the pipe was laid it became part of realty, lost its identity and title passed to the city by the Pee Wee bill of sale. This was the basis for the trial court\u2019s decision and is the basis of this appeal.\nTwo claims of error are made: (1) Finding of fact No. 4 which reads as follows:\nThat the oral agreement provided for partial payment when the pipe and other materials were delivered to the site, and full payment when construction of the system was completed; that the agreement did not contain any reservation of title to the watermain in plaintiff until paid, nor is there any other objective evidence of plaintiff\u2019s intention that the watermains and other equipment were to remain personal property; that plaintiff proceeded to install the watermains and other equipment, and substantially completed said work, but was not paid any sum on said contract; that the joints were left uncovered for inspection but plaintiff did not connect the mains to the City\u2019s water system as he had not been paid. (Italics ours.)\nPlaintiff conceded that this was a contract for work and labor, and material furnished, but argued that the work had not been completed nor had he surrendered dominion over the same. He had stopped work because of a failure of payment.\nPlaintiff testified that at the time he constructed the water main it was his intention that it should be connected with the city water main after he had consented to its inspection. Yet there was no agreement that the city water department should make any payment and no claim for payment was filed with the city. During the period of negotiations for payment by the mortgagees he informed the city he had an agreement for settlement so that the city might go ahead and connect the water mains.\nThe work was practically completed, only $50 worth of work remained to be done. This had been done by Pee Wee which delivered its bill of sale to the city. Plaintiff\u2019s lien did not in any way refer to the unfinished water main, but was directed specifically against the six houses in this subdivision. There was nothing of record which would in any manner advise the city of a claim against this pipe and accessories. The evidence showed that the city never paid for such installations which were either paid for by the property owners privately or by way of a local improvement district. After such installations had been inspected and approved by the city title thereto passed to the city. The evidence clearly supported this finding and this claim of error is without any merit.\n(2) The second claim of error attacked conclusion of law No. 3, which reads:\nThat in determining whether or not improvements to land have in legal contemplation become a part of the realty in which they were annexed, the intention of the parties is one of the dominant factors to be considered. That when the watermains and related equipment were annexed to the land by plaintiff pursuant to his contract for work, labor and materials, the personal property involved was intended to be a fixture and a part of the realty of Pee Wee Investments, Inc., and title to said personal property therefore passed to Pee Wee Investments, Inc., upon such annexation, although not paid for.\nThe objection was against that part which stated that when the water main was annexed to the land, the personal property involved was intended to be a fixture and a part of the realty. Plaintiff\u2019s contention was that he had not completed the work and had not authorized inspection, nor had he connected the new pipe to the old. Until he so agreed, he had not abandoned his interest in the pipe which still remained a chattel and his personal property. He testified, however, that during his negotiations with the mortgagees he informed the city officials that he had made a settlement and they should proceed with the test and inspection. In addition, his lien was silent as to the pipe and accessories. The city had neither actual nor constructive notice of any claim on his part to this water main.\nPlaintiff further admitted that when the pipeline had been installed it was intended to pass to the city as an integral part of its water system. Yet, in the contract negotiation and in the course of installation, he did nothing to secure his interest in the pipe and accessories until he obtained payment. Under these circumstances the trial court determined that the pipe had become fixtures and a part of the realty. In support of this position the court cited Murray v. Bender, 125 Fed. 705, 711 (9th Cir. 1903):\nThe absence of a previous agreement . . . that the property was to remain the personal chattel of the party making the annexation is evidence of a legal intention that the property was to be regarded as a fixture, which must prevail over the secret intention that the property was to remain separate and removable.\nThe installation of the pipe and accessories comes within the rule stated in Parrish v. Southwest Washington Prod. Credit Ass\u2019n, 41 Wn.2d 586, 589, 250 P.2d 973 (1952);\nIn Forman v. Columbia Theater Co., 20 Wn. (2d) 685, 148 P. (2d) 951, this court stated that the true rule relative to fixtures was contained in the following language from Filley v. Christopher, 39 Wash. 22, 80 Pac. 834:\n\u201c \u2018The true criterion of a fixture is the united application of these requisites: (1) Actual annexation to the realty, or something appurtenant thereto; (2) application to the use or purpose to which that part of the realty with which it is connected is appropriated; and (3) the intention of the party making the annexation to make a permanent accession to the freehold.\u2019 \u201d\nThe work had been substantially completed by plaintiff; it had been finished by Pee Wee which gave the city its bill of sale. Plaintiff had informed the city to proceed with the inspection and connection. His payment had been expected from either Pee Wee or its mortgagees and never from the city. Consequently, there is no basis, in law or in equity, whereby this became a responsibility or liability of the city. The judgment is affirmed.\nFinley, C. J., Hill, Rosellini, and Hale, JJ., concur.\nJudge Langenbach is serving as a judge pro tempore of the Supreme Court pursuant to Art. 4, \u00a7 2(a) (amendment 38), state constitution."

    "Schwellenbach, J.\nApril 27, 1949, Mon Wai and wife leased certain real property in Yakima to Parks and Watkins for a term of ten years, beginning not later than July 1,1949, at an agreed rental of $405 per month, payable in advance, on or before the first day of each month. The pertinent provisions of the lease agreement are as follows:\n\u201cWhereas, the parties hereto desire to enter into an agreement whereby the parties of the first part will construct upon the above-described premises a parking lot and service station building, the parties jointly sharing the cost of said construction; and\n\u201cWhereas, the parties hereto desire to enter into an agreement for the construction of said property and the leasing of said building and premises; Now, Therefore,\n\u201cIt is agreed and understood that in consideration of the covenants herein contained and the payments of rental hereinafter provided, that the Lessors do hereby agree to construct upon the above-described real property a hard-surface asphalt parking lot to be enclosed by a six-foot cyclone fence \u00bfnd a concrete bumper curb of the full area, except around the entrance and service station. And in addition thereto Lessors will construct a concrete-block building and other installations which are evidenced by blue print attached to this agreement, signed by the parties hereto and made a part hereof by reference.\n\u201cLessees have as of this date delivered to Lessors the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, which Lessees agree shall be applied to the cost of the construction of said parking lot; all the remaining cost and expense thereof shall be borne by Lessors, except that Lessees shall furnish and pay for the cost of installing gasoline tanks, pumps and any and all other facilities as they shall desire upon said premises. . . .\n\u201cIt is agreed and understood that at the termination of this. lease any and all improvements placed upon said premises shall remain thereon and shall be the property of Lessors, except that Lessees shall have the right to remove any gas pumps placed upon said premises and shall have the right to remove any fixtures or equipment together with any stock of goods and supplies placed thereon by Lessees, except the gas tanks, which may be remov\u00e9d without in any way damaging or injuring said premises. . . .\n\u201cIt is agreed and understood that in the event Lessees shall fail, neglect or refuse to pay the rentals herein reserved and in the manner herein set forth, time being declared to be the essence of this agreement; or in the event Lessees shall fail in any other respect to carry out the terms and conditions of this agreement; . . . Lessors shall have the option to forfeit and terminate this lease and recover possession of the premises herein demised in the manner and form provided by the laws of the State of Washington now or hereafter to go into effect, but Lessors shall give thirty (30) days notice in writing of their intention to forfeit said lease, which notice may be made either personally on either of the above-named Lessees, or may be made by depositing the same in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Lessees, or either of them at the above-described premises, and all moneys paid by Lessees to Lessors shall be forfeited as liquidated damages to Lessors.\n\u201cThe above remedies in the case of the failure, to pay rent or to perform the covenants of this contract are cumulative and shall not deprive Lessees of the right to use any statutory remedies available to them. . . .\n\u201cIn the event suit or action is instituted to enforce any of the terms or conditions of this agreement, or to regain possession of the same or any part thereof, the prevailing party in such suit or action shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to be determined by the court.- . . . \u201d (Italics ours.)\nThe lessees took possession July 1,1949.\nJuly 22, 1949, Parks sold his interest to Watkins. By the terms of a written instrument executed by the parties, Watkins assumed and agreed to pay, and in all particulars to perform, the rentals, terms and conditions of the Mon Wai lease.\nWatkins continued in possession and paid the rentals up to September 1,1951. However, he did not pay the rentals due September 1, 1951, October 1, 1951, and November 1, 1951.\nNovember 5, 1951, Mon Wai served notice on Parks and Watkins that they had failed to make the three payments above mentioned, in the total amount of $1,215, and notified them that unless the payments were brought to date within thirty days the lease would be forfeited and terminated.\nNovember 7, 1951, Parks and Watkins surrendered the property to Mon Wai, and delivered possession and the keys to him.\nMarch 7, 1952, Mon Wai and wife commenced this action against Parks and Watkins for the unpaid rent. Parks answered, setting up the agreement between himself and Watkins and praying that, in the event judgment be entered against him, he have and recover judgment over against Watkins in the full amount, together with an attorney\u2019s fee of $150. Watkins answered, alleging that the lease was terminated and rescinded prior to the institution of the action and that there was no valid and binding agreement in existence at that time.\nThe trial court entered judgment against Parks and Watkins, and each of them, in the amount of $1,215, plus interest and costs, and an attorney\u2019s fee of $250. The court also, as part of the same judgment, awarded judgment in the amount of $1,465 to Parks over and against Watkins, together with an attorney\u2019s fee of $150. Watkins alone is appealing.\nAppellant assigns error in the making of certain findings of fact; in awarding judgment against Parks and Watkins; in awarding judgment over to Parks; and in allowing attorney\u2019s fees to Parks.\nUnless there is a stipulation in the lease agreement providing for liquidated damages in case of default, upon forfeiture of a lease for failure to pay rent the lessor may recover all rent due at the time the forfeiture was declared. Kelley v. von Herberg, 184 Wash. 165, 50 P. (2d) 23.\nWe have held that, where a certain sum is paid to the lessor by the lessee to be held until the end of the term, and it is agreed between the parties that, either in the event of nonpayment of rent payable at the times specified or of default of any of the covenants contained in the lease, the lessor may cancel the lease and the sum paid to the lessor shall be forfeited as liquidated damages, such agreement is binding provided the amount agreed upon as liquidated damages is reasonable. Smith v. Lambert Transfer Co., 109 Wash. 529, 187 Pac. 362; Pacific & Puget Sound Bottling Co. v. Clithero, 162 Wash. 156, 298 Pac. 316; Benjamin Franklin Thrift Stores v. Jared, 192 Wash. 252, 73 P. (2d) 525.\nThere is no difference, so far as damages are .concerned, between a breach of a covenant to pay rent and a breach of any other covenant in the lease. In Pacific & Puget Sound Bottling Co. v. Clithero, supra, we said:\n\u201cThe first paragraph of the lease above quoted provides that in consideration of the sum of two thousand dollars and the performance of the other covenants by the lessee, the premises are leased and demised.- In the last paragraph quoted, the two thousand dollars first m\u00e9ntioned is specifically referred to as having been deposited as liquidated damages. It is there said that the two thousand dollars so deposited shall be forfeited as liquidated damages on account of the \u2018breach or default\u2019 of the lessee. The question then arises whether the breach and default there referred to includes a breach or default in the covenant to pay rent.\n\u201cThe clause in the fore part of the sentence, \u2018if the rent shall be due and unpaid,\u2019 bears exactly the same relation to the latter part of the sentence covering liquidated damages on account of breach or default as does the clause, \u2018 (if) default shall be made in any of the conditions or. covenants herein contained.\u2019 If the liquidated damages specified covers one clause, it would seem to necessarily follow that it covers the other. While it is true that the two thousand dollars, when first mentioned in the lease, was referred to as a consideration therefor, its status as liquidated damages was definitely fixed in the last paragraph.\u201d\nEven though no money has been deposited, if the parties to a contract stipulate that, in the event of a breach, one of the parties shall pay to the other a specific sum as stipulated damages, such an agreement is valid, the theory being that the parties have agreed, or have stipulated, as to the amount of damage. Herberger v. Orr Co., 62 Wash. 526, 114 Pac. 178. In each instance, the intention of the parties is controlling. 52 C.J.S. 213, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 472 b.\n2 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, 2023 (3rd Rev.), defines liquidated damages:\n\u201cDamages the amount of which has been determined by anticipatory agreement between the parties.\n\u201cDamages for a specific sum stipulated or agreed upon as part of a contract, as the amount to be paid to a party who alleges and proves a breach of it.\u201d\nIt will thus be seen that, where liquidated damages are provided for, a particular amount has been agreed upon between the parties to be paid in case of a breach. Ordinarily in lease agreements the lessee has paid a certain sum to the lessor, and that particular sum is earmarked as the amount to be retained in the event of a default by the lessee. However, in executory contracts for the sale of real property, it is often provided that, in case of default, the seller may forfeit the contract and retain, as liquidated damages, all sums theretofore paid by the purchaser.\nCounsel have not furnished us, nor has our search revealed, a case such as this, wherein the lease agreement provided, \u201cand all moneys paid by Lessees to Lessors shall be forfeited as liquidated damages to Lessors.\u201d Appellant insists that the above clause must have referred to the $5,000 paid at the time of the execution of the lease. We are satisfied that the $5,000 was the lessees\u2019 contribution to the cost of the construction of the parking lot, the cost of which was to be shared jointly by the parties.\nAlthough, as stated above, we have found no case holding that \u201call moneys paid by Lessees shall be forfeited as liquidated damages,\u201d we see no reason why the parties may not so contract if they desire to do so. When the parties to this lease agreement contracted, the lessees contributed $5,000 as their share of the cost of the construction of the parking lot. At the expiration of the term, which was to run ten years, the improvements would belong to the lessor. No testimony was given as to the intention of the parties, and that intention must be gained from the language which they themselves used.\nIt could very well be that the parties, realizing that the lessees were contributing $5,000 toward the construction of a service station which they were to occupy for ten years and which would then belong to the lessor, considered the fact that at some time during the term of the lease (here it was two and one-half years), lessees might default, thus giving the lessor the right to terminate the lease. It would be a fair interpretation of the agreement that the parties stipulated that, in such an event, considering the fact that the time of the full ownership of the property in the lessor would thus be accelerated, the only damages to which the l\u00e9ssor would be entitled because of the default of the lessees, would be the moneys which they had already paid to him.\nCounsel for respondents stated, in oral argument at the Departmental hearing, that the liquidated damage provision was merely \u201cthrown in\u201d in order to be overly cautious. At the En Banc hearing he stated that the including of that provision was inadvertent and was therefore superfluous. Nevertheless, it is there, and respondents are bound by it. It should be noted that the provisions in the lease concerning forfeiture and liquidated damages are both included in one paragraph, consisting of one sentence. There is no question but that the lease was drawn by respondents\u2019 counsel. Where a lease is capable of more than one construction, the courts will adopt that construction most favorable to the lessee. Anderson v. Ferguson, 17 Wn. (2d) 262, 135 P. (2d) 302, and cases cited. See, also, Dorsey v. Strand, 21 Wn. (2d) 217, 150 P. (2d) 702.\nWe are of the opinion that the parties, by agreement, limited respondents\u2019 damages, in case of their termination of the lease and recovery of possession because of the failure of the lessees to pay the rentals when due, to the moneys theretofore paid by lessees to respondents.\nParks is not appealing the judgment against him. Subsequent to the entry of the judgment, and after Watkins\u2019 appeal had been commenced, respondents executed on sufficient of Parks\u2019 property to cover the full amount of the judgment, plus interest, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees. They then satisfied of record the judgment against Parks and Watkins. Respondents move this court to dismiss the appeal because the question is now moot, relying upon National School Studios v. Superior School Photo Service, 40 Wn. (2d) 263, 242 P. (2d) 756; Pacific Savings & Loan Ass\u2019n v. Smith, 121 Wash. 595, 209 Pac. 1086, 212 Pac. 582; Lewis-Pacific Dairymen\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Frame, 126 Wash. 493, 218 Pac. 385. Those cases are not in point as to the issues now before us. Neither is RCW 4.88.040, relied upon by respondent. The motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.\nThe judgment appealed from is reversed.\nMallery, Hamley, Donworth, and Finley, JJ., concur."
