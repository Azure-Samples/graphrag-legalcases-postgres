        "content": "Based on the provided context, the case does not specifically address water leaking into an apartment from the floor above. Therefore, there is no specific legal precedent mentioned in the context for this particular problem.\n\nHowever, the case does discuss the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which is a legal principle that allows for the inference of negligence when an accident occurs under certain circumstances. The court in this case explained the requirements for the application of res ipsa loquitur, stating that exclusive control of the offending instrumentality must be established by the evidence.\n\nTo find specific legal precedents in Washington on the problem of water leaking into an apartment from the floor above, you may need to conduct further research and consult legal resources such as case law databases, legal textbooks, or consult with a legal professional familiar with Washington state laws.",
