        "content": "The prominent legal precedents from cases in Washington regarding water leaking into an apartment from the floor above include:\n\n1. **O'Brien v. Detty**:\n   - **Issue**: Whether a landlord is liable for injuries resulting from a defective condition (water leak) if they were notified and failed to remedy the defect within a reasonable time.\n   - **Legal Principle**: Under the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973, RCW 59.18, landlords are required to maintain a dwelling in reasonably weathertight condition. The landlord must have timely notice of the defect and must repair it within a reasonable time (RCW 59.18.060(8); RCW 59.18.070). Negligence may be established if the landlord fails to act within this time frame.\n   - **Outcome**: The case emphasizes the landlordâ€™s obligation to address defects in a timely manner after being notified by the tenant.\n\n2. **Puget Sound Service Corp. v. Dalarna Management Corp.**:\n   - **Issue**: Whether a seller (landlord) is liable for non-disclosure of extensive water leakage issues.\n   - **Legal Principle**: Constructive fraud by nondisclosure applies when the seller knows of a defect and fails to disclose it, and the defect is not apparent or readily ascertainable to the buyer. \n   - **Outcome**: The court held that buyers have a duty to inquire about known problems if there is evidence of water penetration, and sellers may be liable if they fail to disclose significant defects not readily apparent.\n\nThese cases provide a framework for understanding the responsibilities of landlords in Washington regarding water leaks and the importance of timely repairs and disclosures.",
