    "New Meadows Holding Co. v. Washington Water Power Co.",
    "Dolliver, J.\nPlaintiff Mark Brown, while attempting to light an oil stove on December 31, 1978, unwittingly ignited natural gas which was leaking from a damaged gas line several blocks away. The natural gas, unable to permeate the frozen ground, traveled laterally entering the drain field which serviced Brown's residence. The leak allegedly was caused 7 years earlier when Cable Way, Inc. (Cable Way), while laying underground telephone cable for Pacific Northwest Bell (PNB), damaged a 2-inch gas transmission line owned by Washington Water Power Company (WWP). The subsequent explosion seriously injured Brown and destroyed the residence he rented from New Meadows Holding Company (New Meadows).\nPlaintiff New Meadows sued WWP, PNB, and Cable Way. WWP answered and sought indemnity by cross claim from PNB and Cable Way. PNB brought separate summary judgment motions for dismissal against New Meadows and WWP asserting the claim and cross claim were barred by the statutes of limitation in RCW 4.16.300-.320. New Meadows failed to appear and did not contest the motion. WWP appeared and resisted the motion. Both motions for dismissal were granted. New Meadows and WWP appealed.\nSubsequently, Brown and New Meadows sued WWP alleging liability based upon negligence and strict liability. They then filed a motion for summary judgment against WWP on the issue of strict liability. This motion was granted.\nCourt of Appeals, Division Three, granted discretionary review of the summary judgment order holding WWP strictly liable. This case and the appeals of New Meadows and WWP from the orders dismissing their actions against PNB were placed on a parallel perfection schedule and decided in a single opinion.\nIn New Meadows Holding Co. v. Washington Water Power Co., 34 Wn. App. 25, 659 P.2d 1113 (1983), Division Three held RCW 4.16.300-.320 did not apply to claims for damages to adjacent property and therefore reversed PNB's summary judgment on WWP's cross claim. The court, however, affirmed PNB's summary judgment against New Meadows, finding its failure to contest the motion amounted to waiver. Additionally, the court held the transmission of natural gas through underground lines was not an abnormally dangerous activity. Therefore, the summary judgment against WWP on the issue of strict liability was reversed. Plaintiffs' petition for discretionary review was granted.\nI\nInitially, we must determine whether the failure of New Meadows to contest PNB's motion for summary judgment waived its right to appeal. Failure to raise an issue before the trial court generally precludes a party from raising it on appeal. Smith v. Shannon, 100 Wn.2d 26, 37, 666 P.2d 351 (1983). This rule affords the trial court an opportunity to rule correctly upon a matter before it can be presented on appeal. Lake Air, Inc. v. Duffy, 42 Wn.2d 478, 482, 256 P.2d 301 (1953). However, this rule does not apply when the question raised affects the right to maintain the action. Maynard Inv. Co. v. McCann, 77 Wn.2d 616, 621, 465 P.2d 657 (1970).\nSince to deem New Meadows' failure to appear as a waiver affects its right to maintain the action, New Meadows' claim falls squarely under the exception to the general rule. Moreover, the trial court was not deprived of an opportunity to rule on the applicability of RCW 4.16.300-.320 to this case. PNB's motions for summary judgment, based on these statutory provisions, were adequately briefed and argued by PNB and WWP. New Meadows and WWP had identical interests. Thus, New Meadows' argument was not raised for the first time on appeal. We reverse the lower court's summary judgment dismissal of New Meadows' claim.\nII\nNext, at issue is whether New Meadows' claim and WWP's cross claim against PNB are barred by RCW 4.16-.300-320. RCW 4.16.300-.320 apply to all claims or causes of action arising from construction, alteration, or repair of any improvement upon real property. RCW 4.16.310 states such claims\nshall accrue, and the applicable statute of limitation shall begin to run only during the period within six years after substantial completion of construction . . . Any cause of action which has not accrued within six years . . . shall be barred: Provided, That this limitation shall not be asserted as a defense by any owner, tenant or other person in possession and control of the improvement at the time such cause of action accrues.\nThe Court of Appeals, relying on Vern J. Oja & Assocs. v. Washington Park Towers, Inc., 89 Wn.2d 72, 569 P.2d 1141 (1977), held the statute did not apply to claims for damages to adjacent property. We disagree. Oja held, under the 3-year statute of limitation in RCW 4.16.080(1), the discovery rule determines when a cause of action accrues in cases involving damage to real property arising out of construction on adjacent property.\nThis holding has no impact on the absolute limitation on actions defined in RCW 4.16.310. Gazija v. Nicholas Jems Co., 86 Wn.2d 215, 222 n.2, 543 P.2d 338 (1975); Hudesman v. Meriwether Leachman Assocs., Inc., 35 Wn. App. 318, 320-23, 666 P.2d 937 (1983). This statute begins to run upon substantial completion of a project, not upon the accrual of a claim. In fact, the statute runs against the accrual of any claim arising from the project. Consequently, for a claim to be heard, it must accrue within 6 years. Additionally, RCW 4.16.310 applies to all claims of causes of action arising from the activities covered. The focus is upon the cause of the damage, not its location. We conclude, therefore, the statute applies equally to claims arising from adjacent property.\nThe proviso of RCW 4.16.310, however, which prohibits an owner, tenant, or other person in possession and control of the improvement from asserting the limitation as a defense, removes PNB from the terms of the statute. PNB, as owner of the telephone cable, falls within the proviso. The claims of New Meadows and WWP are not barred by RCW 4.16.300-.320.\nIll\nWashington, as well as all other jurisdictions in the United States, applies a negligence standard to the underground piping of gas. See Richey & Gilbert Co. v. Northwestern Natural Gas Corp., 16 Wn.2d 631, 134 P.2d 444 (1943); Senske v. Washington Gas & Elec. Co., 165 Wash. 1, 4 P.2d 523 (1931); Annot., Liability of Gas Company for Personal Injury or Property Damage Caused by Gas Escaping From Mains in Street, 96 A.L.R.2d 1007 (1964 & Supp. 1983). Plaintiffs urge us to reexamine this doctrine and adopt the rule that the transmission of natural gas through underground lines is an abnormally dangerous activity upon which strict liability should be imposed.\nStrict liability is imposed when the conditions of Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 519, 520 (1977) are met. Pacific Northwest Bell Tel. Co. v. Port of Seattle, 80 Wn.2d 59, 64, 491 P.2d 1037 (1971) (holding underground water mains do not constitute an abnormal condition warranting strict liability). Section 519 provides for the imposition of strict liability upon those who are carrying on an \"abnormally dangerous activity\". Whether an activity is abnormally dangerous is a question of law for the court to decide. Langan v. Valicopters, Inc., 88 Wn.2d 855, 861, 567 P.2d 218 (1977).\nSection 520 lists the factors to be considered when determining what constitutes an abnormally dangerous activity:\n(a) existence of a high degree of risk of some harm to the person, land or chattels of others;\n(b) likelihood that the harm that results from it will be great;\n(c) inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care;\n(d) extent to which the activity is not a matter of common usage;\n(e) inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried on; and\n(f) extent to which its value to the community is outweighed by its dangerous attributes.\nAn examination of these factors as they apply to the facts persuades us, as it did the Court of Appeals, that strict liability should not be imposed in this case.\nIt is conceded with regard to factors (a) and (b), that the volatile and highly explosive nature of natural gas potentially presents a high degree of risk of great harm. The invisibility of natural gas increases the risk of injury in that it decreases the likelihood escaping gas will be detected. As to factor (c), the phrase \"the risk\" plainly refers to the \"high degree of risk\" mentioned in factor (a). Thus, factor (c) addresses itself to the question of whether, through the exercise of ordinary care, the risk inherent in an activity can be reduced to the point where it can no longer be characterized as a \"high degree of risk\".\nSome degree of risk of natural gas pipeline leaks will always be present. This does not mean, however, that the \"high degree of risk\" with which section 520 is concerned cannot be eliminated by the use of reasonable care with regard to the dangerous character of the commodity. See, e.g., Fields v. Western Ky. Gas Co., 478 S.W.2d 20, 22-23 (Ky. 1972); Bubrick v. Northern Ill. Gas Co., 130 Ill. App. 2d 99, 107-08, 264 N.E.2d 560 (1970). Gas companies are subject to strict federal and state safety regulations. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 717, 719; 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1671-1686; 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 192 (1983); WAC 480-93. Programs for corrosion control, pipeline testing, gas leak investigation, and awareness of construction work near gas company facilities must be maintained. WAC 480-93-110, -170, -185, -190. Odorizers are placed in the gas itself to increase the likelihood of detection in those rare instances when natural gas does escape. In light of all this, we believe the high degree of risk involved in the transmission of natural gas through underground lines can be eliminated by the use of reasonable care and legislative safeguards.\nFactors (d), (e), and (f) clearly weigh against imposition of strict liability. The underground transmission of gas is a matter of common usage which is appropriate to the place where it is carried on. In their brief, amici curiae on behalf of the American Gas Association estimate approximately 160 million people use gas for residential needs. About 35 percent of the total energy used by industry is provided by natural gas, United States Dep't of Energy Information Admin., Monthly Energy Review 23 (December 18, 1981); and 720,900 miles of distribution pipelines crisscross communities in every state and the District of Columbia, including 10,062 miles in Washington state. American Gas Ass'n, Gas Facts, 1982 Data 61, 63 (1983). Hence, it is entirely appropriate and necessary for communities to have gas lines placed underground.\nNew Meadows relies upon Siegler v. Kuhlman, 81 Wn.2d 448, 502 P.2d 1181 (1972), cert. denied, 411 U.S. 983 (1973) (strict liability imposed on hauling gasoline in commercial quantities as freight upon public highways). Siegler, however, is easily distinguishable. The court in Siegler stated:\nStored in commercial quantities, gasoline has been recognized to be a substance of such dangerous characteristics that it invites a rule of strict liability \u2014 even where the hazard is contamination to underground water supply and not its more dangerous properties such as its explosiveness and flammability. It is even more appropriate, therefore, to apply this principle to the more highly hazardous act of transporting it as freight upon the freeways and public thoroughfares.\n(Citation omitted.) Siegler, at 457. The underground transmission of natural gas presents a significant contrast to the activity at issue in Siegler. Natural gas flows through a small (2-inch) pipe which is buried underground, away from the dangers of the surface world. There are no careless drivers, faulty brakes, or slippery roads with which to contend. The heightened danger resulting from the storage of a highly volatile substance in large commercial quantities, rolling at high speed on a well traveled highway, is also absent.\nFurthermore, where there is the intervention of an \"outside force beyond the control of the manufacturer, the owner, or the operator of the vehicle hauling [the gasoline]\", the rule of strict liability should not apply. Siegler, at 460 (Rosellini, J., concurring). Here, the gas leak was allegedly caused when a contractor laying underground telephone cable for Pacific Northwest Bell damaged a 2-inch gas transmission line owned by defendant. Neither in its facts nor in its law does Siegler apply to this case.\nWe affirm the holding of the Court of Appeals that the transmission of natural gas through underground lines is not an \"abnormally dangerous activity\" upon which strict liability should be imposed, and reverse New Meadows' summary judgment against Washington Water Power on that issue. The case is remanded for trial on the issue of whether Washington Water Power exercised a degree of care commensurate to the danger involved in transmitting natural gas.\nUtter, Brachtenbach, and Dimmick, JJ., and Morgan, J.

Section 520 states:\nIn determining whether an activity is abnormally dangerous, the following factors are to be considered:\n(a) existence of a high degree of risk of some harm to the person, land or chattels of others;\n(b) likelihood that the harm that results from it will be great;\n(c) inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care;\n(d) extent to which the activity is not a matter of common usage;\n(e) inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried on; and\n(f) extent to which its value to the community is outweighed by its dangerous attributes.\nComment f to section 520 states that all six factors should be considered; while it is not necessary that all elements be present, ordinarily several are required for strict liability.\nHere, the majority opinion acknowledges that the first two elements are present; natural gas creates a high degree of risk, and there is a likelihood of great harm should gas escape from gas lines. The majority holds, however, that the final four elements of section 520 are missing, and therefore strict liability should not be applied. The majority's analysis misapplies the Restatement section by ignoring the similarity between transportation of gasoline on the highway and the transport of natural gas, and rejects sound policy reasons for applying strict liability to the facts of this case.\nTo begin with, the majority misapplies section 520 of the Restatement by concluding that factor (c), the inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care, does not apply to the transport of natural gas. I believe it does.\nThe transmission of natural gas is analogous to the transportation of gasoline. Natural gas, like gasoline, remains relatively safe if contained in its proper place, i.e., gas lines, storage tanks or even automobiles. Once natural gas or gasoline escapes, however, the exercise of ordinary or even extraordinary care frequently is incapable of averting an explosion. See Siegler v. Kuhlman, supra. In Siegler, we found this factor weighed heavily in favor of imposing strict liability. In the same way, the hazards associated with escaped natural gas demand imposition of strict liability.\nThe majority ignores this similarity by observing that the transport of natural gas involves no negligent drivers, slippery roads or faulty brakes. This distinction neglects the risks that may occur, such as negligent excavators, faulty digging equipment or vandals who may remove or damage warning signs.\nMoreover, unlike the majority here, the court in Siegler did not feel compelled to slavishly total the number of factors in favor of imposition against those that did not. Instead, the court recognized the extreme hazard involved with the handling of this product and concluded sound policy dictated imposition of strict liability. In the same way, sound policy considerations dictate imposition of strict liability here.\nFirst, principles of risk allocation support the premise that between two innocent parties, the one benefiting from an activity should bear the risk of loss. Having received a benefit, that party is then in a position to spread the risk of loss to consumers of the products.\nFurthermore, where the abnormally dangerous activity involves high risk of explosions, the one engaged in that activity has a better opportunity to determine the cause of the incident and can therefore seek indemnification. The injured plaintiff can prove negligence as to a third party only with great difficulty.\nFinally, the imposition of strict liability here will spur the natural gas companies to greater safety precautions, such as periodic inspections and supervision of excavating activities within the vicinity of their lines.\nFor these reasons and those discussed above, I believe strict liability should be imposed. I therefore dissent.\nWilliams, C.J., and Dore, J., concur with Rosellini, J.",

    "O'Brien v. Detty",
    "Roe, J.\nPlaintiff was a tenant in a house owned by defendant Detty. (Martin Detty will be referred to, in this opinion, as the sole defendant.) During a long rain, water leaked in around a window, and some collected on the floor. Plaintiff immediately reported this to the defendant and requested that it be repaired. The defendant-landlord twice, within a week of being notified, attempted but failed to locate and remedy the problem. About 2 weeks after giving notice of this condition, the plaintiff slipped in some water and sustained the injuries of which she complains in this action. About 2 weeks after her fall; the defendant succeeded in finding and repairing the leak. The case was tried to a jury, which returned a verdict for the defendant.\nThe Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973, RCW 59.18, modified the common law so as to require decent, safe and sanitary housing. RCW 59.18.040(4). It also requires a landlord to maintain a dwelling unit in reasonably weathertight condition. RCW 59.18.060(8). The sole issue is: Was the statute violated by the mere existence of a prohibited defect in the rented premises, or does the statute instead give a landlord a reasonable time to effect repairs? Plaintiff argues that the defendant violated these sections of the act by allowing the defect to exist, and that such a violation is negligence per se. She thus claims the right to recover for any injuries resulting from the violation.\nSpecifically, the plaintiff assigns as error that part of the court's instruction No. 11 which stated:\nBefore the landlord can be held to have violated this st\u00e1tute, he must know or in the exercise of reasonable care should know of the existence of a condition which does not conform to the statutory requirements. It is for you to determine whether such a condition existed. After notice of such condition, the landlord has a reasonable time in which to effect repairs.\nThe trial court apparently instructed on the principles expressed in Franklin v. Fischer, 34 Wn.2d 342, 348, 208 P.2d 902 (1949):\nUnder the general rules of law applicable to such situations, a lessee, before any damages can be recovered from a lessor for breach of a covenant to keep in repair, would have to establish timely notice to the lessor of the need for repairs, and that the lessor failed to make them within a reasonable time under the circumstances. The rule is well stated by Judge Hay in Asheim v. Fahey, 170 Ore. 330, 133 P. (2d) 246, 145 A. L. R. 861, in these words:\n\" In the absence of a special agreement to make repairs upon the demised premises, a landlord is under no duty to do so. 32 Am. Jur., Landlord and Tenant, section 705. He may, of course, by the terms of his lease, covenant to make repairs, but the law in that connection is that he must have timely notice of the need for repairs before he is obliged to make them. If, after such notice and a reasonable opportunity to make the repairs, the landlord fails to do so, and damage to the tenant or his invitees results, the landlord may be held liable. Ashman v. Nichols, 92 Or. 223, 234, 180 P. 510 [(1919)]; Teel v. Steinbach Estate, 135 Or. 501, 504, 296 P. 1069 [(1931)].\nThe statute essentially adds such a covenant to repair, on the part of the landlord, to most residential rental agreements.\nROW 59.18.070 states that \"reasonable time for the landlord to commence remedial action\", after notice, is not more than 30 days in all cases, except for certain enumerated emergencies not applicable here. The published version of the act contained this provision during the trial and appeal. However, after the appeal was perfected, our Supreme Court in Washington Ass'n of Apartment Ass'ns, Inc. v. Evans, 88 Wn.2d 563, 564 P.2d 788 (1977), restored to the act certain provisions which the Governor had ostensibly, but invalidly, vetoed.\nOne vetoed provision was the last paragraph of RCW 59.18.070, which provides that where there are circumstances beyond a landlord's control, he shall endeavor to remedy a defective condition with all reasonable speed. In holding that veto invalid, the court stated that that vetoed portion had taken away an excuse from timely compliance which otherwise would have been available to the landlord, Washington Ass'n of Apartment Ass'ns, Inc. v. Evans, supra at 567.\nEvidence presented at trial by the defendant indicated that he promptly investigated the trouble, but had difficulty determining the cause. The jury could have found that he endeavored to remedy the condition with all reasonable speed. We believe, since the statute gives a landlord such leeway, that no violation arises until a reasonable time has passed. The notice and time provisions in the statute negative the idea that a landlord is absolutely liable for any defects, which would be a far departure from common law. A landlord's present position and duties are no different than those of a landlord who covenants to repair, as set out in Franklin v. Fischer, supra. There was no error in the trial court's instruction.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nMunson, C.J., and Green, J., concur.\nReconsideration denied April 18, 1978.\nReview denied by Supreme Court October 6, 1978.",

    "Ott, J.\nOctober 30,1954, the Washington Building Company leased \u201cthat certain store space known as 1025 Pacific Avenue,\u201d in Tacoma, Washington, to Donald H. Hutch-ins for an ice cream and soda fountain business. November 30, 1955, the lease was assigned to Arthur A. Riebli and George Hoertrich, Jr., with the consent of the building company. During the weekend prior to October 29, 1956, a water pipe imbedded in the cementlike floor of the leased premises ruptured. Monday morning at 7:30 a. m., the maintenance superintendent of the building company discovered that the basement of the building had been flooded. The flow of water from the ruptured pipe was shut off by a valve which controlled the service of water to the leased premises. The water caused damage to some doors stored by the building company in a basement storeroom, to merchandise stored by the Washington Camera Mart in its basement storeroom, and to a rug on the floor in the basement safe-deposit vault lobby of the United Mutual Savings Bank.\nThe Washington Camera Mart brought suit against Riebli and Hoertrich to recover for its loss. The bank sued Riebli, Hoertrich, and the building company. The building company cross-complained against Riebli and Hoertrich for damages to its doors and for indemnity for any damages it might be required to pay to the bank. The causes were consolidated for trial.\nThe court entered judgment for both plaintiffs and also entered judgment for the building company on its cross-complaint. Riebli and Hoertrich have appealed.\nThe evidence disclosed, inter alia, (1) that the respondents\u2019 premises were damaged by water; (2) that the water came from a ruptured pipe imbedded in the cementlike floor of the premises leased by the appellants; (3) that the pipe was installed in 1947, with the consent of the building company, by a former tenant when he remodeled the premises, and had since remained untouched; (4) that water was supplied by the building company to the appellants\u2019 premises through a system of pipes which it maintained and over which it retained control, the water being piped to a reservoir on the top floor of the building and from there to the various parts of the building; (5) that the appellants were not assignees of Fox, who had installed the pipe, but were in possession as the assignees of the Hutchins lease, and (6) that the lease provided that the tenants had the duty to keep the leased premises in repair and, under certain conditions, to save the building company harmless from occupational liability.\nThe court predicated appellants\u2019 liability to the Washington Camera Mart and to the bank upon the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. The court erred in applying the doctrine to the facts of this case.\nBefore the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur can be applied, exclusive control of the offending instrumentality by the appellants must be established by the evidence. In this regard, Prosser on Torts (2d ed.) 204, \u00a7 42, states the rule as follows:\n\u201cIt is never enough for the plaintiff to prove merely that he has been injured by the negligence of someone unidentified. Even though there is beyond all possible doubt negligence in the air, it is still necessary to bring it home to the defendant. On this too the plaintiff has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence; and in any case where it is clear that it is at least equally probable that the negligence was that of another, the court must instruct the jury that the plaintiff has not proved his case. . . .\n\u201cThis element usually is stated as meaning that the defendant must be in \u2018exclusive control\u2019 of the instrumentality which has caused the accident. . . .\n\u201c. . . It would be far better, and much confusion would be avoided, if the idea of \u2018control\u2019 were discarded altogether, and we were to say merely that the apparent cause of the accident must be such that the defendant would be responsible for any negligence connected with it.\u201d\nIn Morner v. Union Pac. R. Co., 31 Wn. (2d) 282, 294, 196 P. (2d) 744 (1948), this court said:\n\u201c . . . one of the elements essential to the invocation of that doctrine [res ipsa loquitur] is that the party charged with actionable negligence must have sole and exclusive control of the agency or instrumentality which actually caused the injury. If there is no such exclusive control, or if the injury was caused, or may reasonably be said to have been caused, by the concurrent acts of two or more persons or agencies functioning independently of each other, the doctrine does not apply.\u201d\nAccord, 1 Shearman and Redfield, Negligence (Rev. ed.) 153, \u00a7 56; 65 C. J. S. 1014 et seq., \u00a7 220 (8).\nIn Hogland v. Klein, 49 Wn. (2d) 216, 298 P. (2d) 1099 (1956), we recognized that the requirement of control does not mean actual physical control, but refers to legal control or responsibility for the proper and efficient functioning of the instrumentality that caused the injury.\nUnder the facts of this case, was the offending pipe under the exclusive control of the appellants?\nRespondents rely upon Kind v. Seattle, 50 Wn. (2d) 485, 312 P. (2d) 811 (1957). In the cited case, a water main was held to be under the \u201cexclusive control\u201d of the city, when it was installed by the city, maintained by the city up to and at the time of the accident, and the water was supplied by the city. See, also, Klise v. Seattle, 52 Wn. (2d) 412, 325 P. (2d) 888 (1958).\nIn the instant case, the appellants did not install the offending pipe. They did not select the kind or quality of pipe used. They had no control over the water supply. The evidence failed to establish the element of \u201cexclusive control,\u201d which is a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\nFurther, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is based in part upon the theory that negligence will be presumed because the defendant either knew of the cause of the accident, or had the best opportunity of ascertaining the cause and, therefore, should be required to produce evidence in explanation. Shay v. Parkhurst, 38 Wn. (2d) 341, 229 P. (2d) 510 (1951); Morner v. Union Pac. R. Co., supra; Lynch v. Ninemire Packing Co., 63 Wash. 423, 115 Pac. 838 (1911).\nIn this case, there was no proof that the appellants had prior knowledge of the cause of the accident or that they had the best opportunity to know of it. When they took possession of the premises, the imbedded pipe was in place and had remained there untouched during their occupancy.\nThere remains the question of whether the judgment in favor of the Washington Building Company and against the appellants can be sustained because of the following provisions of the lease:\n\u201cThe Parties Hereto Further Agree, As Follows: . . .\n\u201c(2) Throughout the term of this lease, the Lessee will take good care of the demised premises and appurtenances, alterations and improvements, and will keep same in good repair, and at or before the end of the term will repair all injury done by the installation or removal of equipment and fixtures, it being understood that the Lessee shall have the right to remove equipment and fixtures; and, at the end of the term, the Lessee will quit and surrender the demised premises, with all alterations and improvements, in good order and condition, reasonable wear and damage by the elements excepted. . . .\n\u201c(6) The Lessor shall not be liable for damage caused the Lessee by bursting or leaking of any water, gas, or steam pipe by accident or by neglect of other tenants or occupants of the building or their employees. . . .\n\u201c (8) The Lessor shall have the right to enter the premises at reasonable times and intervals to examine the same or to make repairs or alterations. . . .\n\u201c(11) The Lessee agrees to use the leased premises as a careful and prudent person would use his own, and upon the expiration of the term to surrender the premises to the Lessor in as good condition as at the beginning of the term of this lease, save for wear and tear from reasonable and careful use. . . .\n\u201c (14) The Lessee shall keep, save and hold harmless the Lessor from any and all damages and liability for anything and everything whatsoever arising from, or out of the occupancy by, or under, the Lessee, the Lessee\u2019s agents or servants, and from any loss or damage arising from any fault or negligence by the Lessee, or any failure on the Lessee\u2019s part to comply with any of the covenants, terms and conditions herein contained, or otherwise, or whether it be caused by, or be due to, the failure of the Lessee to perform any of the covenants herein, expressed or implied, that are to be performed by the Lessee.\u201d\nRespondents rely upon \u00a7 14, supra. Liability under that section of the lease arises upon (1) appellants\u2019 failure to comply with the terms of the lease, and (2) damages arising from or out of appellants\u2019 occupancy of the premises.\nAs to (1), it was not shown that appellants failed to comply with the terms of the lease. Regarding (2), we are of the opinion that, construing the contract as a whole, the parties intended that the appellants were obligated to \u201ctake good care\u201d of the leased premises during their occupancy, and to make a reasonable and careful use thereof. They were liable only for damage caused by unreasonable and careless use of the premises. The imbedded pipe in some manner ruptured during the appellants\u2019 occupancy. The fact of the rupture alone does not establish that the use of the premises by the appellants was unreasonable or careless. The burden of proving that the water damage was caused by appellants\u2019 failure to comply with the terms and covenants of the lease, or by their unreasonable use of the premises, was not met by the respondents.\nNor does the covenant (\u00a72, supra) which placed upon the appellants the duty to repair make them insurers of latent defects in the premises. The covenant to repair carries with it no more than the duty to repair known defects or defects which could have been discovered by the exercise of due care. Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co., 79 Wash. 643, 140 Pac. 909 (1914); Bernhard v. Reeves, 6 Wash. 424, 33 Pac. 873 (1893).\nThere is no evidence in the record before us that the defect was known to the appellants or that appellants, by the exercise of due care, could have discovered it. The proof established nothing more than a latent defect for which appellants assumed no contractual liability.\nFinally, respondents contend that the offending pipe was a trade fixture. Assuming, arguendo, that the pipe, at the time it was installed by the then tenant, Fox, was a trade fixture and so regarded by Fox and the owner of the building, it lost its identity as a trade fixture and became part of the building when it was leased by the owner as a part of the over-all premises to the appellants\u2019 assignor, Hutchins.\n\u201c \u2018The true criterion of a fixture is the united application of these requisites: (1) Actual annexation to the realty, or something appurtenant thereto; (2) application to the use or purpose to which that part of the realty with which it is connected is appropriated; and (3) the intention of the party making the annexation to make a permanent accession to the freehold.\u2019 \u201d Forman v. Columbia Theater Co., 20 Wn. (2d) 685, 695, 148 P. (2d) 951 (1944), quoting with approval from Filley v. Christopher, 39 Wash. 22, 80 Pac. 834 (1905).\nApplying these tests to the facts in the instant case, the pipe was securely imbedded in the concretelike floor, and was applied to the use of these premises as an ice cream parlor and soda fountain. The actual intention of Fox, who made the annexation, does not appear, but, from the above and from the fact that he did not remove it at the termination of his lease, we must presume that his intention was to make the pipe a permanent annexation to the freehold. Under these facts, it is clear that the pipe became a permanent part of the building company\u2019s water supply system and was leased as a part of the freehold to appellants\u2019 assignor.\nFor the reasons stated, the judgments are reversed, and the causes remanded with instructions to enter judgments dismissing the complaints and the cross-complaint.\nWeaver, C.

            "text": "Hunter, J.\n(dissenting)\u2014A more detailed statement of the facts is necessary to better understand the reasoning of this dissent.\nThe record discloses that the appellant lessees, in the conduct of their business, maintained and operated a motor-driven compressor as a part of their refrigeration equipment situated within the premises, which compressor required a constant supply of water for cooling purposes; that the lessees, in the conduct of their business, obtained water from the Building Company for various uses on their premises, for which they paid a monthly flat fee to the lessor; that they obtained their water supply by means of an entrance pipe through the floor of their premises, connected to the general building water supply system.\nThe testimony in the record, which the trial court was entitled to believe, discloses that immediately inside appellants\u2019 premises on the entrance pipe was a hand-operated control valve by which the flow of water beyond that point could be turned off and on; that from that point on water was distributed to the various points of use within appellants\u2019 premises by plumbing installed by previous tenants; that in order to supply cold water to the appellants\u2019 refrigeration compressor, a pipe, connected with the other plumbing within the premises, was placed under the surface of the floor of their premises; that the floor was laid by a prior tenant; that the flow of water in the pipe was controlled by the same valve within the premises that controlled the flow through the rest of the plumbing; that one of the appellants, George Hoertrich, Jr., was the electrical contractor for the tenant who installed the floor and pipe, and did the electrical work incident to the installation of the compressor, which was the same compressor situated on the premises maintained and operated by the appellants, when the accident occurred on October 29,1956. The record further shows that the pipe was installed on the floor of the premises by being laid upon or partially recessed therein, and was covered with a one' to two-inch terrazzo floor, which is a type of floor laid similar to concrete with the same hardening characteristics; that the original floor was of twelve-inch reinforced concrete, and beneath this floor there is an area of approximately two feet followed by a false ceiling suspended over respondents\u2019 premises. The space between the false ceiling and the concrete floor contains various utilities for the building. In its determination of the source of the escaping water, the trial court found that it resulted from a rupture in the pipeline in the terrazzo floor.\nIn view of the result of this dissent, it is necessary to discuss certain contentions of the appellants in addition to those considered by the majority. Hence, for continuity, all of the appellants\u2019 contentions will be discussed in order, without reference to the majority opinion.\nAppellants contend first, that the evidence is insufficient to support the court\u2019s finding that the instrumentality causing the damage was from a rupture of the pipe in the floor of appellants\u2019 premises. I disagree. The building superintendent testified that the water was running through the ceiling directly beneath the appellants\u2019 premises when the damage was discovered; that there was no other plumbing in that area except the appellants\u2019 plumbing; and that he immediately notified the appellants. The record shows that the appellants thereupon called a plumber who shut off the water at the valve through which the water flows into the appellants\u2019 plumbing from the line of the building supplying the water to appellants\u2019 premises. The water leakage promptly subsided. The plumber bypassed the pipe in the floor, which went to the appellants\u2019 compressor, with copper tubing to carry the water and there was no further difficulty encountered. The building superintendent further testified that, based on his years of experience in maintenance and plumbing work, he believed the break could be caused by a chemical reaction between the galvanizing of the pipe and the concrete floor.\nConsidering the testimony in its entirety and the inferences to be drawn therefrom, there is sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the instrumentality causing the damage was a ruptured pipe in the floor of appellants\u2019 premises.\nThe appellants further contend the trial court erred in finding that the appellants had exclusive possession and control of the premises and the instrumentality causing the damage. The appellants contend the control was in the lessor. I believe an examination of the record discloses the contrary. The lease expressly provides:\n\u201cThroughout the term of this lease, the lessee will take good care of the demised premises and appurtenances, alterations and improvements, and will keep the same in good repair, . . . and, at the end of the term, the lessee will quit and surrender the demised premises, with all alterations and improvements, in good order and condition, reasonable wear and damage by the elements excepted.\u201d (Italics mine.)\nThe court found, as supported by the record, that the ruptured pipe was a part of the plumbing used exclusively in the operation of the appellants\u2019 business. The pipe could be used for that purpose only, and was not in any manner related to the use of the remainder of the building. The ruptured pipe was clearly a part of, and appurtenant to the use of, the demised premises, which the appellants were bound to maintain and repair under the lease and over which they necessarily had control under these circumstances. The appellants argue, however, that they did not have exclusive control since they could not disturb the terrazzo floor without permission of the lessor, on the theory that it would constitute an alteration requiring the consent of the lessor, as provided in the lease. I disagree. The lease must be read in its entirety. The disturbing of the floor would only be an incident to the appellants\u2019 obligation to repair the pipe and would not be an alteration, since the restoration of the floor would be required under the provision of the lease providing for the surrender of the premises in good order and condition at the end of the term (reasonable wear and damage by the elements excepted).\nThe appellants further contend that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is not applicable in this case. The doctrine was recently considered by this court in the case of Klise v. Seattle, 52 Wn. (2d) 412, 325 P. (2d) 888 (1958). There we stated:\n\u201cUnder our recent decision in Kind v. Seattle, 50 Wn. (2d) 485, 312 P. (2d) 811, the rule is:\n\u201c Where a plaintiff\u2019s evidence establishes that an instrumentality under the exclusive control of the defendants caused an injurious occurrence, which ordinarily does not happen if those in control of the instrumentality use ordinary care, there is an inference, permissible from the occurrence itself, that it was caused by the defendant\u2019s want of care. Nopson v. Wockner, 40 Wn. (2d) 645, 245 P. (2d) 1022. Legal control or responsibility for the proper and efficient functioning of the instrumentality which caused the injury and a superior, if not exclusive, position for knowing or obtaining knowledge of the facts which caused the injury, provide a sufficient basis for the application of the doctrine. Hogland v. Klein, 49 Wn. (2d) 216, 298 P. (2d) 1099. When these circumstances are shown, the plaintiff has made a prima facie case, and it devolves upon the defendant to produce evidence to meet and offset the effect of the presumption. Hogland v. Klein, supra.\u2019 \u201d (Italics mine.)\nIn the instant case, finding of fact No. 9 reads as follows:\n\u201cThat the Defendants, Arthur Riebli and George Hoertrich, Jr., had exclusive possession and control of the premises and the instrumentality causing said damage, and that the cause of said occurrence has not been satisfactorily explained, nor have said Defendants shown that they exercised due care to prevent the happening of the occurrence or excused themselves for their failure to do so.\u201d\nThe above finding, which is supported by the record, shows that (1) the appellants had exclusive control of the instrumentality causing the damage; (2) that no showing was made by the appellants of their exercise of due care to prevent the occurrence causing the damage; and (3) that no explanation has been made by the appellants to excuse them from failing to exercise due care in the control and operation of the instrumentality causing the damage.\nUnder the facts in the instant case, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, as stated in the Klise case, supra, applies. The appellants have failed to produce evidence to offset the effect of the presumption of the appellants\u2019 want of due care and they should therefore be liable for the damage incurred.\nThe appellants contend the court erred in awarding judgment for damages to the building on the Building Company\u2019s cross-complaint against the appellants, and in awarding the Building Company a judgment against the appellants for any damages it may sustain as a result of the judgment obtained by the Bank against the Building Company and the appellants. I do not agree. The covenant under the lease expressly provides the lessees will hold the lessor harmless from any and all damages occurring to the lessor whatsoever, as a result of the lessees\u2019 use and occupancy of the premises. The lease states:\n\u201cThe lessee shall keep, save and hold harmless the lessor from any and all damages and liability for anything and everything whatsoever arising from, or out of, the occupancy by, or under, the lessee, the lessee\u2019s agents or servants, and from any loss or damage arising from any fault or negligence by the lessee, or any failure on the lessee\u2019s part to comply with any of the covenants, terms and conditions herein contained, or otherwise, or whether it be caused by, or be due to, the failure of the lessee to perform any of the covenants herein, expressed or implied, that are to be performed by the lessee.\u201d\nThe damage sustained by the Building Company, as alleged in the cross-complaint, and resulting from the judgment obtained by the Bank against the Building Company and the appellants, was a direct result of the lessees\u2019 use and occupancy of its premises, and the court was therefore correct in its ruling.\nThe appellants contend the court erred in awarding damages to the Washington Camera Mart for the loss of anticipated profits from the Christmas business of that year. The trial court was justified in finding that, as a result of the damage occurring on October 29,1956, there was insufficient time for any of the stock of damaged merchandise to be replaced. The finding of lost profits was properly supported by the record, showing that the Camera Mart had been in operation since 1946, and that the Christmas seasons of 1955 and 1956 were comparable as far as general Christmas buisness was concerned.\nFinding no error in the record, the trial court should be affirmed.\nMallery and Rosellini, JJ., concur with Hunter, J.",

    "Tucker v. Hayford",
    "Sweeney, J.\nWe again note that a claim for personal injuries by a tenant can be premised on three distinct legal theories: contract (a rental agreement), common law obligations imposed on a landlord, and the Washington Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973 (Landlord-Tenant Act), chapter 59.18 RCW. In Dexheimer v. CDS, Inc. we concluded that the remedies available to a tenant under the Landlord-Tenant Act were limited to those outlined in the statute. We were wrong.\nHere, the tenants claim that they became sick from drinking contaminated well water provided as part of their tenancy. The trial judge dismissed all of their causes of action \u2014 contract, Landlord-Tenant Act, and common law\u2014 concluding that the Landlord-Tenant Act limited all rights to those specifically enumerated in the act. We conclude that the tenants\u2019 showing on summary judgment is sufficient to support causes of action based on contract, the Landlord-Tenant Act, and the common law. We therefore reverse the summary dismissal of their claims.\nFACTS\nRobert Hayford bought a lot and mobile home in Kennewick, Washington from Mike Kirby in 1994. A domestic well supplied water to the home.\nThe well water was tested on December 8, 1993. On March 15, 1994, the Benton-Franklin District Health Department wrote to Mr. Kirby that: (1) the nitrate level of the well water was 8.8 mg/L (milligrams per liter), (2) the well was free of bacterial contamination, (3) the sanitary seal was improperly installed and maintained, and (4) chemicals were stored within 100 feet of the well. And \u201cto protect and improve\u201d the water system, the health department recommended that: (1) the sanitary seal be properly installed and (2) the chemicals be stored at least 100 feet from the well. The health department also recommended that the well be tested yearly:\nThe Benton-Franklin District Health Department recommends that all wells be tested at least once a year for bacteriological quality and nitrates be tested every three years. The preceding information should be useful to you in evaluating the needs of your water system. A pamphlet on water quality has been enclosed for your information.\nClerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 181.\nMr. Hayford \u201cthumbed through\u201d the report but depended on his real estate agent to call any problems to his attention. CP at 185. And the agent apparently did not.\nMr. Hayford leased the home to Don Tucker and Shalee Miller (now Tucker) in October of 1998. Mr. and Ms. Tucker asked if the well water was drinkable. Mr. Hayford said it was as long as a \u201cBrita\u201d filter was used. He said that the nitrates were a bit high.\nThe Tuckers have four children; one was born after they moved out of the home. The Tuckers signed a written residential lease prepared by Mr. Hayford. They ultimately extended the tenancy through August 1, 2000. The Tucker family all became ill. The family\u2019s pediatric nurse practitioner suggested that they test their well water. The test, dated March 28, 2000, showed bacteria in the water. The Tuckers told Mr. Hayford. He had the well repaired and that solved the problem.\nThe Tuckers moved out of the home on May 15, 2000. They sued Mr. Hayford for damages for personal injury arising from contaminated water. Mr. Hayford moved for summary judgment. The trial court concluded that the landlord\u2019s legal obligations were ultimately governed by the Landlord-Tenant Act. And, relying on our decision in Dexheimer, the judge concluded that the Tuckers were not entitled to personal injury damages under the act. He also concluded that Mr. Hayford had no notice of any defect. And he dismissed the Tuckers\u2019 complaint.\nDISCUSSION\nThe Tuckers sued for damages based on their contract (obligation to perform major maintenance and repair, and covenant of quiet enjoyment); violation of the Landlord-Tenant Act; and negligent misrepresentation as to the water quality. We evaluate the viability of each claim.\nStandard of Review\nThis is an appeal from summary judgment. So we engage in the same inquiry as the trial court. Mountain Park Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. Tydings, 125 Wn.2d 337, 341, 883 P.2d 1383 (1994). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions,. . . [and] affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d CR 56(c). \u201cA material fact is one upon which the outcome of the litigation depends.\u201d Clements v. Travelers Indem. Co., 121 Wn.2d 243, 249, 850 P.2d 1298 (1993). And we consider the facts and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Mountain Park, 125 Wn.2d at 341. The burden is on the moving party to prove no genuine issue of material fact exists. Jacobsen v. State, 89 Wn.2d 104, 108, 569 P.2d 1152 (1977).\nContract Claims\nObligations Imposed by This Contract. Brown v. Hauge spells out the contract exception to the general rule of nonliability:\nThe tenant may recover for personal injuries caused by the landlord\u2019s breach of a repair covenant only if the unrepaired defect created an unreasonable risk of harm to the tenant. The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 357 (1965) provides that the lessor of land is liable if (a) the lessor has contracted to keep the land in repair; (b) the disrepair creates an unreasonable risk that performance of the lessor\u2019s agreement would have prevented; and (c) the lessor fails to exercise reasonable care in performing the agreement.\nBrown v. Hauge, 105 Wn. App. 800, 804, 21 P.3d 716 (2001) (citation omitted). The contract defines the extent of the duty when a landlord\u2019s duty arises out of a covenant. Id.\nBoth the trial court and Mr. Hayford, here on appeal, rely on our decision in Brown for the proposition that the landlord must have notice of the \u201cdefect\u201d before he is subject to liability. Mr. Hayford argues, and the trial court agreed, that Brown is a general statement of the law on notice. We do not read our decision in Brown so broadly.\nIn Brown the landlord had notice of the tenant\u2019s problem (a high door sill). The holding in Brown turned on the nature of the claimed defect, not notice. The contract required the landlord to keep the common areas \u201creasonably clean and safe from defects increasing the hazards of fire or accident.\u201d Id. So, the court reasoned, the landlord was obligated to do something about the door sill only if it was unsafe. All agreed the door sill was inconvenient for the tenants, but nobody \u2014 not the landlord, the tenants, nor a state agent who inspected the premises for a residential adult care facility license \u2014 considered it unsafe. Id. at 802-03, 805. The court ultimately held that the landlord would not be liable under the contract\u2019s safety provision because the door sill was not then unreasonably unsafe. Id. at 805.\nBrown did rely on Teglo v. Porter. Id. at 804. Teglo in turn adopted portions of the Restatement of Torts which are relevant to the claims here:\n\u201cThe lessor\u2019s duty to repair ... is not contractual but is a tort duty based on the fact that the contract gives the lessor ability to make the repairs and control over them. . . . Unless the contract stipulates that the lessor shall inspect the premises to ascertain the need of repairs, a contract to keep the interior in safe condition subjects the lessor to liability if, but only if, reasonable care is not exercised after the lessee has given him notice of the need of repairs.\u201d\nTeglo v. Porter, 65 Wn.2d 772, 774-75, 399 P.2d 519 (1965) (emphasis added) (quoting Restatement of Torts \u00a7 357 cmt. a (1934)).\nNotice then under this provision of the Restatement becomes an issue when the particular condition under consideration is inside the residence where the landlord has no right to enter. But that is not the case here. The source of water here was an outside well, which the landlord had physical access to. Actual notice is not then required.\nHere the lease includes (1) an express covenant of quiet enjoyment and (2) requires that the lessor maintain and repair the leased premises.\nSo the factual question is the usual threshold question where the claim has been dismissed on motion \u2014 whether the condition of this well interfered with their quiet enjoyment of the home, or whether the well required \u201cmajor maintenance\u201d as spelled out in the lease agreement.\nQuiet Enjoyment. No Washington case directly addresses the impact of drinking water on one\u2019s quiet enjoyment of his home. Washington does, however, recognize the relationship of water and habitability. In State ex rel. Andersen v. Superior Court, the court held that without water, a property is uninhabitable. State ex rel. Andersen v. Superior Court, 119 Wash. 406, 407-08, 205 P. 1051 (1922). And in Mitchell v. Straith, the court held that a water system that used an \u201cunusual\u201d approach, but did not affect the water quality, did not render the property uninhabitable. Mitchell v. Straith, 40 Wn. App. 405, 412, 698 P.2d 609 (1985). And in Mathes v. Adams, as the Tuckers point out, the Montana court ultimately held that unsafe drinking water renders a rental property uninhabitable. Mathes v. Adams, 254 Mont. 347, 353, 838 P.2d 390 (1992).\nOther jurisdictions have also held that a property without potable water is uninhabitable.\nIt is well settled that unsafe drinking water renders a home uninhabitable. And that by definition interferes with the quiet enjoyment of the home. The Tuckers have made out an actionable claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment if we look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the Tuckers.\nMajor Maintenance and Repair. A health inspector recommended that this well be tested at least annually for bacteria. The question then is whether a reasonable person knew or in the exercise of ordinary care should have known that this well should have been tested annually \u2014 as part of the major maintenance of this home. Again, the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the Tuckers, includes high nitrate levels together with a recommendation for yearly bacteria testing. That is a sufficient showing to support a breach of the major maintenance and repair covenant of this lease, if proved.\nDuties at Common Law\nTraditional Common Law Landlord Liability. Common law landlord liability requires a showing: \u201c \u2018(1) latent or hidden defects in the leasehold (2) that existed at the commencement of the leasehold (3) of which the landlord had actual knowledge (4) and of which the landlord failed to inform the tenant.\u2019 \u201d Frobig v. Gordon, 124 Wn.2d 732, 735, 881 P.2d 226 (1994) (quoting Younger v. United States, 662 F.2d 580, 582 (9th Cir. 1981)). The landlord need not discover obscure defects or dangers, nor does the law impose any duty to repair defective conditions. Aspon v. Loomis, 62 Wn. App. 818, 826-27, 816 P.2d 751 (1991). A \u201clandlord is liable only for failing to inform the tenant of known dangers which are not likely to be discovered by the tenant.\u201d Id. at 827.\nThe Tuckers moved into this home in 1998. The well was last tested in 1993. It was not tested again until after the Tuckers tested it in 2000. But this was after the Tuckers got sick. It had not then been tested for the five years prior to the Tuckers\u2019 moving in despite a recommendation by the health department that it be tested annually. This well was not then maintained at the time the property was leased to the Tuckers. And the condition of the water was certainly hidden or latent as to the Tuckers. Mr. Hayford did not warn the Tuckers. Mr. Hayford was aware of the report that required the annual testing. The Tuckers have then raised an issue of fact \u2014 whether Mr. Hayford knew or should have known of this latent defect.\nA \u201cshould have known\u201d standard is enough since we have eased the strict requirement of actual knowledge. It is sufficient that the landlord knew or should have been able to identify a defect unknown to the tenant at the time of the initial tenancy. Taylor v. Stimson, 52 Wn.2d 278, 280-81, 324 P.2d 1070 (1958); see also Johnson v. Dye, 131 Wash. 637, 230 P. 625 (1924) (basing liability on constructive knowledge where landlord would have discovered the defect if he had made the repairs he was supposed to make near the defect).\nImplied Warranty of Habitability.\nA landlord is subject to liability for physical harm caused to the tenant and others upon the leased property with the consent of the tenant or his subtenant by a dangerous condition existing before or arising after the tenant has taken possession, if he has failed to exercise reasonable care to repair the condition and the existence of the condition is in violation of:\n(1) an implied duty of habitability, or\n(2) a duty created by a statute or administrative regulation.\nRestatement (Second) of Property \u00a7 17.6 (1977) (emphasis added).\nWe adopted this section of the Restatement in Lian v. Stalick. There, we recognized a cause of action for the implied warranty of habitability under the Landlord-Tenant Act according to subpart (1) of the Restatement section 17.6. Lian v. Stalick, 106 Wn. App. 811, 822, 25 P.3d 467 (2001).\nLian then supports the Tuckers\u2019 cause of action under subpart (1) of section 17.6 of the Restatement.\nResidential Landlord-Tenant Act\nThe Tuckers next argue that contrary to our holding in Dexheimer v. CDS, Inc., the Landlord-Tenant Act allows a remedy for personal injury damages.\nThe Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (Uniform Landlord-Tenant Act) was drafted by the National Conference of Commissions on Uniform State Laws in 1972. 5 Thompson on Real Property \u00a7 43.05(b), at 385 (David A. Thomas ed., 1994). While Washington made \u201csubstantial changes\u201d to the Uniform Landlord-Tenant Act when it adopted its own Landlord-Tenant Act, our state\u2019s version still reflects a \u201cstrong [Uniform Landlord-Tenant Act] influence.\u201d Id. at 385 & n.649.\nThe Uniform Landlord-Tenant Act abandoned the \u201cconveyance\u201d aspect of landlord/tenant law as unsuitable for modern times in favor of \u201can interdependent, or contract, view of lease covenants.\u201d Id. at 386 (citing Uniform Landlord-Tenant Act \u00a7 1.102 cmt.). The purpose of the Uniform Landlord-Tenant Act was twofold: \u201c \u2018simplify, clarify, modernize and revise\u2019 \u201d landlord and tenant law, and to \u201c \u2018encourage landlords to maintain and improve the quality of housing.\u2019 \u201d Id. (emphasis added) (quoting Uniform Landlord-Tenant Act \u00a7 1.102).\nWashington\u2019s Landlord-Tenant Act. The Landlord-Tenant Act requires the landlord to \u201ckeep the premises fit for human habitation\u201d and to particularly maintain the premises in substantial compliance with health or safety codes for the benefit of the tenant. RCW 59.18.060(1). It requires the landlord to make repairs, except in the case of normal wear and tear, \u201cnecessary to put and keep the premises in as good condition as it by law or rental agreement should have been, at the commencement of the tenancy.\u201d RCW 59.18.060(5).\nIt lists the landlord\u2019s obligations. RCW 59.18.060. And it lists the tenant\u2019s remedies: (1) terminate the rental agreement; (2) \u201c[b]ring an action in an appropriate court, or at arbitration if so agreed, for any remedy provided under this chapter or otherwise provided by law;\u201d or (3) pursue the other remedies available under the Landlord-Tenant Act. RCW 59.18.090 (emphasis added).\nDexheimer. In. Dexheimer, we rejected a tenant\u2019s claim for tort damages following breach of the Landlord-Tenant Act. We concluded that the tenant\u2019s remedies for the landlord\u2019s breach of RCW 59.18.060 were limited to only those remedies specifically set forth in our Landlord-Tenant Act. Dexheimer v. CDS, Inc., 104 Wn. App. 464, 471,17 P.3d 641 (2001). Other jurisdictions allow a tenant\u2019s cause of action arising from statutory duties under their versions of the Uniform Landlord-Tenant Act. And Washington commentators appear to agree. We conclude that the Washington Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973 provides a cause of action for the injury sustained here.\nCONCLUSION\nWe reverse the trial court\u2019s summary judgment order.\nThe remainder of this opinion has no precedential value. Therefore, it will be filed for public record in accordance with the rules governing unpublished opinions. RCW 2.06.040.\nKato, A.C.J., and Kurtz, J., concur.\n104 Wn.

            "text": "Sweeney, J.\nWe again note that a claim for personal injuries by a tenant can be premised on three distinct legal theories: contract (a rental agreement), common law obligations imposed on a landlord, and the Washington Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973 (Landlord-Tenant Act), chapter 59.18 RCW. In Dexheimer v. CDS, Inc. we concluded that the remedies available to a tenant under the Landlord-Tenant Act were limited to those outlined in the statute. We were wrong.\nHere, the tenants claim that they became sick from drinking contaminated well water provided as part of their tenancy. The trial judge dismissed all of their causes of action \u2014 contract, Landlord-Tenant Act, and common law\u2014 concluding that the Landlord-Tenant Act limited all rights to those specifically enumerated in the act. We conclude that the tenants\u2019 showing on summary judgment is sufficient to support causes of action based on contract, the Landlord-Tenant Act, and the common law. We therefore reverse the summary dismissal of their claims.\nFACTS\nRobert Hayford bought a lot and mobile home in Kennewick, Washington from Mike Kirby in 1994. A domestic well supplied water to the home.\nThe well water was tested on December 8, 1993. On March 15, 1994, the Benton-Franklin District Health Department wrote to Mr. Kirby that: (1) the nitrate level of the well water was 8.8 mg/L (milligrams per liter), (2) the well was free of bacterial contamination, (3) the sanitary seal was improperly installed and maintained, and (4) chemicals were stored within 100 feet of the well. And \u201cto protect and improve\u201d the water system, the health department recommended that: (1) the sanitary seal be properly installed and (2) the chemicals be stored at least 100 feet from the well. The health department also recommended that the well be tested yearly:\nThe Benton-Franklin District Health Department recommends that all wells be tested at least once a year for bacteriological quality and nitrates be tested every three years. The preceding information should be useful to you in evaluating the needs of your water system. A pamphlet on water quality has been enclosed for your information.\nClerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 181.\nMr. Hayford \u201cthumbed through\u201d the report but depended on his real estate agent to call any problems to his attention. CP at 185. And the agent apparently did not.\nMr. Hayford leased the home to Don Tucker and Shalee Miller (now Tucker) in October of 1998. Mr. and Ms. Tucker asked if the well water was drinkable. Mr. Hayford said it was as long as a \u201cBrita\u201d filter was used. He said that the nitrates were a bit high.\nThe Tuckers have four children; one was born after they moved out of the home. The Tuckers signed a written residential lease prepared by Mr. Hayford. They ultimately extended the tenancy through August 1, 2000. The Tucker family all became ill. The family\u2019s pediatric nurse practitioner suggested that they test their well water. The test, dated March 28, 2000, showed bacteria in the water. The Tuckers told Mr. Hayford. He had the well repaired and that solved the problem.\nThe Tuckers moved out of the home on May 15, 2000. They sued Mr. Hayford for damages for personal injury arising from contaminated water. Mr. Hayford moved for summary judgment. The trial court concluded that the landlord\u2019s legal obligations were ultimately governed by the Landlord-Tenant Act. And, relying on our decision in Dexheimer, the judge concluded that the Tuckers were not entitled to personal injury damages under the act. He also concluded that Mr. Hayford had no notice of any defect. And he dismissed the Tuckers\u2019 complaint.\nDISCUSSION\nThe Tuckers sued for damages based on their contract (obligation to perform major maintenance and repair, and covenant of quiet enjoyment); violation of the Landlord-Tenant Act; and negligent misrepresentation as to the water quality. We evaluate the viability of each claim.\nStandard of Review\nThis is an appeal from summary judgment. So we engage in the same inquiry as the trial court. Mountain Park Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. Tydings, 125 Wn.2d 337, 341, 883 P.2d 1383 (1994). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions,. . . [and] affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d CR 56(c). \u201cA material fact is one upon which the outcome of the litigation depends.\u201d Clements v. Travelers Indem. Co., 121 Wn.2d 243, 249, 850 P.2d 1298 (1993). And we consider the facts and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Mountain Park, 125 Wn.2d at 341. The burden is on the moving party to prove no genuine issue of material fact exists. Jacobsen v. State, 89 Wn.2d 104, 108, 569 P.2d 1152 (1977).\nContract Claims\nObligations Imposed by This Contract. Brown v. Hauge spells out the contract exception to the general rule of nonliability:\nThe tenant may recover for personal injuries caused by the landlord\u2019s breach of a repair covenant only if the unrepaired defect created an unreasonable risk of harm to the tenant. The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 357 (1965) provides that the lessor of land is liable if (a) the lessor has contracted to keep the land in repair; (b) the disrepair creates an unreasonable risk that performance of the lessor\u2019s agreement would have prevented; and (c) the lessor fails to exercise reasonable care in performing the agreement.\nBrown v. Hauge, 105 Wn. App. 800, 804, 21 P.3d 716 (2001) (citation omitted). The contract defines the extent of the duty when a landlord\u2019s duty arises out of a covenant. Id.\nBoth the trial court and Mr. Hayford, here on appeal, rely on our decision in Brown for the proposition that the landlord must have notice of the \u201cdefect\u201d before he is subject to liability. Mr. Hayford argues, and the trial court agreed, that Brown is a general statement of the law on notice. We do not read our decision in Brown so broadly.\nIn Brown the landlord had notice of the tenant\u2019s problem (a high door sill). The holding in Brown turned on the nature of the claimed defect, not notice. The contract required the landlord to keep the common areas \u201creasonably clean and safe from defects increasing the hazards of fire or accident.\u201d Id. So, the court reasoned, the landlord was obligated to do something about the door sill only if it was unsafe. All agreed the door sill was inconvenient for the tenants, but nobody \u2014 not the landlord, the tenants, nor a state agent who inspected the premises for a residential adult care facility license \u2014 considered it unsafe. Id. at 802-03, 805. The court ultimately held that the landlord would not be liable under the contract\u2019s safety provision because the door sill was not then unreasonably unsafe. Id. at 805.\nBrown did rely on Teglo v. Porter. Id. at 804. Teglo in turn adopted portions of the Restatement of Torts which are relevant to the claims here:\n\u201cThe lessor\u2019s duty to repair ... is not contractual but is a tort duty based on the fact that the contract gives the lessor ability to make the repairs and control over them. . . . Unless the contract stipulates that the lessor shall inspect the premises to ascertain the need of repairs, a contract to keep the interior in safe condition subjects the lessor to liability if, but only if, reasonable care is not exercised after the lessee has given him notice of the need of repairs.\u201d\nTeglo v. Porter, 65 Wn.2d 772, 774-75, 399 P.2d 519 (1965) (emphasis added) (quoting Restatement of Torts \u00a7 357 cmt. a (1934)).\nNotice then under this provision of the Restatement becomes an issue when the particular condition under consideration is inside the residence where the landlord has no right to enter. But that is not the case here. The source of water here was an outside well, which the landlord had physical access to. Actual notice is not then required.\nHere the lease includes (1) an express covenant of quiet enjoyment and (2) requires that the lessor maintain and repair the leased premises.\nSo the factual question is the usual threshold question where the claim has been dismissed on motion \u2014 whether the condition of this well interfered with their quiet enjoyment of the home, or whether the well required \u201cmajor maintenance\u201d as spelled out in the lease agreement.\nQuiet Enjoyment. No Washington case directly addresses the impact of drinking water on one\u2019s quiet enjoyment of his home. Washington does, however, recognize the relationship of water and habitability. In State ex rel. Andersen v. Superior Court, the court held that without water, a property is uninhabitable. State ex rel. Andersen v. Superior Court, 119 Wash. 406, 407-08, 205 P. 1051 (1922). And in Mitchell v. Straith, the court held that a water system that used an \u201cunusual\u201d approach, but did not affect the water quality, did not render the property uninhabitable. Mitchell v. Straith, 40 Wn. App. 405, 412, 698 P.2d 609 (1985). And in Mathes v. Adams, as the Tuckers point out, the Montana court ultimately held that unsafe drinking water renders a rental property uninhabitable. Mathes v. Adams, 254 Mont. 347, 353, 838 P.2d 390 (1992).\nOther jurisdictions have also held that a property without potable water is uninhabitable.\nIt is well settled that unsafe drinking water renders a home uninhabitable. And that by definition interferes with the quiet enjoyment of the home. The Tuckers have made out an actionable claim for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment if we look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the Tuckers.\nMajor Maintenance and Repair. A health inspector recommended that this well be tested at least annually for bacteria. The question then is whether a reasonable person knew or in the exercise of ordinary care should have known that this well should have been tested annually \u2014 as part of the major maintenance of this home. Again, the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the Tuckers, includes high nitrate levels together with a recommendation for yearly bacteria testing. That is a sufficient showing to support a breach of the major maintenance and repair covenant of this lease, if proved.\nDuties at Common Law\nTraditional Common Law Landlord Liability. Common law landlord liability requires a showing: \u201c \u2018(1) latent or hidden defects in the leasehold (2) that existed at the commencement of the leasehold (3) of which the landlord had actual knowledge (4) and of which the landlord failed to inform the tenant.\u2019 \u201d Frobig v. Gordon, 124 Wn.2d 732, 735, 881 P.2d 226 (1994) (quoting Younger v. United States, 662 F.2d 580, 582 (9th Cir. 1981)). The landlord need not discover obscure defects or dangers, nor does the law impose any duty to repair defective conditions. Aspon v. Loomis, 62 Wn. App. 818, 826-27, 816 P.2d 751 (1991). A \u201clandlord is liable only for failing to inform the tenant of known dangers which are not likely to be discovered by the tenant.\u201d Id. at 827.\nThe Tuckers moved into this home in 1998. The well was last tested in 1993. It was not tested again until after the Tuckers tested it in 2000. But this was after the Tuckers got sick. It had not then been tested for the five years prior to the Tuckers\u2019 moving in despite a recommendation by the health department that it be tested annually. This well was not then maintained at the time the property was leased to the Tuckers. And the condition of the water was certainly hidden or latent as to the Tuckers. Mr. Hayford did not warn the Tuckers. Mr. Hayford was aware of the report that required the annual testing. The Tuckers have then raised an issue of fact \u2014 whether Mr. Hayford knew or should have known of this latent defect.\nA \u201cshould have known\u201d standard is enough since we have eased the strict requirement of actual knowledge. It is sufficient that the landlord knew or should have been able to identify a defect unknown to the tenant at the time of the initial tenancy. Taylor v. Stimson, 52 Wn.2d 278, 280-81, 324 P.2d 1070 (1958); see also Johnson v. Dye, 131 Wash. 637, 230 P. 625 (1924) (basing liability on constructive knowledge where landlord would have discovered the defect if he had made the repairs he was supposed to make near the defect).\nImplied Warranty of Habitability.\nA landlord is subject to liability for physical harm caused to the tenant and others upon the leased property with the consent of the tenant or his subtenant by a dangerous condition existing before or arising after the tenant has taken possession, if he has failed to exercise reasonable care to repair the condition and the existence of the condition is in violation of:\n(1) an implied duty of habitability, or\n(2) a duty created by a statute or administrative regulation.\nRestatement (Second) of Property \u00a7 17.6 (1977) (emphasis added).\nWe adopted this section of the Restatement in Lian v. Stalick. There, we recognized a cause of action for the implied warranty of habitability under the Landlord-Tenant Act according to subpart (1) of the Restatement section 17.6. Lian v. Stalick, 106 Wn. App. 811, 822, 25 P.3d 467 (2001).\nLian then supports the Tuckers\u2019 cause of action under subpart (1) of section 17.6 of the Restatement.\nResidential Landlord-Tenant Act\nThe Tuckers next argue that contrary to our holding in Dexheimer v. CDS, Inc., the Landlord-Tenant Act allows a remedy for personal injury damages.\nThe Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (Uniform Landlord-Tenant Act) was drafted by the National Conference of Commissions on Uniform State Laws in 1972. 5 Thompson on Real Property \u00a7 43.05(b), at 385 (David A. Thomas ed., 1994). While Washington made \u201csubstantial changes\u201d to the Uniform Landlord-Tenant Act when it adopted its own Landlord-Tenant Act, our state\u2019s version still reflects a \u201cstrong [Uniform Landlord-Tenant Act] influence.\u201d Id. at 385 & n.649.\nThe Uniform Landlord-Tenant Act abandoned the \u201cconveyance\u201d aspect of landlord/tenant law as unsuitable for modern times in favor of \u201can interdependent, or contract, view of lease covenants.\u201d Id. at 386 (citing Uniform Landlord-Tenant Act \u00a7 1.102 cmt.). The purpose of the Uniform Landlord-Tenant Act was twofold: \u201c \u2018simplify, clarify, modernize and revise\u2019 \u201d landlord and tenant law, and to \u201c \u2018encourage landlords to maintain and improve the quality of housing.\u2019 \u201d Id. (emphasis added) (quoting Uniform Landlord-Tenant Act \u00a7 1.102).\nWashington\u2019s Landlord-Tenant Act. The Landlord-Tenant Act requires the landlord to \u201ckeep the premises fit for human habitation\u201d and to particularly maintain the premises in substantial compliance with health or safety codes for the benefit of the tenant. RCW 59.18.060(1). It requires the landlord to make repairs, except in the case of normal wear and tear, \u201cnecessary to put and keep the premises in as good condition as it by law or rental agreement should have been, at the commencement of the tenancy.\u201d RCW 59.18.060(5).\nIt lists the landlord\u2019s obligations. RCW 59.18.060. And it lists the tenant\u2019s remedies: (1) terminate the rental agreement; (2) \u201c[b]ring an action in an appropriate court, or at arbitration if so agreed, for any remedy provided under this chapter or otherwise provided by law;\u201d or (3) pursue the other remedies available under the Landlord-Tenant Act. RCW 59.18.090 (emphasis added).\nDexheimer. In. Dexheimer, we rejected a tenant\u2019s claim for tort damages following breach of the Landlord-Tenant Act. We concluded that the tenant\u2019s remedies for the landlord\u2019s breach of RCW 59.18.060 were limited to only those remedies specifically set forth in our Landlord-Tenant Act. Dexheimer v. CDS, Inc., 104 Wn. App. 464, 471,17 P.3d 641 (2001). Other jurisdictions allow a tenant\u2019s cause of action arising from statutory duties under their versions of the Uniform Landlord-Tenant Act. And Washington commentators appear to agree. We conclude that the Washington Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973 provides a cause of action for the injury sustained here.\nCONCLUSION\nWe reverse the trial court\u2019s summary judgment order.\nThe remainder of this opinion has no precedential value. Therefore, it will be filed for public record in accordance with the rules governing unpublished opinions. RCW 2.06.040.\nKato, A.C.J., and Kurtz, J., concur.\n104 Wn.

    "Washington Hydroculture, Inc. v. Payne",
    "Roe, J.\n\u2014In 1975, Frank Payne leased \"2 Model S-1100 'Magic Garden' Hydrophonic [sic] Units located on lessor's property\" from Washington Hydroculture, Inc., in Sunny-side, Washington. The units were fiber glass greenhouses used in growing plants indoors. The following year, the greenhouses were substantially destroyed by fire. The lease provided that:\n3. . . . During the term of this lease, lessee shall maintain said S-1100 unit; and, upon expiration of the term hereof surrender in as good a condition as it shall be when lessee takes possession thereof, except for ordinary wear and tear, [singular]\n(Italics ours.)\nBoth parties moved for summary judgment on the issue of liability. The trial court ruled that lessee Payne was liable for damage to the buildings. At a subsequent trial on the issue of damages, the court held that the defendant was liable for the reasonable cost of returning the premises to the landlord in as good condition as when he leased them, less normal wear and tear. Lessee appeals the adverse summary judgment; Washington Hydroculture cross-appeals on the issue of damages. We affirm.\nThe law in Washington is well settled that, unless there is an agreement to the contrary, the inclusion of a general maintenance and delivery clause in a real property lease obligates the tenant to rebuild in case of fire. Armstrong v. Maybee, 17 Wash. 24, 48 P. 737 (1897). See also Publishers Bldg. Co. v. Miller, 25 Wn.2d 927, 933-38, 172 P.2d 489 (1946); Carstens v. Western Pipe & Steel Co., 142 Wash. 259, 252 P. 939 (1927).\nThe court in Anderson v. Ferguson, 17 Wn.2d 262, 270-71, 135 P.2d 302 (1943), relied upon by the trial court, stated the rule:\nThus, it appears to be the settled law in this state that an unconditional or unqualified covenant on the part of the lessee to maintain and keep premises leased by him in good repair or in as good condition as that existing at the time specified in the lease, and to return the premises at the expiration or termination of the lease in such equivalent condition, obligates the lessee to rebuild in case the buildings leased are destroyed by fire or other casualty during the term. So far as we have been advised, there is no statute in this state modifying this rule.\nWe can find no agreement between the parties which would change this general rule, nor are we persuaded by the authorities cited by the lessee. The court in Anderson v. Ferguson, supra at 271, although recognizing and stating the above rule, nevertheless construed a provision in a lease which did not \"require the lessees to maintain or keep the premises in any particular condition whatever during the period of the term.\" Thus, the general rule did not apply in that case. Here, the lease specifically provides that the lessee shall maintain the premises and surrender them in as good condition as when the lessee took possession. Appellant's criticism of the above case is not persuasive.\nUnited Mut. Sav. Bank v. Riebli, 55 Wn.2d 816, 350 P.2d 651 (1960), concerned the rupture of a pipe embedded in the concrete floor of a leased premises, causing damage to the furnishings therein. Construing that lease as a whole, the court determined that a general covenant to repair does not make the tenants \"insurers of latent defects in the premises.\" (Italics ours.) United Mut. Sav. Bank v. Riebli, supra at 823. Other statements regarding the liability are dicta because the case was only concerned with an unknown, undiscovered defect. In the case at bench, the issue is not defects in the property, but a fire of unknown origin. The tenant must bear the loss.\nThe lessee urges that the rental units were personal property or, even if they were not, that the rule on personal property as found in St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Charles H. Lilly Co., 48 Wn.2d 528, 535-37, 295 P.2d 299 (1956) (St. Paul II), reversing St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Charles H. Lilly Co., 46 Wn.2d 840, 286 P.2d 107 (1955) (St. Paul I) governs this case. That case involved the lease of a Scoopmobile, obviously personal property. St. Paul II enunciated the rule in Washington for bailment contracts. That rule is where the bailee of personal property has contracted to return the property in the condition received, except for normal wear and tear, or words to that effect, then if the subject matter of the bailment is destroyed without fault or negligence on the part of the bailee, any liability on his part for the loss must arise out of the specific words of the contract making him an insurer of the loss irrespective of fault. If the contract does not so provide, the bailee is not liable for nonnegligent loss or acts of God.\nThe dissent in St. Paul I (which became the majority in St. Paul II) quotes at page 847 Perreault v. Circle Club, 326 Mass. 458, 459, 95 N.E.2d 204 (1950):\n\"In the absence of contract increasing the liability of a bailee, he is not liable for loss or damage occurring without his fault. . . . Greater responsibility can be imposed upon a bailee only by his express contract. ...\"\n(Citations omitted.)\nIn this case we are not concerned with the bailment of the property. We are concerned with a lease which from its four corners is a lease of realty. The parties are referred to as \"landlord and tenant\"; the subject matter, though there is no legal description, is denominated \"the premises.\" We thus rely on the general rule for leases of realty and do not find St. Paul II persuasive authority for changing the common-law and well established real property rule in Washington.\nWashington Hydroculture cross-claims on the issue of damages. The trial court apparently awarded damages for the depreciated value of the premises, while Washington Hydroculture claims the proper measure is not the value of the greenhouses before they were destroyed, but the reasonable cost of restoring them to the agreed condition. If only new materials can be used, the tenant is liable for their full cost.\nThe correct measure of damages is the reasonable cost of returning the premises to the condition they were in at the commencement of the lease, less reasonable wear and tear, and not their market value. McFerran v. Heroux, 44 Wn.2d 631, 643, 269 P.2d 815 (1954) (dictum); Yakima Valley Motors, Inc. v. Webb Tractor & Equip. Co., 14 Wn.2d 468, 473, 128 P.2d 507 (1942); DeLano v. Tennent, 138 Wash. 39, 45-46, 244 P. 273, 45 A.L.R. 766 (1926).\nTestimony for Washington Hydroculture was that it would cost $31,403.96 to rebuild the greenhouses. On the other hand, experts for Payne stated the costs at only $13,904.77. On cross-examination Washington Hydroculture demonstrated that extra costs had not been considered by those witnesses. The trial court added these extra costs to Payne's bids, including the depreciated value of some equipment, and concluded the damages totaled $23,780.72.\nThe lessor has not challenged any of the findings of fact, and they thus become the established facts of the case. State Bar Ass'n v. Great W. Union Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 91 Wn.2d 48, 586 P.2d 870 (1978). Our function is to determine whether such findings support the conclusions of law and judgment. In re Bennett, 24 Wn. App. 398, 401, 600 P.2d 1308 (1979).\nThe findings state the amount of damages on different items. The conclusion of law, that the lessee is liable to the lessor for $23,780.72, follows from the findings of fact. The judgment of the trial court is thus affirmed.\nMunson and McIntukff, JJ., concur.\nReconsideration denied May 8, 1980.\nReview granted by Supreme Court July 18, 1980.",

            "text": "Roe, J.\n\u2014In 1975, Frank Payne leased \"2 Model S-1100 'Magic Garden' Hydrophonic [sic] Units located on lessor's property\" from Washington Hydroculture, Inc., in Sunny-side, Washington. The units were fiber glass greenhouses used in growing plants indoors. The following year, the greenhouses were substantially destroyed by fire. The lease provided that:\n3. . . . During the term of this lease, lessee shall maintain said S-1100 unit; and, upon expiration of the term hereof surrender in as good a condition as it shall be when lessee takes possession thereof, except for ordinary wear and tear, [singular]\n(Italics ours.)\nBoth parties moved for summary judgment on the issue of liability. The trial court ruled that lessee Payne was liable for damage to the buildings. At a subsequent trial on the issue of damages, the court held that the defendant was liable for the reasonable cost of returning the premises to the landlord in as good condition as when he leased them, less normal wear and tear. Lessee appeals the adverse summary judgment; Washington Hydroculture cross-appeals on the issue of damages. We affirm.\nThe law in Washington is well settled that, unless there is an agreement to the contrary, the inclusion of a general maintenance and delivery clause in a real property lease obligates the tenant to rebuild in case of fire. Armstrong v. Maybee, 17 Wash. 24, 48 P. 737 (1897). See also Publishers Bldg. Co. v. Miller, 25 Wn.2d 927, 933-38, 172 P.2d 489 (1946); Carstens v. Western Pipe & Steel Co., 142 Wash. 259, 252 P. 939 (1927).\nThe court in Anderson v. Ferguson, 17 Wn.2d 262, 270-71, 135 P.2d 302 (1943), relied upon by the trial court, stated the rule:\nThus, it appears to be the settled law in this state that an unconditional or unqualified covenant on the part of the lessee to maintain and keep premises leased by him in good repair or in as good condition as that existing at the time specified in the lease, and to return the premises at the expiration or termination of the lease in such equivalent condition, obligates the lessee to rebuild in case the buildings leased are destroyed by fire or other casualty during the term. So far as we have been advised, there is no statute in this state modifying this rule.\nWe can find no agreement between the parties which would change this general rule, nor are we persuaded by the authorities cited by the lessee. The court in Anderson v. Ferguson, supra at 271, although recognizing and stating the above rule, nevertheless construed a provision in a lease which did not \"require the lessees to maintain or keep the premises in any particular condition whatever during the period of the term.\" Thus, the general rule did not apply in that case. Here, the lease specifically provides that the lessee shall maintain the premises and surrender them in as good condition as when the lessee took possession. Appellant's criticism of the above case is not persuasive.\nUnited Mut. Sav. Bank v. Riebli, 55 Wn.2d 816, 350 P.2d 651 (1960), concerned the rupture of a pipe embedded in the concrete floor of a leased premises, causing damage to the furnishings therein. Construing that lease as a whole, the court determined that a general covenant to repair does not make the tenants \"insurers of latent defects in the premises.\" (Italics ours.) United Mut. Sav. Bank v. Riebli, supra at 823. Other statements regarding the liability are dicta because the case was only concerned with an unknown, undiscovered defect. In the case at bench, the issue is not defects in the property, but a fire of unknown origin. The tenant must bear the loss.\nThe lessee urges that the rental units were personal property or, even if they were not, that the rule on personal property as found in St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Charles H. Lilly Co., 48 Wn.2d 528, 535-37, 295 P.2d 299 (1956) (St. Paul II), reversing St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Charles H. Lilly Co., 46 Wn.2d 840, 286 P.2d 107 (1955) (St. Paul I) governs this case. That case involved the lease of a Scoopmobile, obviously personal property. St. Paul II enunciated the rule in Washington for bailment contracts. That rule is where the bailee of personal property has contracted to return the property in the condition received, except for normal wear and tear, or words to that effect, then if the subject matter of the bailment is destroyed without fault or negligence on the part of the bailee, any liability on his part for the loss must arise out of the specific words of the contract making him an insurer of the loss irrespective of fault. If the contract does not so provide, the bailee is not liable for nonnegligent loss or acts of God.\nThe dissent in St. Paul I (which became the majority in St. Paul II) quotes at page 847 Perreault v. Circle Club, 326 Mass. 458, 459, 95 N.E.2d 204 (1950):\n\"In the absence of contract increasing the liability of a bailee, he is not liable for loss or damage occurring without his fault. . . . Greater responsibility can be imposed upon a bailee only by his express contract. ...\"\n(Citations omitted.)\nIn this case we are not concerned with the bailment of the property. We are concerned with a lease which from its four corners is a lease of realty. The parties are referred to as \"landlord and tenant\"; the subject matter, though there is no legal description, is denominated \"the premises.\" We thus rely on the general rule for leases of realty and do not find St. Paul II persuasive authority for changing the common-law and well established real property rule in Washington.\nWashington Hydroculture cross-claims on the issue of damages. The trial court apparently awarded damages for the depreciated value of the premises, while Washington Hydroculture claims the proper measure is not the value of the greenhouses before they were destroyed, but the reasonable cost of restoring them to the agreed condition. If only new materials can be used, the tenant is liable for their full cost.\nThe correct measure of damages is the reasonable cost of returning the premises to the condition they were in at the commencement of the lease, less reasonable wear and tear, and not their market value. McFerran v. Heroux, 44 Wn.2d 631, 643, 269 P.2d 815 (1954) (dictum); Yakima Valley Motors, Inc. v. Webb Tractor & Equip. Co., 14 Wn.2d 468, 473, 128 P.2d 507 (1942); DeLano v. Tennent, 138 Wash. 39, 45-46, 244 P. 273, 45 A.L.R. 766 (1926).\nTestimony for Washington Hydroculture was that it would cost $31,403.96 to rebuild the greenhouses. On the other hand, experts for Payne stated the costs at only $13,904.77. On cross-examination Washington Hydroculture demonstrated that extra costs had not been considered by those witnesses. The trial court added these extra costs to Payne's bids, including the depreciated value of some equipment, and concluded the damages totaled $23,780.72.\nThe lessor has not challenged any of the findings of fact, and they thus become the established facts of the case. State Bar Ass'n v. Great W. Union Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n, 91 Wn.2d 48, 586 P.2d 870 (1978). Our function is to determine whether such findings support the conclusions of law and judgment. In re Bennett, 24 Wn. App. 398, 401, 600 P.2d 1308 (1979).\nThe findings state the amount of damages on different items. The conclusion of law, that the lessee is liable to the lessor for $23,780.72, follows from the findings of fact. The judgment of the trial court is thus affirmed.\nMunson and McIntukff, JJ., concur.\nReconsideration denied May 8, 1980.\nReview granted by Supreme Court July 18, 1980.",

    "McCutcheon v. United Homes Corp.",
    "REVIEW GRANTED BY SUPREME COURT\nPetrie, J.\nTwo tenants living in an apartment complex instituted independent actions to recover damages for injuries allegedly caused by the landlord\u2019s negligent maintenance of common passageways. Tenant McCutcheon alleged injuries from a fall down an unlighted interior stairway. Tenant Fuller alleged injuries when he fell down an exterior wooden stairway. Both tenants had previously signed a lease which contained the following exculpatory clause:\nThat neither the Lessor, nor his Agent, shall be liable for any injury to Lessee, his family, guests or employees or any other person entering the premises or the building of which the demised premises are a part.\nThe landlord, in each lawsuit, set up as an affirmative defense the exculpatory provision of the lease and moved for summary judgment. The trial court granted the motions and dismissed the complaints. Both tenants appeal from the summary judgment and their appeals have been consolidated.\nThe scope of the exculpatory clause is not questioned because the tenants concede that if the clause is valid, it is an effective bar to their lawsuit. The sole issue presented upon this appeal is the validity of exculpatory clauses appearing within residential lease agreements. Tenants contend that such clauses are void as against the public policy of the state of Washington.\nThe prevailing rule in regards to the validity of exculpatory agreements is succinctly stated in Restatement of Contracts \u00a7 574 (1932) at 1079:\nA bargain for exemption from liability for the consequences of negligence not falling greatly below the standard established by law for the protection of others against unreasonable risk of harm, is legal except in the cases stated in \u00a7 575.\nIt is clear that Washington follows the restatement rule. Broderson v. Rainier Nat\u2019l Park Co., 187 Wash. 399, 60 P.2d 234 (1936); Griffiths v. Henry Broderick, Inc., 27 Wn.2d 901, 182 P.2d 18 (1947), wherein the court in each instance declared that the exculpatory agreements in question were not repugnant to this state\u2019s public policy. In Griffiths, the court cited, and in Broderson, the court quoted the above passage from the restatement.\nThe stated exceptions contained in \u00a7 575 of the restatement prohibit contractual exculpation from the consequences of (1) willful breach of duty; (2) simple breach of duty arising out of the employment relationship; and (3) breach of duty by a person charged with a duty of public service.\nMost courts, which have been called upon to determine the question, have upheld the validity of exculpatory clauses appearing within residential or apartment lease agreements. See Eastern Ave. Corp. v. Hughes, 228 Md. 477, 180 A.2d 486 (1962) and cases and texts cited therein. The relatively few courts which have declared such agreements invalid have done so on the strength of specific legislation, such as public housing codes, which place affirmative public duties upon landlords. Feldman v. Stein Bldg. & Lumber Co., 6 Mich. App. 180, 148 N.W.2d 544 (1967); Kuzmiak v. Brookchester, Inc., 33 N.J. Super. 575, 111 A.2d 425 (1955). In addition, three states, Maryland, Massachusetts and New York, have enacted specific legislation declaring such agreements to be void. New Hampshire prohibits any waiver of the common law duty of ordinary care. Papakalos v. Shaka, 91 N. H. 265, 18 A.2d 377 (1941).\nTenants in the instant case have made no contention that the exculpatory clause contravenes any Washington statute, nor has our attention been called to any such enactment. Tenants do, however, contend that the case of Thomas v. Housing Auth., 71 Wn.2d 69, 426 P.2d 836 (1967) supports their position. Because of the difference in the character and relationship of the parties to the agreement in Thomas, that case is not determinative of the issue here presented. The landlord in the Thomas case was charged with a statutory public duty of providing safe and sanitary housing for persons of low income. The court therefore held that such a statutory duty could not be waived. This is in accord with the exceptions to the general rule as stated in Restatement of Contracts \u00a7 575.\nIn light of this state\u2019s policy of validating exculpatory agreements in general, Griffiths v. Henry Broderick, Inc., supra, and in the absence of any legislative expression to the contrary, we can discern no public policy which is violated by the exculpatory clause in question. We view this as an area for distinct concern because of the potentiality for unwarranted abuse, but nevertheless deem this a subject peculiarly appropriate for legislative, rather than judicial, action.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nArmstrong, C. J., and Pearson, J., concur.\nMaryland\u2019s prohibitory statute was enacted ' subsequent to the court\u2019s opinion in Eastern Ave. Corp. v. Hughes, supra.",

    "Frisken v. Art Strand Floor Coverings, Inc.",
    "Rosellini, J.\nThe respondent, Florence Frisken, is the owner of a building in Shelton, Washington, occupied by her tenant, Mell Chevrolet Company. On November 20, 1952, she entered into an agreement with the appellant, a corporation engaged in the business of selling and laying floor coverings, whereby the latter contracted to furnish and install grease-proof asphalt-tile flooring in the showroom and office of the respondent\u2019s building.\nPrior to the submission of the appellant\u2019s bid, its president, Arthur E. Strand, examined the floors of the showroom and office, which were of concrete covered with magnesite, and recommended a tile which would meet the respondent\u2019s needs. The appellant\u2019s bid was accepted, and by December 3, 1952, the installation was completed.\nWithin a week or ten days after the flooring was laid, it was observed that a dark sticky substance was oozing up between the tiles. On the strength of the appellant\u2019s assurance that the condition was temporary and would disappear in a few weeks, the respondent paid for the flooring.\nWhen the oozing or sloughing continued after six weeks had elapsed, complaint was made again, but it appears that nothing was done to correct the condition. Eventually the magnesite beneath the tile grew spongy and caused the floor to rise in spots, resulting in an uneven surface and cracks in the tile. Agents of the appellant inspected the floor and reported that the magnesite was crumbling and falling apart. Still nothing was done to repair or remedy the condition, and after it had continued for more than a year, this action was commenced to recover upon an alleged breach of an implied warranty of fitness.\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a judgment in favor of the respondent.\nWhile the appellant admits that the flooring is not satisfactory for the purpose for which it was intended, it contends that (1) the defects were caused by factors beyond its control, and that the implied warranty of fitness does not cover such defects, or (2) if there was a breach of warranty, the defect was waived when the respondent paid for the installation.\nThe defense of waiver was not pleaded, and the appellant did not request a finding that the respondent had waived the defect. As we have often said, this court will not consider a theory which was not passed upon by the trial court and is presented for the first time on appeal. Muck v. Snohomish County Public Utility Dist., 41 Wn. (2d) 81, 247 P. (2d) 233 (1952); Smith v. King County, 28 Wn. (2d) 917, 184P. (2d) 562 (1947).\nThe facts as found by the trial court do not establish a waiver, since payment was made after the appellant had given its assurance that the sloughing would disappear, a fact which negatives any implication of an intent to waive the defect. Furthermore, the full extent of the damage did not appear until several months after payment was made. The fact that the respondent had paid for the flooring would not deprive her of her right to recover for a breach of which she neither knew nor had reason to know at the time. See Eliason v. Walker, 42 Wn. (2d) 473, 256 P. (2d) 298 (1953), a case in which the plaintiffs, purchasers of a heating system, elected to rescind the contract after the equipment had been paid for and had been in operation for three months. We held that the delay did not constitute a waiver of their right to rescind for breach of warranty, since the inadequacy of the heating system was not established until it had been in operation for some time.\nWe turn now to the appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in finding a breach of warranty. According to the findings, the respondent advised the appellant that an attractive floor was needed because the room was to be used for display purposes; she relied upon the skill and judgment of the appellant\u2019s agent, who represented to her that the appellant could and would install a floor which would satisfy her needs. The floor, the trial court found, was entirely unsatisfactory. It concluded that there had been a breach of the implied warranty of fitness imposed under Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 5836-15 [cf. RCW 63.04.160], which provides in part as follows:\n\u201c (1) Where the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required, and it appears that the buyer relies on the seller\u2019s skill or judgment (whether he be the grower or manufacturer or not), there is an implied warranty that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose.\u201d\nThe appellant argues that there was no competent evidence that the unsatisfactory condition was caused by faulty installation, and it is the custom of contractors not to warrant that magnesite flooring will not deteriorate and damage tile which is laid over it; therefore, there could be no implied warranty of fitness. In regard to the latter contention, there was scant evidence of such a general custom; the trial court made no finding that a custom existed, and none was requested. This facet of the argument is consequently without merit.\nThe respondent\u2019s expert witness, to whose qualifications the appellant made no objection, testified that the sloughing and unevenness was caused by moisture coming up through the magnesite, and that the \u201csweating\u201d could have been avoided by the use of a sealer. The appellant\u2019s expert witnesses testified that there is no sealer which can prevent this sweating, and that it occurs where no barrier has been erected beneath the magnesite or concrete; that there is nothing which can be done to prevent the occurrence once the magnesite and concrete have been improperly laid. The record contains no finding on this precise point, and apparently the trial court did not consider it controlling. Assuming that the fact was established, this in itself does not relieve the appellant of liability.\nWhile the appellant\u2019s president testified that he did not and could not have anticipated the condition which developed, he stated that the magnesite was tested for moisture before the tile was laid. The inescapable inference is that he knew of the possibility that moisture would rise through the magnesite and damage the tile. Furthermore, another of appellant\u2019s witnesses, also a flooring contractor, testified that, unless a water barrier is installed, magnesite has a tendency to sweat and cause discoloration of the tile, and that it is customary to warn the purchaser of this possibility. In this instance, no inquiry was made to ascertain whether a water barrier had been installed, and the respondent was not advised of the risk involved.\nNo error is assigned to the court\u2019s finding that the appellant was familiar with climatic conditions in the area and knew the location of the floor with reference to the ground level as well as the nature and composition of the subflooring. Knowing or being charged with knowledge that there was a risk involved, of which respondent was obviously ignorant, and having failed to warn her of this risk before she made her investment, the appellant must be held to have warranted that the floor would be fit for the intended use regardless of the structure of the underflooring. It is the respondent\u2019s ignorance of the nature and characteristics of floorings which establishes her reliance on the appellant\u2019s skill and judgment. Had the deterioration of the tile resulted from some latent defect in the underflooring which the appellant could not have anticipated, or which the respondent as well as the appellant might have anticipated, a different question would be presented.\nThe view we take is in accord with our holding in Columbia Concrete Pipe Co. v. Knowles, 36 Wn. (2d) 602, 219 P. (2d) 557 (1950). The defendant in that case, a farmer in eastern Washington, had contracted with the plaintiff for the purchase and installation of a pipe line which would irrigate certain designated portions of his farm. It was agreed that the defendant would dig the ditch for the pipe line, which he proceeded to do. The plaintiff\u2019s agents, knowing that the ditch was probably too shallow, nevertheless laid the pipe, which soon sprang a number of leaks and proved to be unsatisfactory. Had the pipe been laid at the proper depth, it appeared that the leaks would not have occurred. We held that subdivision (1) of Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 5836-15, was applicable, and that the defendant, having made known to the plaintiff the purpose for which the pipe line was to be used and having relied upon the plaintiff\u2019s skill and judgment, was entitled to recover on his cross-complaint for a breach of an implied warranty of fitness.\nAs we said in Lundquist v. Coca Cola Bottling, Inc., 42 Wn. (2d) 170, 254 P. (2d) 488 (1953), it is not necessary to prove negligence in order to recover for a breach of an implied warranty. The plaintiff must allege and prove: first, that he made known to the seller, either expressly or by implication, the particular purpose for which the article was required, and second, that it appeared that he relied upon the seller\u2019s skill and judgment when he purchased the article. Under the rule of Columbia Concrete Pipe Co. v. Knowles, supra, if the seller undertakes to install the purchased item, he impliedly warrants that, after installation, it will be fit for the use intended. Of course, the seller may disclaim such a warranty, or the circumstances may negative reliance; but there is no evidence of a disclaimer here, and there is no question but that the respondent relied upon the appellant\u2019s superior skill and judgment, and that the appellant was made aware of this fact.\nAs we have construed the statute, the facts of this case fall within its provisions.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nHamley, C.

            "text": "Rosellini, J.\nThe respondent, Florence Frisken, is the owner of a building in Shelton, Washington, occupied by her tenant, Mell Chevrolet Company. On November 20, 1952, she entered into an agreement with the appellant, a corporation engaged in the business of selling and laying floor coverings, whereby the latter contracted to furnish and install grease-proof asphalt-tile flooring in the showroom and office of the respondent\u2019s building.\nPrior to the submission of the appellant\u2019s bid, its president, Arthur E. Strand, examined the floors of the showroom and office, which were of concrete covered with magnesite, and recommended a tile which would meet the respondent\u2019s needs. The appellant\u2019s bid was accepted, and by December 3, 1952, the installation was completed.\nWithin a week or ten days after the flooring was laid, it was observed that a dark sticky substance was oozing up between the tiles. On the strength of the appellant\u2019s assurance that the condition was temporary and would disappear in a few weeks, the respondent paid for the flooring.\nWhen the oozing or sloughing continued after six weeks had elapsed, complaint was made again, but it appears that nothing was done to correct the condition. Eventually the magnesite beneath the tile grew spongy and caused the floor to rise in spots, resulting in an uneven surface and cracks in the tile. Agents of the appellant inspected the floor and reported that the magnesite was crumbling and falling apart. Still nothing was done to repair or remedy the condition, and after it had continued for more than a year, this action was commenced to recover upon an alleged breach of an implied warranty of fitness.\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a judgment in favor of the respondent.\nWhile the appellant admits that the flooring is not satisfactory for the purpose for which it was intended, it contends that (1) the defects were caused by factors beyond its control, and that the implied warranty of fitness does not cover such defects, or (2) if there was a breach of warranty, the defect was waived when the respondent paid for the installation.\nThe defense of waiver was not pleaded, and the appellant did not request a finding that the respondent had waived the defect. As we have often said, this court will not consider a theory which was not passed upon by the trial court and is presented for the first time on appeal. Muck v. Snohomish County Public Utility Dist., 41 Wn. (2d) 81, 247 P. (2d) 233 (1952); Smith v. King County, 28 Wn. (2d) 917, 184P. (2d) 562 (1947).\nThe facts as found by the trial court do not establish a waiver, since payment was made after the appellant had given its assurance that the sloughing would disappear, a fact which negatives any implication of an intent to waive the defect. Furthermore, the full extent of the damage did not appear until several months after payment was made. The fact that the respondent had paid for the flooring would not deprive her of her right to recover for a breach of which she neither knew nor had reason to know at the time. See Eliason v. Walker, 42 Wn. (2d) 473, 256 P. (2d) 298 (1953), a case in which the plaintiffs, purchasers of a heating system, elected to rescind the contract after the equipment had been paid for and had been in operation for three months.

    "Department of Ecology v. Abbott",
    "Utter, J.\nWater resource allocation concerns everyone in our state. Its common use for household consumption, agriculture, manufacturing and hydroelectric power makes water a highly coveted resource. While of concern to all, those most acutely affected by developments in our water law live in the more arid portions of our state east of the Cascade Range. The two cases before this court today concern land east of the Cascades and involve the status of riparian rights in Washington water law. See Department of Ecology v. Adsit, 103 Wn.2d 698, 694 P.2d 1065 (1985). In this case, the State appeals from a trial court ruling reversing a referee's determination at a 1982 stream adjudication and issuing a partial summary judgment declaring a riparian's common law rights to water undiminished by the 1917 water code. We reverse the trial judge and hold that the 1917 water code established prior appropriation as the dominant water law in Washington. After 1917, new water rights may be acquired only through compliance with the permit system and existing water rights not put to beneficial use are relinquished. The permit system, modified over time to require a permit for all water put to beneficial use, allows the State to efficiently implement the state water policy, most recently articulated by the Legislature in 1979:\nIt is the policy of the state to promote the use of the public waters in a fashion which provides for obtaining maximum net benefits arising from both diversionary uses of the state's public waters and the retention of waters within streams and lakes in sufficient quantity and quality to protect instream and natural values and rights.\nRCW 90.03.005.\nI\nIn the early 1900's, John Fuher began operating a sawmill on the banks of Deadman Creek on property now owned by Riddle, the respondent in this appeal. The sawmill diverted water from the creek for log washing. In 1921, Fuher moved the sawmill to the opposite bank of the creek and continued to divert water. At that time, he also constructed a small pond which was continuously filled with fresh water. The sawmill continued in operation until the mid-1940's, at about which time respondents acquired the land. In August 1911, after the sawmill was already operating, Fuher filed a notice of appropriation with the Spokane County Auditor declaring his intent to divert 4.0 cubic feet per second (c.f.s.) of water for irrigation and other beneficial uses.\nSixty years later, on September 24, 1971, J. C. Riddle filed water right claim 5924, claiming the right to divert and use 4.0 c.f.s. of the waters of Deadman Creek for irrigation of 200 acres. Although the water has been used for irrigation for at least the last 15 to 20 years, the referee in a 1982 adjudication denied Riddle's claim of a water right of that quantity acquired from Fuher and confirmed a water right of a much smaller amount. The referee indicated that Fuher irrigated only about 15 acres in either 1922 or 1923. Except for the sawmill, there was no evidence of continuous use between the early 1920's and the early 1950's. The trial court, relying on Riddle's status as a riparian, granted Riddle partial summary judgment and remanded to the referee.\nIn reversing the referee, the trial judge declared that a riparian owner's common law rights to \"ordinary\" and \"natural\" (domestic) uses of water were unaffected by either the 1917 water code or the 1969 water rights act. He concluded that the right to \"ordinary\" and \"natural\" uses inheres in the ownership of the property and is neither acquired through actual usage nor lost through disuse. He also concluded that the 1917 code did not require unexer-cised riparian rights to be exercised within any particular time from the June 6, 1917 effective date, nor did it require changes in \"ordinary\" and \"natural\" use to be approved by the State.\nII\nRiparian rights, where they exist, derive from the ownership of land contiguous to or traversed by a watercourse. Crook v. Hewitt, 4 Wash. 749, 749-50, 31 P. 28 (1892) (\"the law is uniformly settled that every proprietor of lands on the bank of a river has naturally an equal right to the use of the water which flows in the stream adjacent to his lands, as it was wont to run, without diminution or alteration\"). Riparian rights in Washington can be traced to an enactment of the territorial Legislature adopting the common law of England as the rule of decision in territorial courts. See Laws of 1862, p. 82, ch. 1; see also Benton v. Johncox, 17 Wash. 277, 280-81, 49 P. 495 (1897).\nThe Washington Constitution did not mention riparian rights. As to water rights, it provides in article 21, section 1 that the \"use of the waters of this state for irrigation, mining and manufacturing purposes shall be deemed a public use.\" No specific guaranty of the vitality of the riparian rights doctrine appeared in either the 1890 or the 1891 implementing legislation. Provision for condemnation of riparian rights in the 1890 act, however, makes clear that riparian rights continued to exist. See Laws of 1889, ch. 21, p. 722, \u00a7 57. The implementing statute passed in 1891 provided:\nThe right to the use of water in any lake, pond or flowing spring in this state, or the right to the use of water flowing in any river, stream or ravine of this state for irrigation, mining or manufacturing purposes, or for supplying cities, towns or villages with water, or for water works, may be acquired by appropriation, and as between appropriations the first in time is the first in right.\nLaws of 1891, ch. 142, \u00a7 1, p. 327. Section 9 of the act read:\nWater appropriated for any of the purposes in this act mentioned may be changed to any other purpose herein specified or to any other beneficial use, and the right to such use shall relate back to the original appropriation.\nThe 1891 act also stated that \"this act shall not be construed to interfere with vested rights.\" Laws of 1891, ch. 142, \u00a7 7, p. 328.\nAppropriative rights, as provided for by statute, and riparian rights, derived from the common law, existed simultaneously. Conflict between riparian and appropriative rights was addressed as early as the first volume of Washington Reports. Geddis v. Parrish, 1 Wash. 587, 21 P. 314 (1889). The \"California\" or dual system of riparian and appropriative rights was fully recognized in our state in Benton v. Johncox, supra. There, the court recognized riparian ownership as superior to subsequent appropriation. Benton, at 288. It further decided that riparian rights date to the inception of title by the government patentee and noted the common law rule \"that every riparian proprietor has an equal right to the use of water as it is accustomed to flow, without diminution or alteration, is subject to the well recognized limitation that each owner may make a reasonable use of the water for domestic, agricultural and manufacturing purposes . . .\". Benton, at 290.\nUnder the common law, mere disuse of riparian rights did not destroy or suspend their existence. Rigney v. Tacoma Light & Water Co., 9 Wash. 576, 38 P. 147 (1894); Lux v. Haggin, 69 Cal. 255, 391, 10 P. 674 (1886). The perpetuity of the right, however, was subject to impairment or destruction through adverse use by others or creation of an estoppel against the riparian proprietor. 2 W. Hutchins, Water Rights Laws in the Nineteen Western States 25 (1974).\nStrict application of the riparian rights doctrine led to problems. The riparian rights doctrine prevented appropriative or riparian development by others, even if the riparian rights had never been exercised. As population density increased, demand for water grew and the vitality of the riparian doctrine began to wane. See Trelease, Coordination of Riparian and Appropriative Rights to the Use of Water, 33 Tex. L. Rev. 24, 25-26 (1954). In 1907, the Supreme Court upheld the 1890 statute which provided that riparian rights may be condemned for irrigation purposes, subject to the irrigation needs of the riparian. State ex rel. Kettle Falls Power & Irrig. Co. v. Superior Court, 46 Wash. 500, 90 P. 650 (1907). The condemnation statute was again at issue later that year. The court discussed the meaning and intention of the phrase \"needed for [irrigation] by any [riparian]11:\nWe think it means the water necessary to irrigate the land of the littoral or riparian owner which he now has under irrigation, and also that which he intends to, and will, place under irrigation within a reasonable time. It cannot be supposed that the legislature intended that a riparian owner could prevent an irrigating company from appropriating water not then in use but which the riparian owner might need and use upon his land at some distant, indefinite time in the future. Such a construction would be in the interest of the speculator rather than for the encouragement of the land improver and home builder. ... If [the riparian] is not using the water and does not propose to use it as soon as practicable in the ordinary and reasonable development or cultivation of his lands, then there is no reason why the water should be withheld from others who need and will promptly use it if permitted.\n(Italics ours.) State ex rel. Liberty Lk. Irrig. Co. v. Superior Court, 47 Wash. 310, 313-14, 91 P. 968 (1907).\nErosion of riparian rights as the dominant force in Washington water law continued with the enactment of the water code of 1917. Until 1917, there existed two ways for a nonriparian owner to obtain an appropriative right to water: by taking water from the public domain and putting it to beneficial use, Thorpe v. Tenem Ditch Co., 1 Wash. 566, 20 P. 588 (1889), or by posting a statutory notice at the point of diversion and commencing construction of the works. Laws of 1891, ch. 142, \u00a7 2, p. 327. The 1917 code abrogated the acts of 1890 and 1891 and provided for a new system of application, permit and certification by the supervisor of hydraulics (now the supervisor of water resources).\nThe water code of 1917 declares that, subject to existing rights, \"all waters within the state belong to the public, and any right thereto . . . shall be hereafter acquired ... in the manner provided and not otherwise . . .\". (Italics ours.) RCW 90.03.010. \"Any person . . . desiring to appropriate water for a beneficial use shall [apply] to the supervisor of water resources for a permit . . . and shall not use or divert such waters until he has received a permit . . .\". RCW 90.03.250. No exception is made for waters devoted to \"ordinary\", \"natural\" or domestic uses. There is no indication that rights which vested before the water code were to be excluded from general water rights adjudications or otherwise treated differently. For example, RCW 90.03.120 calls for service in an adjudication of \"all known persons claiming the right to divert the water involved . . .\". No distinction is made as to the kind of use.\nNothing in the 1917 water code \"shall be construed to lessen, enlarge, or modify the existing rights of any riparian owner, or any existing right acquired by appropriation, or otherwise.\" (Italics ours.) RCW 90.03.010. The code also continued and enlarged condemnation rights by giving any person the power to condemn an inferior use for a superior beneficial use. RCW 90.03.040. Shortly after adoption of the code, the Supreme Court held that a riparian owner intending future use could not prevent condemnation by a nonriparian owner for an immediate use for power. State ex rel. South Fork Log Driving Co. v. Superior Court, 102 Wash. 460, 470, 173 P. 192 (1918) (the test for condemnation is \"the extent and manner of the proposed use as compared with the present use\"). Finally, the 1917 water code required that a change in use of all pre-code vested rights must be approved by the supervisor of hydraulics. RCW 90.03.380.\nThe trial judge in this case, despite the shift away from the primacy of riparian rights by the courts and Legislature, concluded that the appropriative permit system embodied in the 1917 water code applied only to surplus waters in excess of those required for \"ordinary\" or \"natural\" domestic uses by riparians. He also interpreted the forfeiture provisions of the water rights act as applying only to public uses enumerated in article 1, section 16 of the state constitution. Although we need not decide questions concerning that here, even partial adoption of the trial court opinion would effectively create a domestic use exemption from the permit system and state management of water resources. The Legislature did expressly create a domestic exemption in the groundwater code, RCW 90.44-.050, but it has never seen fit to create such an exemption for surface water.\nWe cannot agree with the trial court's conclusion. The trial judge relied on two decisions subsequent to the 1917 water code in concluding that domestic uses did not fall within the purview of the code. Yet, we believe neither of those cases reached that question. Brown v. Chase, 125 Wash. 542, 217 P. 23 (1923) and Proctor v. Sim, 134 Wash. 606, 236 P. 114 (1925) were both concerned with determining whether the clause in the 1917 code protecting the \"existing rights\" of riparian owners, see RCW 90.03.010, applied to unused rights.\nWhether unused riparian rights survived adoption of the use-oriented 1917 water code has been much discussed. See Horowitz, Riparian and Appropriation Rights to the Use of Water in Washington, 7 Wash. L. Rev. 197 (1932); Morris, Washington Water Rights \u2014 A Sketch, 31 Wash. L. Rev. 243 (1956); Johnson, Riparian and Public Rights to Lakes and Streams, 35 Wash. L. Rev. 580 (1960); Corker & Roe, Washington's New Water Rights Law \u2014 Improvements Needed, 44 Wash. L. Rev. 85 (1968). The referee in this case determined that the \"[e]xtent of the right is limited to the amount of water developed and used under diligent pursuance and completion of any project as originally contemplated and which was initiated within three years after the effective date of the 1917 Surface Water Code. (June 6, 1917)\". Report of Referee, at 15.\nBrown v. Chase, supra, presented a contest between riparians whose rights were unexercised and an applicant for an appropriation permit under the 1917 water code. The trial court overturned a permit on the grounds that a riparian owner is entitled to \"the undiminished unpolluted flow of the stream past his land.\" In reversing the trial court, the Supreme Court adopted the approach taken in Kettle Falls Power, and stated:\n[I]n consonance with the general needs and welfare of the state, especially in the arid and semi-arid regions, and in harmony with the legislation upon the matter, we are now prepared to declare . . . that (1) waters of non-navigable streams in excess of the amount which can be beneficially used, either directly or prospectively, within a reasonable time, on, or in connection with riparian lands, are subject to appropriation for use on non-riparian lands.\n(Italics ours.) 125 Wash, at 553, 217 P. at 26-27.\nProctor v. Sim, supra, involved a situation similar to that in Brown v. Chase, supra. The riparian rights concerned derived from ownership of land bordering a nonnavigable lake. The court reasoned, \" [i]t would seem a waste of energy to compel the surplus waters of a stream to labor on arid lands and at the same time permit surplus waters of a lake to lie idle.\" Proctor, 134 Wash, at 619. Read in isolation, attempting to support preferential treatment for domestic use, one might conclude that a substantive difference in the nature of \"surplus\" waters actually exists. However, review of the opinion shows that the term \"surplus\" refers to those waters not already put to use by the riparian. The court determined that the \"existing rights\" which the water code protected referred to \"the right to the beneficial use of such portions of the waters ... as are either directly or prospectively, within a reasonable time, proper and necessary for the irrigation of their lands and for the usual domestic purposes.\" Proctor v. Sim, supra at 615-16.\nBrown v. Chase, supra, and Proctor v. Sim, supra, are not surprising decisions when viewed in light of the movement toward use-oriented rights. In a dual system, nonuse of any riparian rights results in their forfeiture. J. Sax, Water Law, Planning and Policy 287 (1968); see State v. American Fruit Growers, Inc., 135 Wash. 156, 237 P. 498 (1925). On the other hand, Brown v. Chase, supra, and Proctor v. Sim, supra, both imply that the code did not extinguish unused water rights as of 1917 but as of a later date, adequate to allow riparian owners to learn about the code and take steps to protect their interests. Many commentators, and several courts, have determined that either the statute or the decisional law of this court has eliminated unused riparian rights. Disagreement, however, is widespread as to when that relinquishment occurred. See Corker & Roe, 44 Wash. L. Rev. at 114-18; see also 2 W. Hutchins, Water Rights Laws in the Nineteen Western States 14 (1974). The time when relinquishment occurred must be settled to decide today's case.\nSix years after Proctor v. Sim, supra, was decided, four members of Department One of this court agreed that a claim to riparian rights which had not and would not be exercised \"within a reasonable time\" was properly rejected by a trial court reviewing an adjudication. In re Sinlahekin Creek, 162 Wash. 635, 299 P. 649 (1931). Because Sinlahekin Creek and the other cases applying the \"reasonable time\" standard are all forward looking, the Department of Ecology suggests 1932 as the date by which unused riparian rights must have been put to use or forfeited. Our cases support adoption of that year as the cutoff date for exercise of unused riparian rights; 15 years after enactment of the water code, we now hold, as a matter of law, constitutes adequate notice.\nThe referee's denial of Riddle's claim based on Fuher's riparian status was proper. No rights sought were exercised for irrigation purposes prior to 1917. Fuher lost his claim to these unexercised riparian rights by 1932 and therefore transferred only those exercised to Riddle.\nRespondents assert that the sawmill use through the 1940's, along with their predecessor's irrigation use, supports retention of a right based on Fuher's beneficial use. Generally, an appropriator is not limited to the use for which the appropriation was initially made. See In re Alpowa Creek, 129 Wash. 9, 224 P. 29 (1924).\nSince 1917, however, by statute changes in use must first be approved by the supervisor of water resources. In this case, a change in use from log washing to irrigation should be allowed only if an application to do so was filed with and approved by the supervisor of water resources. Neither Fuher nor Riddle appears to have sought approval for the change in use.\nIll\nRiddle asserts that the forfeiture of riparian rights for nonuse effects an unconstitutional taking. In Washington, we have previously held that the permit requirement for bringing a water right into existence in the first instance is a reasonable exercise of the State's police power. Peterson v. Department of Ecology, 92 Wn.2d 306, 596 P.2d 285 (1979). In other states, it is well established that riparian rights may be extinguished or limited by statute. 2 W. Hutchins, at 290-97. That a state has the power to either modify or reject the doctrine of riparian rights because unsuited to the conditions in the state and to put into effect the doctrine of prior appropriation has long been settled. See, e.g., Baumann v. Smrha, 145 F. Supp. 617, 624 (D. Kan.), aff'd, 352 U.S. 863 (1956); In re Water Rights of Hood River, 114 Or. 112, 227 P. 1065 (1924).\nNeither the Legislature nor our courts have gone so far as to eliminate riparian rights, as other states have. Consumptive, recreational and aesthetic riparian rights are considered to be vested property rights. Department of Ecology v. Acquavella, 100 Wn.2d 651, 674 P.2d 160 (1983); Bach ",

            "text": "Utter, J.\nWater resource allocation concerns everyone in our state. Its common use for household consumption, agriculture, manufacturing and hydroelectric power makes water a highly coveted resource. While of concern to all, those most acutely affected by developments in our water law live in the more arid portions of our state east of the Cascade Range. The two cases before this court today concern land east of the Cascades and involve the status of riparian rights in Washington water law. See Department of Ecology v. Adsit, 103 Wn.2d 698, 694 P.2d 1065 (1985). In this case, the State appeals from a trial court ruling reversing a referee's determination at a 1982 stream adjudication and issuing a partial summary judgment declaring a riparian's common law rights to water undiminished by the 1917 water code. We reverse the trial judge and hold that the 1917 water code established prior appropriation as the dominant water law in Washington. After 1917, new water rights may be acquired only through compliance with the permit system and existing water rights not put to beneficial use are relinquished. The permit system, modified over time to require a permit for all water put to beneficial use, allows the State to efficiently implement the state water policy, most recently articulated by the Legislature in 1979:\nIt is the policy of the state to promote the use of the public waters in a fashion which provides for obtaining maximum net benefits arising from both diversionary uses of the state's public waters and the retention of waters within streams and lakes in sufficient quantity and quality to protect instream and natural values and rights.\nRCW 90.03.005.\nI\nIn the early 1900's, John Fuher began operating a sawmill on the banks of Deadman Creek on property now owned by Riddle, the respondent in this appeal. The sawmill diverted water from the creek for log washing. In 1921, Fuher moved the sawmill to the opposite bank of the creek and continued to divert water. At that time, he also constructed a small pond which was continuously filled with fresh water. The sawmill continued in operation until the mid-1940's, at about which time respondents acquired the land. In August 1911, after the sawmill was already operating, Fuher filed a notice of appropriation with the Spokane County Auditor declaring his intent to divert 4.0 cubic feet per second (c.f.s.) of water for irrigation and other beneficial uses.\nSixty years later, on September 24, 1971, J. C. Riddle filed water right claim 5924, claiming the right to divert and use 4.0 c.f.s. of the waters of Deadman Creek for irrigation of 200 acres. Although the water has been used for irrigation for at least the last 15 to 20 years, the referee in a 1982 adjudication denied Riddle's claim of a water right of that quantity acquired from Fuher and confirmed a water right of a much smaller amount. The referee indicated that Fuher irrigated only about 15 acres in either 1922 or 1923. Except for the sawmill, there was no evidence of continuous use between the early 1920's and the early 1950's. The trial court, relying on Riddle's status as a riparian, granted Riddle partial summary judgment and remanded to the referee.\nIn reversing the referee, the trial judge declared that a riparian owner's common law rights to \"ordinary\" and \"natural\" (domestic) uses of water were unaffected by either the 1917 water code or the 1969 water rights act. He concluded that the right to \"ordinary\" and \"natural\" uses inheres in the ownership of the property and is neither acquired through actual usage nor lost through disuse. He also concluded that the 1917 code did not require unexer-cised riparian rights to be exercised within any particular time from the June 6, 1917 effective date, nor did it require changes in \"ordinary\" and \"natural\" use to be approved by the State.\nII\nRiparian rights, where they exist, derive from the ownership of land contiguous to or traversed by a watercourse. Crook v. Hewitt, 4 Wash. 749, 749-50, 31 P. 28 (1892) (\"the law is uniformly settled that every proprietor of lands on the bank of a river has naturally an equal right to the use of the water which flows in the stream adjacent to his lands, as it was wont to run, without diminution or alteration\"). Riparian rights in Washington can be traced to an enactment of the territorial Legislature adopting the common law of England as the rule of decision in territorial courts. See Laws of 1862, p. 82, ch. 1; see also Benton v. Johncox, 17 Wash. 277, 280-81, 49 P. 495 (1897).\nThe Washington Constitution did not mention riparian rights. As to water rights, it provides in article 21, section 1 that the \"use of the waters of this state for irrigation, mining and manufacturing purposes shall be deemed a public use.\" No specific guaranty of the vitality of the riparian rights doctrine appeared in either the 1890 or the 1891 implementing legislation. Provision for condemnation of riparian rights in the 1890 act, however, makes clear that riparian rights continued to exist. See Laws of 1889, ch. 21, p. 722, \u00a7 57. The implementing statute passed in 1891 provided:\nThe right to the use of water in any lake, pond or flowing spring in this state, or the right to the use of water flowing in any river, stream or ravine of this state for irrigation, mining or manufacturing purposes, or for supplying cities, towns or villages with water, or for water works, may be acquired by appropriation, and as between appropriations the first in time is the first in right.\nLaws of 1891, ch. 142, \u00a7 1, p. 327. Section 9 of the act read:\nWater appropriated for any of the purposes in this act mentioned may be changed to any other purpose herein specified or to any other beneficial use, and the right to such use shall relate back to the original appropriation.\nThe 1891 act also stated that \"this act shall not be construed to interfere with vested rights.\" Laws of 1891, ch. 142, \u00a7 7, p. 328.\nAppropriative rights, as provided for by statute, and riparian rights, derived from the common law, existed simultaneously. Conflict between riparian and appropriative rights was addressed as early as the first volume of Washington Reports. Geddis v. Parrish, 1 Wash. 587, 21 P. 314 (1889). The \"California\" or dual system of riparian and appropriative rights was fully recognized in our state in Benton v. Johncox, supra. There, the court recognized riparian ownership as superior to subsequent appropriation. Benton, at 288. It further decided that riparian rights date to the inception of title by the government patentee and noted the common law rule \"that every riparian proprietor has an equal right to the use of water as it is accustomed to flow, without diminution or alteration, is subject to the well recognized limitation that each owner may make a reasonable use of the water for domestic, agricultural and manufacturing purposes . . .\". Benton, at 290.\nUnder the common law, mere disuse of riparian rights did not destroy or suspend their existence. Rigney v. Tacoma Light & Water Co., 9 Wash. 576, 38 P. 147 (1894); Lux v. Haggin, 69 Cal. 255, 391, 10 P. 674 (1886). The perpetuity of the right, however, was subject to impairment or destruction through adverse use by others or creation of an estoppel against the riparian proprietor. 2 W. Hutchins, Water Rights Laws in the Nineteen Western States 25 (1974).\nStrict application of the riparian rights doctrine led to problems. The riparian rights doctrine prevented appropriative or riparian development by others, even if the riparian rights had never been exercised. As population density increased, demand for water grew and the vitality of the riparian doctrine began to wane. See Trelease, Coordination of Riparian and Appropriative Rights to the Use of Water, 33 Tex. L. Rev. 24, 25-26 (1954). In 1907, the Supreme Court upheld the 1890 statute which provided that riparian rights may be condemned for irrigation purposes, subject to the irrigation needs of the riparian. State ex rel. Kettle Falls Power & Irrig. Co. v. Superior Court, 46 Wash. 500, 90 P. 650 (1907). The condemnation statute was again at issue later that year. The court discussed the meaning and intention of the phrase \"needed for [irrigation] by any [riparian]11:\nWe think it means the water necessary to irrigate the land of the littoral or riparian owner which he now has under irrigation, and also that which he intends to, and will, place under irrigation within a reasonable time. It cannot be supposed that the legislature intended that a riparian owner could prevent an irrigating company from appropriating water not then in use but which the riparian owner might need and use upon his land at some distant, indefinite time in the future. Such a construction would be in the interest of the speculator rather than for the encouragement of the land improver and home builder. ... If [the riparian] is not using the water and does not propose to use it as soon as practicable in the ordinary and reasonable development or cultivation of his lands, then there is no reason why the water should be withheld from others who need and will promptly use it if permitted.\n(Italics ours.) State ex rel. Liberty Lk. Irrig. Co. v. Superior Court, 47 Wash. 310, 313-14, 91 P. 968 (1907).\nErosion of riparian rights as the dominant force in Washington water law continued with the enactment of the water code of 1917. Until 1917, there existed two ways for a nonriparian owner to obtain an appropriative right to water: by taking water from the public domain and putting it to beneficial use, Thorpe v. Tenem Ditch Co., 1 Wash. 566, 20 P. 588 (1889), or by posting a statutory notice at the point of diversion and commencing construction of the works. Laws of 1891, ch. 142, \u00a7 2, p. 327. The 1917 code abrogated the acts of 1890 and 1891 and provided for a new system of application, permit and certification by the supervisor of hydraulics (now the supervisor of water resources).\nThe water code of 1917 declares that, subject to existing rights, \"all waters within the state belong to the public, and any right thereto . . . shall be hereafter acquired ... in the manner provided and not otherwise . . .\". (Italics ours.) RCW 90.03.010. \"Any person . . . desiring to appropriate water for a beneficial use shall [apply] to the supervisor of water resources for a permit . . . and shall not use or divert such waters until he has received a permit . . .\". RCW 90.03.250. No exception is made for waters devoted to \"ordinary\", \"natural\" or domestic uses. There is no indication that rights which vested before the water code were to be excluded from general water rights adjudications or otherwise treated differently. For example, RCW 90.03.120 calls for service in an adjudication of \"all known persons claiming the right to divert the water involved . . .\". No distinction is made as to the kind of use.\nNothing in the 1917 water code \"shall be construed to lessen, enlarge, or modify the existing rights of any riparian owner, or any existing right acquired by appropriation, or otherwise.\" (Italics ours.) RCW 90.03.010. The code also continued and enlarged condemnation rights by giving any person the power to condemn an inferior use for a superior beneficial use. RCW 90.03.040. Shortly after adoption of the code, the Supreme Court held that a riparian owner intending future use could not prevent condemnation by a nonriparian owner for an immediate use for power. State ex rel. South Fork Log Driving Co. v. Superior Court, 102 Wash. 460, 470, 173 P. 192 (1918) (the test for condemnation is \"the extent and manner of the proposed use as compared with the present use\"). Finally, the 1917 water code required that a change in use of all pre-code vested rights must be approved by the supervisor of hydraulics. RCW 90.03.380.\nThe trial judge in this case, despite the shift away from the primacy of riparian rights by the courts and Legislature, concluded that the appropriative permit system embodied in the 1917 water code applied only to surplus waters in excess of those required for \"ordinary\" or \"natural\" domestic uses by riparians. He also interpreted the forfeiture provisions of the water rights act as applying only to public uses enumerated in article 1, section 16 of the state constitution. Although we need not decide questions concerning that here, even partial adoption of the trial court opinion would effectively create a domestic use exemption from the permit system and state management of water resources. The Legislature did expressly create a domestic exemption in the groundwater code, RCW 90.44-.050, but it has never seen fit to create such an exemption for surface water.\nWe cannot agree with the trial court's conclusion. The trial judge relied on two decisions subsequent to the 1917 water code in concluding that domestic uses did not fall within the purview of the code. Yet, we believe neither of those cases reached that question. Brown v. Chase, 125 Wash. 542, 217 P. 23 (1923) and Proctor v. Sim, 134 Wash. 606, 236 P. 114 (1925) were both concerned with determining whether the clause in the 1917 code protecting the \"existing rights\" of riparian owners, see RCW 90.03.010, applied to unused rights.\nWhether unused riparian rights survived adoption of the use-oriented 1917 water code has been much discussed. See Horowitz, Riparian and Appropriation Rights to the Use of Water in Washington, 7 Wash. L. Rev. 197 (1932); Morris, Washington Water Rights \u2014 A Sketch, 31 Wash. L. Rev. 243 (1956); Johnson, Riparian and Public Rights to Lakes and Streams, 35 Wash. L. Rev. 580 (1960); Corker & Roe, Washington's New Water Rights Law \u2014 Improvements Needed, 44 Wash. L. Rev. 85 (1968). The referee in this case determined that the \"[e]xtent of the right is limited to the amount of water developed and used under diligent pursuance and completion of any project as originally contemplated and which was initiated within three years after the effective date of the 1917 Surface Water Code. (June 6, 1917)\". Report of Referee, at 15.\nBrown v. Chase, supra, presented a contest between riparians whose rights were unexercised and an applicant for an appropriation permit under the 1917 water code. The trial court overturned a permit on the grounds that a riparian owner is entitled to \"the undiminished unpolluted flow of the stream past his land.\" In reversing the trial court, the Supreme Court adopted the approach taken in Kettle Falls Power, and stated:\n[I]n consonance with the general needs and welfare of the state, especially in the arid and semi-arid regions, and in harmony with the legislation upon the matter, we are now prepared to declare . . . that (1) waters of non-navigable streams in excess of the amount which can be beneficially used, either directly or prospectively, within a reasonable time, on, or in connection with riparian lands, are subject to appropriation for use on non-riparian lands.\n(Italics ours.) 125 Wash, at 553, 217 P. at 26-27.\nProctor v. Sim, supra, involved a situation similar to that in Brown v. Chase, supra. The riparian rights concerned derived from ownership of land bordering a nonnavigable lake. The court reasoned, \" [i]t would seem a waste of energy to compel the surplus waters of a stream to labor on arid lands and at the same time permit surplus waters of a lake to lie idle.\" Proctor, 134 Wash, at 619. Read in isolation, attempting to support preferential treatment for domestic use, one might conclude that a substantive difference in the nature of \"surplus\" waters actually exists. However, review of the opinion shows that the term \"surplus\" refers to those waters not already put to use by the riparian. The court determined that the \"existing rights\" which the water code protected referred to \"the right to the beneficial use of such portions of the waters ... as are either directly or prospectively, within a reasonable time, proper and necessary for the irrigation of their lands and for the usual domestic purposes.\" Proctor v. Sim, supra at 615-16.\nBrown v. Chase, supra, and Proctor v. Sim, supra, are not surprising decisions when viewed in light of the movement toward use-oriented rights. In a dual system, nonuse of any riparian rights results in their forfeiture. J. Sax, Water Law, Planning and Policy 287 (1968); see State v. American Fruit Growers, Inc., 135 Wash. 156, 237 P. 498 (1925). On the other hand, Brown v. Chase, supra, and Proctor v. Sim, supra, both imply that the code did not extinguish unused water rights as of 1917 but as of a later date, adequate to allow riparian owners to learn about the code and take steps to protect their interests. Many commentators, and several courts, have determined that either the statute or the decisional law of this court has eliminated unused riparian rights. Disagreement, however, is widespread as to when that relinquishment occurred. See Corker & Roe, 44 Wash. L. Rev. at 114-18; see also 2 W. Hutchins, Water Rights Laws in the Nineteen Western States 14 (1974). The time when relinquishment occurred must be settled to decide today's case.\nSix years after Proctor v. Sim, supra, was decided, four members of Department One of this court agreed that a claim to riparian rights which had not and would not be exercised \"within a reasonable time\" was properly rejected by a trial court reviewing an adjudication. In re Sinlahekin Creek, 162 Wash. 635, 299 P. 649 (1931). Because Sinlahekin Creek and the other cases applying the \"reasonable time\" standard are all forward looking, the Department of Ecology suggests 1932 as the date by which unused riparian rights must have been put to use or forfeited. Our cases support adoption of that year as the cutoff date for exercise of unused riparian rights; 15 years after enactment of the water code, we now hold, as a matter of law, constitutes adequate notice.\nThe referee's denial of Riddle's claim based on Fuher's riparian status was proper. No rights sought were exercised for irrigation purposes prior to 1917. Fuher lost his claim to these unexercised riparian rights by 1932 and therefore transferred only those exercised to Riddle.\nRespondents assert that the sawmill use through the 1940's, along with their predecessor's irrigation use, supports retention of a right based on Fuher's beneficial use. Generally, an appropriator is not limited to the use for which the appropriation was initially made. See In re Alpowa Creek, 129 Wash. 9, 224 P. 29 (1924).\nSince 1917, however, by statute changes in use must first be approved by the supervisor of water resources. In this case, a change in use from log washing to irrigation should be allowed only if an application to do so was filed with and approved by the supervisor of water resources. Neither Fuher nor Riddle appears to have sought approval for the change in use.\nIll\nRiddle asserts that the forfeiture of riparian rights for nonuse effects an unconstitutional taking. In Washington, we have previously held that the permit requirement for bringing a water right into existence in the first instance is a reasonable exercise of the State's police power. Peterson v. Department of Ecology, 92 Wn.2d 306, 596 P.2d 285 (1979). In other states, it is well established that riparian rights may be extinguished or limited by statute. 2 W. Hutchins, at 290-97. That a state has the power to either modify or reject the doctrine of riparian rights because unsuited to the conditions in the state and to put into effect the doctrine of prior appropriation has long been settled. See, e.g., Baumann v. Smrha, 145 F. Supp. 617, 624 (D. Kan.), aff'd, 352 U.S. 863 (1956); In re Water Rights of Hood River, 114 Or. 112, 227 P. 1065 (1924).\nNeither the Legislature nor our courts have gone so far as to eliminate riparian rights, as other states have. Consumptive, recreational and aesthetic riparian rights are considered to be vested property rights. Department of Ecology v. Acquavella, 100 Wn.2d 651, 674 P.2d 160 (1983); Bach v. Sarich, 74 Wn.2d 575, 445 P.2d 648 (1968); In re Clinton Water Dist., 36 Wn.2d 284, 218 P.2d 309 (1950). They may not be taken by inverse condemnation or by zoning. See, e.g., Bach v. Sarich, supra. Riparian rights may be limited, however, in order to further state policy encouraging beneficial use. See, e.g., State ex rel. South Fork Log Driving Co. v. Superior Court, supra.\nWashington is not the only state which provides for the forfeiture of unused riparian rights. The State of Texas also allows termination of riparian rights for nonuse through exercise of the police power. In re Adjudication of Water Rights, 642 S.W.2d 438, 444-46 (Tex. 1982). In addition, several states allow termination of groundwater rights for nonuse without requiring compensation. Chino Vly. v. Prescott, 131 Ariz. 78, 84, 638 P.2d 1324, 1329 (1981); Williams v. Wichita, 190 Kan. 317, 340-41, 374 P.2d 578, 595-96 (1962), appeal dismissed, 375 U.S. 7, 11 L. Ed. 2d 38, 84 S. Ct. 46 (1963); Baeth v. Hoisveen, 157 N.W.2d 728, 733 (N.D. 1968); Knight v. Grimes, 80 S.D. 517, 523-27, 127 N.W.2d 708, 711-14 (1964).\nThere has been no unconstitutional taking. The steady and gradual evolution toward prior appropriation by the court and the Legislature in the early days of statehood, culminating in the 1917 water code and the cases following from it, constituted sufficient notice and opportunity for exercise of unused riparian rights so that no compensable taking occurred by the reversion of unused riparian rights to the State.\nIV\nThe Department of Ecology asserts the trial judge misunderstood the purpose of statutory minimum instream flow. The Department and the trial judge appear to disagree whether nondiversionary stock watering rights may be determined in an adjudication. Case law supports the conclusion that stock watering rights may properly be determined in an adjudication. See, e.g., In re Stranger Creek, 77 Wn.2d 649, 466 P.2d 508 (1970).\nV\nThe summary judgment of the trial court is reversed and remanded in light of the determinations above. The Riddles' request for attorney's fees is denied.\nWilliams, C.J., Brachtenbach, Dolliver, Dore, Dim-mick, Pearson, and Andersen, JJ., and Cunningham, J. Pro Tern., concur.\nAs to a water right by prior appropriation, based on Fuher's August 1911 Notice of Water Right, the finder of fact must determine whether the irrigation appropriation was actually completed with due diligence. See Sander v. Bull, 76 Wash. 1, 4, 135 P. 489 (1913) (\" [appropriation of water consists in an intention to appropriate followed by reasonable diligence in applying the water to a beneficial use\"). A notice filed under the 1891 law is only a statement of intention and not proof that what was intended was, in fact, done. See Laws of 1891, ch. 142, \u00a7 3, p. 328. Here, at least 50 years were taken to perfect the right from the time of posting to its present level of use. The referee thus limited the right acquired to the number of acres shown to have been irrigated by the early 1920's (and to a rate of withdrawal commensurate with such usage).",

    "\u00b61 The common enemy rule, which allows landowners to repel surface waters to the detriment of their neighbors, does not apply when the landowner obstructs a watercourse or natural drainway or when the landowner obstructs riparian water from entering a flood channel. Currens v. Sleek, 138 Wn.2d 858, 862-63, 983 P.2d 626, 993 P.2d 900 (1999); Sund v. Keating, 43 Wn.2d 36, 42-43, 259 P.2d 1113 (1953). Landowners appeal summary dismissal of their inverse condemnation claim. They claim that a dike owned, constructed, maintained, and modified by government entities blocked side channels through which high waters would have otherwise flowed. The landowners presented evidence that the dike caused high waters flowing down the river to change the course of the channel and swept their land and home down the river. We conclude that they have presented material issues of fact that preclude summary judgment. We therefore reverse and remand.\nSchultheis, J.\nFACTS\n\u00b62 Siblings Heather Fitzpatrick Sturgill and Don L. Fitzpatrick (the landowners) acquired property along the Methow River in Mazama, Washington, in the early 1980s. They built a log home and garage in the mid 1980s. Prior to June 16, 2002, the channel alignment of the Methow River was generally southwest and away from plaintiffs\u2019 property. Their home was 80 to 100 feet from the Methow River, which was outside of the 100-year flood line.\n\u00b63 On June 16, during a two-year storm event, the river avulsed \u2014 the channel changed course very quickly and resulted in a new channel alignment separate from the previous channel alignment. The change in channel alignment caused a substantial force of water to be redirected straight at the landowners\u2019 property, resulting in a rapid erosion of the land and ultimately causing their house to collapse into the river. The landowners permanently lost their home, its contents, and a significant portion of land. The garage is now located immediately along the edge of the new riverbank.\n\u00b64 The landowners filed an action against the State of Washington and Okanogan County, claiming that the government entities\u2019 construction of a dike upstream from their property caused the avulsion and the loss of their home.\n\u00b65 The government entities each moved for summary dismissal of the landowners\u2019 action. The landowners responded with evidence that, sometime around 1975, the county and the state sponsored and constructed the Sloan-Witchert Slough Dike along the Methow River\u2019s downstream right bank, approximately one and one half miles upstream from the landowners\u2019 property. The dike was constructed as a public project to defend Washington State Highway 20, the Weeman Bridge, and several private properties from flooding. The dike was subsequently repaired and/or extended between 1978 and 1999.\n\u00b66 The landowners also presented evidence through Jeffrey Bradley, PhD, a water resource management expert, that the avulsion was caused by the dike\u2019s blockage of natural side channels, which would have relieved the flow of water in the river and prevented the landowners\u2019 loss. The landowners asserted that the evidence presented genuine issues of material fact. The trial court granted summary dismissal.\nDISCUSSION\n\u00b67 Summary judgment is properly granted if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Phillips v. King County, 136 Wn.2d 946, 956, 968 P.2d 871 (1998); CR 56(c). The motion should be granted only if, from all the evidence, a reasonable person could reach only one conclusion. Folsom v. Burger King, 135 Wn.2d 658, 663, 958 P.2d 301 (1998).\n\u00b68 We review motions for summary judgment de novo, engaging in the same inquiry as the trial court, which is to treat all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the landowners, as the nonmoving party. Phillips, 136 Wn.2d at 956. The government entities, as the moving party, have the burden to demonstrate the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact, with all reasonable inferences resolved against them. Folsom, 135 Wn.2d at 663.\n\u00b69 If there is a dispute regarding the \u201cnature or classification\u201d of the water at issue, it is a question of fact and therefore improper for resolution on summary judgment. Snohomish County v. Postema, 95 Wn. App. 817, 820, 978 P.2d 1101 (1998). Similarly, \u201c[w]hen a question is raised as to the existence of a natural watercourse, that question must be determined by the trier of fact.\u201d Buxel v. King County, 60 Wn.2d 404, 408, 374 P.2d 250 (1962) (citing Tierney v. Yakima County, 136 Wash. 481, 239 P. 248 (1925)). That is precisely the issue here.\nCommon Enemy Doctrine\n\u00b610 Washington courts have recognized this common law rule in some form for more than a century, which recognizes that \u201csurface water, caused by the falling of rain or the melting of snow, and that escaping from running streams and rivers, is regarded as an outlaw and a common enemy against which anyone may defend himself, even though by so doing injury may result to others.\u201d Cass v. Dicks, 14 Wash. 75, 78, 44 P. 113 (1896). Because its strict application has proved inequitable, our courts have developed exceptions to the common enemy rule. Currens, 138 Wn.2d at 861-62.\n\u00b611 Washington\u2019s common enemy doctrine \u201callows landowners to alter the flow of surface water to the detriment of their neighbors, so long as they do not block a watercourse or natural drainway.\u201d Id. at 862-63. Landowners are not shielded from liability if they dam up a stream, gully, or drainway, because \u201c[a] natural drainway must be kept open to carry water into streams and lakes.\u201d Id. at 862 (citing 78 Am. Jur. 2d Waters \u00a7 134 (1975)).\n\u00b612 The landowners have presented evidence that the waters held back by the dike would have otherwise flowed through natural side channels and rejoined the river. The government entities argue that the common enemy doctrine insulates upstream landowners, as a matter of law, from damage caused by diking because the watercourse/drainway obstruction rule does not apply to diking. The government entities rely largely on Halverson v. Skagit County, 139 Wn.2d 1, 983 P.2d 643 (1999).\n\u00b613 In Halverson, the landowners\u2019 properties along the Skagit River were flood-damaged, which they claimed was exacerbated by the presence of levees along the river. Our Supreme Court reversed the judgment because, in part, the common enemy doctrine provided a complete defense to the county\u2019s liability and the trial court failed to properly instruct the jury on the doctrine. Halverson, 139 Wn.2d at 13-14.\n\u00b614 The landowners in this case properly point out that the overbank floodwaters in Halverson did not flow within a defined flood channel. Id. at 14 n.14. The Halverson court implied that if there were such evidence, it would apply an aspect of the doctrine expressed in Sund, in which case it would reach a different result. Id. (citing Sund, 43 Wn.2d at 42-46).\n\u00b615 We also find Sund to be persuasive authority. There, the court examined the character that water assumes when it overflows a riverbank in times of flooding. Sund, 43 Wn.2d at 41-43. The government entities correctly point out that our courts have held that such water is surface water \u2014 against which they are entitled to protect themselves under the common enemy doctrine. Halverson, 139 Wn.2d at 14-15; Sund, 43 Wn.2d at 41-42 (citing Cass, 14 Wash. 75; Harvey v. N. Pac. Ry., 63 Wash. 669, 116 P. 464 (1911); Morton v. Hines, 112 Wash. 612, 192 P. 1016 (1920); DeRuwe v. Morrison, 28 Wn.2d 797, 184 P.2d 273 (1947)).\n\u00b616 However, the Sund court declared: \u201cThe weight of authority inclines to the view that surface water, which has joined the course of a stream and has become subject to its current, ceases to possess the characteristics of diffused or vagrant surface waters and becomes part of the stream.\u201d Sund, 43 Wn.2d at 42; accord Halverson, 139 Wn.2d at 14-15; Marshland Flood Control Dist. of Snohomish County v. Great N. Ry., 71 Wn.2d 365, 369-70, 428 P.2d 531 (1967). Under the facts in Sund, the court held that the law of riparian water imposed liability to a landowner whose excavation near the bank of a stream caused the stream to change its course. Sund, 43 Wn.2d at 42; see also Great N. Ry., 71 Wn.2d at 369-70.\n\u00b617 In Sund, the stream was normally about 15 to 20 feet wide and 18 inches deep. Sund, 43 Wn.2d at 38. The riparian landowner\u2019s excavation, which interfered with a natural barrier that had served to keep floodwaters in check, was \u201cfifty to sixty feet north of the north margin of [the stream].\u201d Id. The flood channel included the land between the stream\u2019s bank and the natural barrier, which served as the bank of the flood channel. Id.\n\u00b618 Here, the landowners\u2019 expert stated that the side channels were a part of the floodplain and the dikes interfered with natural high flow to these side channels. Though the government entities did not counter this evidence, the state characterizes the side channels as \u201cmerely depressions in the floodplain that carry water only in high water events.\u201d State\u2019s Br. at 13. To the contrary, as the landowners point out, a memorandum authored by a state hydrologist with the Department of Ecology reads:\nThis road and dike work has impacted the Methow River by cutting off at least three natural overflow channels in the floodplain, thereby compressing more flood flow into the main channel and reducing the natural flood conveyance capacity of the river. Overall this work has cut off about a mile of overflow channels. Additional velocity and quantities of high flows compressed into the main channel during floods are disrupting the natural bed form of the river and causing additional erosion and scour of the main channel downstream.\nClerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 254-55.\n\u00b619 The character of the water is an issue of fact. The landowners have presented an issue of material fact as to the existence of circumstances under which the legal rule in Sund would apply:\n[I]f the waters were in the flood channel of a stream, then certain principles become self-evident: (a) They are properly classified as riparian waters rather than surface waters; (b) being riparian waters, the rules relating to watercourses would apply. ... As a consequence of the applicability of the law of riparian waters, appellants in the case at bar could neither intentionally nor negligently disturb the channel of the stream for their own purposes or to flood respondents\u2019 land; nor could they interfere with the flood channel of the stream \u2014 for that, also, is properly regarded as part of the stream.\nSund, 43 Wn.2d at 44-45 (citation omitted).\n\u00b620 The government entities insist that Sund does not apply because in that case the parties were adjoining landowners disputing the flood channel of a stream, but here the landowners do not have riparian rights to waters in the stream that the government entities obstructed. We are not persuaded.\n\u00b621 We agree that when riparian rights exist, they derive from the ownership of land contiguous to or traversed by a watercourse. Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Abbott, 103 Wn.2d 686, 689, 694 P.2d 1071 (1985). However, it is important to note that the Sund court adopted the following language it quoted from a water rights treatise:\n\u201cEvery stream flowing through a country subject to a changeable climate must have periods of high and low water. And it must have, not only its ordinary channel which carries the water in ordinary times, but it must have, also, its flood channel to accommodate the water when additional quantities find their way into the stream. The flood channel of the stream is as much a natural part of it as is the ordinary channel. It is provided by nature, and it is necessary to the safe discharge of the volume of water. With this flood channel no one is permitted to interfere to the injury of other riparian owners.... Thus, the courts are very nearly agreed that the flood channel must be considered as a part of the channel of the stream, and that no structures or obstructions of any kind can be placed in its bed which will have a tendency to dam the water back upon the property of the upper riparian owner.\u201d\nSund, 43 Wn.2d at 43 (emphasis added and omitted) (alteration in original) (quoting 3 Henry Philip Farnham, Waters and Water Rights \u00a7 880, at 2561-62 (1904)). The landowners\u2019 property is situated on the Methow River, which affords them standing.\n\u00b622 Sund also relied on O\u2019Connell v. East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia Railway, 87 Ga. 246, 13 S.E. 489, 490 (1891), which held that because floodwaters were not surface waters, a flood channel cannot be obstructed without incurring liability. The Georgia court distinguished between surface water and floodwater:\n\u201cIf the flood water becomes severed from the main current, or leaves the stream never to return, and spreads out over the lower ground, it has become surface water. But if it forms a continuous body with the water flowing in the ordinary channel, or if it departs from such channel animo revertendi, presently to return, as by the recession of the waters, it is to be regarded as still a part of the river.\u201d\nSund, 43 Wn.2d at 43 (quoting O\u2019Connell, 13 S.E. at 489).\n\u00b623 The O\u2019Connell court agreed with the Farnham treatise, supra, and other authorities in holding that the volume of water due to seasonal flow does not define a river or its flood channels, where these points in the river \u201cact as natural safety-valves in times of freshet.\u201d O\u2019Connell, 13 S.E. at 489.\n\u00b624 The landowners presented evidence that the side channel drainways identified by its expert constituted flood channels under Sund. Such water cannot be blocked as surface water because it is part of the waterway. And waterways cannot be blocked. Conger v. Pierce County, 116 Wash. 27, 198 P. 377 (1921).\n\u00b625 The county concedes that \u201c \u2018even though a downhill landowner can lawfully repel surface water from his or her land, it must be done without blocking a natural water course or drainway.\u2019 \u201d County\u2019s Br. at 14 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Colwell v. Etzell, 119 Wn. App. 432, 441, 81 P.3d 895 (2003)). But it claims that liability attaches only to downstream owners who damage the property of upstream landowners by backed-up water. E.g., Currens, 138 Wn.2d at 862. It is true that the only cases presented by the parties involve those factual circumstances. But the government entities provide no authority expressly stating, and no argument as to why, the rule applies only under those circumstances.\nf 26 In fact, Conger held that the state and county could not be relieved from liability to downstream owners when it straightened a waterway, causing the course of the river\u2019s current to shift and erode the downstream landowners\u2019 property. Conger, 116 Wash, at 42; see also Great N. Ry., 71 Wn.2d 365 (finding liability for damage to railroad bridge from increased water flow in the waterway due to diking).\nImmunity\n\u00b627 The county claims it has immunity from the damages sought here. RCW 86.12.020 authorizes counties to construct and maintain dikes and levees to protect against floods. RCW 86.12.037 provides: \u201cNo action shall be brought. . . against any county ... for any noncontractual acts or omissions . . . relating to the improvement, protection, regulation and control for flood prevention and navigation purposes of any river or its tributaries and the beds, banks and waters thereof.\u201d\n\u00b628 RCW 86.12.037 was enacted to shield counties from liability for their efforts to protect the public from flood damage. Short v. Pierce County, 194 Wash. 421, 430-31, 78 P.2d 610 (1938). The statute provides immunity to counties where their negligence in the construction and maintenance of flood control devices results in damage to private property during floods or other periods of high water. Id. at 431.\n\u00b629 Similarly, the state argues that it is immune. RCW 86.16.071 provides: \u201cThe exercise by the state of the authority, duties, and responsibilities as provided in this chapter [flood plain management] shall not imply or create any liability for any damages against the state.\u201d Damages include harmful inundation, water erosion of soil, stream banks and beds, and stream channel shifting. RCW 86.16.120.\n\u00b630 The landowners correctly note that the immunity does not extend to an unconstitutional taking. In Paulson v. County of Pierce, 99 Wn.2d 645, 652, 664 P.2d 1202 (1983), the court held that because RCW 86.12.037 does not affect fundamental rights, it does not prohibit recovery under the takings provision of our state constitution, article I, section 16. Accord Halverson, 139 Wn.2d at 12; see also Conger, 116 Wash, at 38-40. The county disregards that portion of the opinion and argues only the facts of Paulson: that the county was found to be immune from liability for damages caused by a breach of the levy. Paulson was clearly a tort action. Paulson, 99 Wn.2d at 649, 650-51.\n\u00b631 The same is true for Short, also relied upon by the county. In Short, the landowners alleged that because the county failed to properly repair a break in a bulkhead with cement, choosing instead to fill the hole with stakes and brush, the wall gave way and the rushing water eroded two acres of the landowners\u2019 topsoil. Short, 194 Wash, at 428-29. The court held that the immunity statute applied to that claim. Id. at 430.\n\u00b632 The governmental entities also rely on Halverson, which they assert holds that tort immunity is inapplicable only when the alleged violation is based solely on constitutional grounds, and they assert that the immunity applies here because the landowners have pleaded tort claims as well as constitutional claims.\n\u00b633 In Halverson, the court discussed a \u201chybrid\u201d tort and inverse condemnation claim. Halverson, 139 Wn.2d at 11-12. But that was in the context of whether the county could be held liable under the tort concept of joint and several liability. Id. at 11. The landowners did not introduce such a hybrid concept here.\n\u00b634 The governmental entities incorrectly assert that because the landowners claim that the entities negligently constructed the dike in the wrong location, their takings action is actually a tort action, to which it is immune as in Short. The landowners\u2019 claim is for blocking a natural drainway or flood channel. Negligence is not an issue.\nInverse Condemnation\n\u00b635 Article I, section 16 of the Washington Constitution prohibits the taking or damaging of private property without just compensation. The Washington Supreme Court has interpreted this provision to allow a landowner to bring an inverse condemnation action to \u201c \u2018recover the value of property which has been appropriated in fact, but with no formal exercise of [condemnation] power.\u2019 \u201d Pierce v. Ne. Lake Wash. Sewer & Water Dist., 123 Wn.2d 550, 556, 870 P.2d 305 (1994) (alteration in original) (quoting Martin v. Port of Seattle, 64 Wn.2d 309, 310 n.1, 391 P.2d 540 (1964)).\n\u00b636 The elements of inverse condemnation are: \u201c(1) a taking or damaging (2) of private property (3) for public use (4) without just compensation being paid (5) by a governmental entity that has not instituted formal proceedings.\u201d Phillips, 136 Wn.2d at 957. \u201cThe taking or damaging of property to the extent that it is reasonably necessary for the maintenance and operation of other property devoted to a public use is a taking or damaging for a public use and subject to the provisions of article I, section 16, of the Washington State Constitution.\u201d Dickgieser v. State, 153 Wn.2d 530, 535, 105 P.3d 26 (2005).\n\u00b637 The parties generally agree that a takings claim can lie for damages that are \u201cnecessarily incident to\u201d or a \u201cnecessary consequence of\u201d a public project. State\u2019s Br. at 16-17; County\u2019s Br. at 25-26; Appellants\u2019 Br. at 8-11. But the government entities assert that their actions do not constitute a taking because the damage to the landowner",

Landowners are not shielded from liability if they dam up a stream, gully, or drainway, because \u201c[a] natural drainway must be kept open to carry water into streams and lakes.\u201d Id. at 862 (citing 78 Am. Jur. 2d Waters \u00a7 134 (1975)).\n\u00b612 The landowners have presented evidence that the waters held back by the dike would have otherwise flowed through natural side channels and rejoined the river. The government entities argue that the common enemy doctrine insulates upstream landowners, as a matter of law, from damage caused by diking because the watercourse/drainway obstruction rule does not apply to diking. The government entities rely largely on Halverson v. Skagit County, 139 Wn.2d 1, 983 P.2d 643 (1999).\n\u00b613 In Halverson, the landowners\u2019 properties along the Skagit River were flood-damaged, which they claimed was exacerbated by the presence of levees along the river. Our Supreme Court reversed the judgment because, in part, the common enemy doctrine provided a complete defense to the county\u2019s liability and the trial court failed to properly instruct the jury on the doctrine. Halverson, 139 Wn.2d at 13-14.\n\u00b614 The landowners in this case properly point out that the overbank floodwaters in Halverson did not flow within a defined flood channel. Id. at 14 n.14. The Halverson court implied that if there were such evidence, it would apply an aspect of the doctrine expressed in Sund, in which case it would reach a different result. Id. (citing Sund, 43 Wn.2d at 42-46).\n\u00b615 We also find Sund to be persuasive authority. There, the court examined the character that water assumes when it overflows a riverbank in times of flooding. Sund, 43 Wn.2d at 41-43. The government entities correctly point out that our courts have held that such water is surface water \u2014 against which they are entitled to protect themselves under the common enemy doctrine. Halverson, 139 Wn.2d at 14-15; Sund, 43 Wn.2d at 41-42 (citing Cass, 14 Wash. 75; Harvey v. N. Pac. Ry., 63 Wash. 669, 116 P. 464 (1911); Morton v. Hines, 112 Wash. 612, 192 P. 1016 (1920); DeRuwe v. Morrison, 28 Wn.2d 797, 184 P.2d 273 (1947)).\n\u00b616 However, the Sund court declared: \u201cThe weight of authority inclines to the view that surface water, which has joined the course of a stream and has become subject to its current, ceases to possess the characteristics of diffused or vagrant surface waters and becomes part of the stream.\u201d Sund, 43 Wn.2d at 42; accord Halverson, 139 Wn.2d at 14-15; Marshland Flood Control Dist. of Snohomish County v. Great N. Ry., 71 Wn.2d 365, 369-70, 428 P.2d 531 (1967). Under the facts in Sund, the court held that the law of riparian water imposed liability to a landowner whose excavation near the bank of a stream caused the stream to change its course. Sund, 43 Wn.2d at 42; see also Great N. Ry., 71 Wn.2d at 369-70.\n\u00b617 In Sund, the stream was normally about 15 to 20 feet wide and 18 inches deep. Sund, 43 Wn.2d at 38. The riparian landowner\u2019s excavation, which interfered with a natural barrier that had served to keep floodwaters in check, was \u201cfifty to sixty feet north of the north margin of [the stream].\u201d Id. The flood channel included the land between the stream\u2019s bank and the natural barrier, which served as the bank of the flood channel. Id.\n\u00b618 Here, the landowners\u2019 expert stated that the side channels were a part of the floodplain and the dikes interfered with natural high flow to these side channels. Though the government entities did not counter this evidence, the state characterizes the side channels as \u201cmerely depressions in the floodplain that carry water only in high water events.\u201d State\u2019s Br. at 13. To the contrary, as the landowners point out, a memorandum authored by a state hydrologist with the Department of Ecology reads:\nThis road and dike work has impacted the Methow River by cutting off at least three natural overflow channels in the floodplain, thereby compressing more flood flow into the main channel and reducing the natural flood conveyance capacity of the river. Overall this work has cut off about a mile of overflow channels. Additional velocity and quantities of high flows compressed into the main channel during floods are disrupting the natural bed form of the river and causing additional erosion and scour of the main channel downstream.\nClerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 254-55.\n\u00b619 The character of the water is an issue of fact. The landowners have presented an issue of material fact as to the existence of circumstances under which the legal rule in Sund would apply:\n[I]f the waters were in the flood channel of a stream, then certain principles become self-evident: (a) They are properly classified as riparian waters rather than surface waters; (b) being riparian waters, the rules relating to watercourses would apply. ... As a consequence of the applicability of the law of riparian waters, appellants in the case at bar could neither intentionally nor negligently disturb the channel of the stream for their own purposes or to flood respondents\u2019 land; nor could they interfere with the flood channel of the stream \u2014 for that, also, is properly regarded as part of the stream.\nSund, 43 Wn.2d at 44-45 (citation omitted).\n\u00b620 The government entities insist that Sund does not apply because in that case the parties were adjoining landowners disputing the flood channel of a stream, but here the landowners do not have riparian rights to waters in the stream that the government entities obstructed. We are not persuaded.\n\u00b621 We agree that when riparian rights exist, they derive from the ownership of land contiguous to or traversed by a watercourse. Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Abbott, 103 Wn.2d 686, 689, 694 P.2d 1071 (1985). However, it is important to note that the Sund court adopted the following language it quoted from a water rights treatise:\n\u201cEvery stream flowing through a country subject to a changeable climate must have periods of high and low water. And it must have, not only its ordinary channel which carries the water in ordinary times, but it must have, also, its flood channel to accommodate the water when additional quantities find their way into the stream. The flood channel of the stream is as much a natural part of it as is the ordinary channel. It is provided by nature, and it is necessary to the safe discharge of the volume of water. With this flood channel no one is permitted to interfere to the injury of other riparian owners.... Thus, the courts are very nearly agreed that the flood channel must be considered as a part of the channel of the stream, and that no structures or obstructions of any kind can be placed in its bed which will have a tendency to dam the water back upon the property of the upper riparian owner.\u201d\nSund, 43 Wn.2d at 43 (emphasis added and omitted) (alteration in original) (quoting 3 Henry Philip Farnham, Waters and Water Rights \u00a7 880, at 2561-62 (1904)). The landowners\u2019 property is situated on the Methow River, which affords them standing.\n\u00b622 Sund also relied on O\u2019Connell v. East Tennessee, Virginia & Georgia Railway, 87 Ga. 246, 13 S.E. 489, 490 (1891), which held that because floodwaters were not surface waters, a flood channel cannot be obstructed without incurring liability. The Georgia court distinguished between surface water and floodwater:\n\u201cIf the flood water becomes severed from the main current, or leaves the stream never to return, and spreads out over the lower ground, it has become surface water. But if it forms a continuous body with the water flowing in the ordinary channel, or if it departs from such channel animo revertendi, presently to return, as by the recession of the waters, it is to be regarded as still a part of the river.\u201d\nSund, 43 Wn.2d at 43 (quoting O\u2019Connell, 13 S.E. at 489).\n\u00b623 The O\u2019Connell court agreed with the Farnham treatise, supra, and other authorities in holding that the volume of water due to seasonal flow does not define a river or its flood channels, where these points in the river \u201cact as natural safety-valves in times of freshet.\u201d O\u2019Connell, 13 S.E. at 489.\n\u00b624 The landowners presented evidence that the side channel drainways identified by its expert constituted flood channels under Sund. Such water cannot be blocked as surface water because it is part of the waterway. And waterways cannot be blocked. Conger v. Pierce County, 116 Wash. 27, 198 P. 377 (1921).\n\u00b625 The county concedes that \u201c \u2018even though a downhill landowner can lawfully repel surface water from his or her land, it must be done without blocking a natural water course or drainway.\u2019 \u201d County\u2019s Br. at 14 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Colwell v. Etzell, 119 Wn. App. 432, 441, 81 P.3d 895 (2003)). But it claims that liability attaches only to downstream owners who damage the property of upstream landowners by backed-up water. E.g., Currens, 138 Wn.2d at 862. It is true that the only cases presented by the parties involve those factual circumstances. But the government entities provide no authority expressly stating, and no argument as to why, the rule applies only under those circumstances.\nf 26 In fact, Conger held that the state and county could not be relieved from liability to downstream owners when it straightened a waterway, causing the course of the river\u2019s current to shift and erode the downstream landowners\u2019 property. Conger, 116 Wash, at 42; see also Great N. Ry., 71 Wn.2d 365 (finding liability for damage to railroad bridge from increased water flow in the waterway due to diking).\nImmunity\n\u00b627 The county claims it has immunity from the damages sought here. RCW 86.12.020 authorizes counties to construct and maintain dikes and levees to protect against floods. RCW 86.12.037 provides: \u201cNo action shall be brought. . . against any county ... for any noncontractual acts or omissions . . . relating to the improvement, protection, regulation and control for flood prevention and navigation purposes of any river or its tributaries and the beds, banks and waters thereof.\u201d\n\u00b628 RCW 86.12.037 was enacted to shield counties from liability for their efforts to protect the public from flood damage. Short v. Pierce County, 194 Wash. 421, 430-31, 78 P.2d 610 (1938). The statute provides immunity to counties where their negligence in the construction and maintenance of flood control devices results in damage to private property during floods or other periods of high water. Id. at 431.\n\u00b629 Similarly, the state argues that it is immune. RCW 86.16.071 provides: \u201cThe exercise by the state of the authority, duties, and responsibilities as provided in this chapter [flood plain management] shall not imply or create any liability for any damages against the state.\u201d Damages include harmful inundation, water erosion of soil, stream banks and beds, and stream channel shifting. RCW 86.16.120.\n\u00b630 The landowners correctly note that the immunity does not extend to an unconstitutional taking. In Paulson v. County of Pierce, 99 Wn.2d 645, 652, 664 P.2d 1202 (1983), the court held that because RCW 86.12.037 does not affect fundamental rights, it does not prohibit recovery under the takings provision of our state constitution, article I, section 16. Accord Halverson, 139 Wn.2d at 12; see also Conger, 116 Wash, at 38-40. The county disregards that portion of the opinion and argues only the facts of Paulson: that the county was found to be immune from liability for damages caused by a breach of the levy. Paulson was clearly a tort action. Paulson, 99 Wn.2d at 649, 650-51.\n\u00b631 The same is true for Short, also relied upon by the county. In Short, the landowners alleged that because the county failed to properly repair a break in a bulkhead with cement, choosing instead to fill the hole with stakes and brush, the wall gave way and the rushing water eroded two acres of the landowners\u2019 topsoil. Short, 194 Wash, at 428-29. The court held that the immunity statute applied to that claim. Id. at 430.\n\u00b632 The governmental entities also rely on Halverson, which they assert holds that tort immunity is inapplicable only when the alleged violation is based solely on constitutional grounds, and they assert that the immunity applies here because the landowners have pleaded tort claims as well as constitutional claims.\n\u00b633 In Halverson, the court discussed a \u201chybrid\u201d tort and inverse condemnation claim. Halverson, 139 Wn.2d at 11-12. But that was in the context of whether the county could be held liable under the tort concept of joint and several liability. Id. at 11. The landowners did not introduce such a hybrid concept here.\n\u00b634 The governmental entities incorrectly assert that because the landowners claim that the entities negligently constructed the dike in the wrong location, their takings action is actually a tort action, to which it is immune as in Short. The landowners\u2019 claim is for blocking a natural drainway or flood channel. Negligence is not an issue.\nInverse Condemnation\n\u00b635 Article I, section 16 of the Washington Constitution prohibits the taking or damaging of private property without just compensation. The Washington Supreme Court has interpreted this provision to allow a landowner to bring an inverse condemnation action to \u201c \u2018recover the value of property which has been appropriated in fact, but with no formal exercise of [condemnation] power.\u2019 \u201d Pierce v. Ne. Lake Wash. Sewer & Water Dist., 123 Wn.2d 550, 556, 870 P.2d 305 (1994) (alteration in original) (quoting Martin v. Port of Seattle, 64 Wn.2d 309, 310 n.1, 391 P.2d 540 (1964)).\n\u00b636 The elements of inverse condemnation are: \u201c(1) a taking or damaging (2) of private property (3) for public use (4) without just compensation being paid (5) by a governmental entity that has not instituted formal proceedings.\u201d Phillips, 136 Wn.2d at 957. \u201cThe taking or damaging of property to the extent that it is reasonably necessary for the maintenance and operation of other property devoted to a public use is a taking or damaging for a public use and subject to the provisions of article I, section 16, of the Washington State Constitution.\u201d Dickgieser v. State, 153 Wn.2d 530, 535, 105 P.3d 26 (2005).\n\u00b637 The parties generally agree that a takings claim can lie for damages that are \u201cnecessarily incident to\u201d or a \u201cnecessary consequence of\u201d a public project. State\u2019s Br. at 16-17; County\u2019s Br. at 25-26; Appellants\u2019 Br. at 8-11. But the government entities assert that their actions do not constitute a taking because the damage to the landowners\u2019 property was not contemplated by them and it was not \u201cnecessarily incident to\u201d the construction of the dike. State\u2019s Br. at 16-17; County\u2019s Br. at 22-28. A similar argument was made and rejected by this court in Lambier v. City of Kennewick, 56 Wn. App. 275, 279-80, 783 P.2d 596 (1989). Lambier held, \u201cThe unintended results of a governmental act may constitute a \u2018taking\u2019.\u201d Lambier, 56 Wn. App. at 281. But the landowners must show proximate cause between the governmental activity and the landowners\u2019 loss. Halverson, 139 Wn.2d at 12-13 (\u201c \u2018To have a taking, some governmental activity must have been the direct or proximate cause of the landowner\u2019s loss.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Phillips, 136 Wn.2d at 966 (citing Lambier, 56 Wn. App. at 283 n.4))).\n\u00b638 Liability may exist when the alleged taking or damage was caused by affirmative action of a government entity, i.e., appropriating the land, restricting its use through regulation, or causing damage by constructing a public project to achieve a public purpose. Rains v. Dep\u2019t of Fisheries, 89 Wn.2d 740, 745-47, 575 P.2d 1057 (1978). Here, the landowners assert that the government entities\u2019 affirmative action was their construction, maintenance, and modification of the dike. The state claims that it did not own, plan, construct, operate, maintain, or design the dike. The landowners presented evidence that (1) the county-received right-of-way deeds for the dike, which was used in part as a public recreation trail, in early 1990; (2) the land upon which the dike was built was deeded to the county and state sometime in the 1990s; (3) the state and county made written agreements for the 1975 construction of the dike as well as for the improvements and modification in 1978, which would be performed by the county subject to the approval of the director of ecology; (4) the county and state were both involved in the construction and improvement of the dike, which was intended to \u201cprotect nearby properties, including Highway 20, from flood damage in high water events\u201d (CP at 92-93); and (5) the state and county, as co-owners, applied to repair the dike.\n\u00b639 The landowners properly state that they have presented genuine issues of material fact regarding the state\u2019s and the county\u2019s roles in the construction, improvement, and maintenance of the dike in which they had ownership interest, rendering summary judgment inappropriate on this basis.\n\u00b640 The county asserts that a proximate cause of the flooding was the presence and release of an upstream logjam. This is a question for the jury. It also claims that the logjam was an \u201cintervening natural event\u201d that negates the claim that the avulsion of the stream and damage to the property was necessarily incident to the dike. County\u2019s Br. at 28. Because the county does not support its intervening natural event theory with authority, we will not address it. See RAP 10.3(a)(5); Cowiche Canyon Conservancy v. Bosley, 118 Wn.2d 801, 809, 828 P.2d 549 (1992).\n\u00b641 The landowners have presented issues of fact that preclude summary judgment on their inverse condemnation claim.\n\u00b642 Reversed and remanded.\nSweeney, C.J., concurs.\nThe state and county are referred to, collectively, in this opinion as the government entities. Other named parties were dismissed on summary judgment. The landowners\u2019 do not appeal their dismissal.\nThe levees in Halverson \u201care located between 50 and 1,000 feet from the Skagit River\u2019s banks. The river waters do not come into contact with the levees until the waters leave the banks of the river channel.\u201d Halverson, 139 Wn.2d at 5. In this case, no assertion is made regarding the placement of the dikes in relation to the riverbanks.\nSee, e.g., Wilber v. W. Props., 14 Wn. App. 169, 173-74, 540 P.2d 470 (1975) (obstruction of drainage ditch caused backed-up water and flooding); Dahlgren v. Chi., Milwaukee & Puget Sound Ry., 85 Wash. 395, 406, 148 P. 567 (1915) (obstruction of watercourse caused backup flow flooding); Miller v. E. Ry. & Lumber Co., 84 Wash. 31, 33, 35-36, 146 P. 171 (1915) (obstruction of stream caused backup flow, flooding plaintiff\u2019s land).",

Moreover, the State lacks the necessary proprietary interest in the Sloan-Witchert Slough Dike to attach liability under Halverson.

    "Songstad v. Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle",
    "Pearson, J.\nPlaintiffs Songstad, and others having an interest in certain property, appeal from a judgment entered on a jury verdict in favor of the defendant, Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle (called Metro).\nThe action sought to recover damages for alleged injury to plaintiffs\u2019 real property, caused during and after the installation by defendant of the Eastside Interceptor Line, a large sewage disposal line on the east side of Lake Washington. Four theories of liability were asserted in support of plaintiffs\u2019 claim, namely, negligence, trespass, inverse condemnation, and breach of covenant. Defendants claimed contributory negligence as an affirmative defense.\nThe property allegedly damaged was at the foot of a slope which faced generally toward the west. Along the top of the slope was a railroad track. Metro acquired an easement for the sewer along the right-of-way of the railroad, but in order to place the line the required 40 feet from the track, the municipality had to build up the slope by adding a fill. To that end, Metro acquired a \u201cslope easement\u201d from plaintiffs, allowing it to pile dirt on plaintiffs\u2019 property in constructing the fill to support the pipe. The fill extended down the existing slope and rested on the lower ground at the bottom of the slope.\nBefore the fill was constructed, the slope was stable and covered with vegetation. There was a drainage ditch at the base (toe) of the slope which carried water along the toe in a southerly direction, where it met a creek which carried off the water flowing off and out of the slope. In constructing the fill, Metro removed vegetation from the existing slope and piled large amounts of fresh earth on the slope and on the lower ground at the bottom of the slope. Engineering efforts were made to allow water to drain along the preexisting path at the toe of the slope.\nThe plaintiffs contended that the construction of the fill and installation of the pipe altered the existing course of water, causing their property to be flooded and the soil to become wet and marshy. The plaintiffs\u2019 version of what happened was that the defendant permitted rock and earth to wash or precipitate onto their property. This loose earth and rock clogged the drain or ditches, resulting in the flooding. This wet condition, plaintiffs allege, delayed the completion of construction of a drive-in theater on the property by approximately 1 year,, costing them profits and additional construction expenses. -\nAt the trial, the testimony was conflicting as to whether or not the plaintiffs\u2019 property was flooded and marshy prior to the construction of the fill. The evidence was also sharply contradictory concerning whether or not the fill caused the flooding and wetness to plaintiffs\u2019 property, delaying. the completion of the drive-in theater. There was also conflicting testimony as to whether or not the plaintiffs contributed to their damages by making a deep cut in the toe of the slope, causing a hillside spring to open.\nThe trial court allowed the jury to consider only one of plaintiffs\u2019 theories of liability, namely, negligence. The refusal of the court to instruct the jury on trespass and inverse condemnation are two of the principal assignments of error on appeal. The breach of covenant theory was apparently abandoned.\nWe shall consider the inverse condemnation theory first. In this regard, plaintiffs contended that the deposits of rock and earth on their property, which interfered with the drainage of water, rendered the property unfit for use. In rejecting this theory, the trial court determined as a matter of law that there was no unconstitutional taking of plaintiffs\u2019 property under the evidence produced.\nThe leading Washington cases concerning whether various types of damage constitute a taking of property or simply a tortious interference therewith are: Wong Kee Jun v. Seattle, 143 Wash. 479, 255 P. 645, 52 A.L.R. 625 (1927); Boitano v. Snohomish County, 11 Wn.2d 664, 120 P.2d 490 (1941); and Olson v. King County, 71 Wn.2d 279, 428 P.2d 562 (1967).\nUnder those decisions, an inverse condemnation has not occurred unless the damage is contemplated by the plan of work or considered to be a necessary incident of the maintenance of the property for a public purpose. Moreover, the interference with the property , must be of a permanent nature.\nIn Olson v. King County, supra at 284 and 285, the Supreme. Court said:\nWe see no constitutional taking or damaging in this case. Every trespass upon, or tortious damaging of real property does not become a constitutional taking or damaging simply because the trespasser or tort-feasor is the state or one of its subdivisions, such as a county or' a city.\nThere have been two factors which have furnished some excuse for warping and torturing the results of tortious conduct into a constitutional taking or damaging of property. One, the immunity from tort liability long enjoyed by the state and its subdivisions; and, two, the failure on the part of the owners t>f obviously damaged property to file the claims which were conditions precedent to a tort action where such actions were permitted.\nThe immunity is now gone in this state; and in this \u25a0 particular case the claims were timely filed.\nConcededly the distinction between a constitutional taking and damaging and tortious conduct by the state or one of its subdivisions is not always clear. But subsequent to the comprehensive analysis of our cases by Judge Tolman in Wong Kee Jun v. Seattle, 143 Wash. 479, 255 Pac. 645, 52 A.L.R. 625 (1927), supplemented by Judge Steinert\u2019s scholarly discussion in Boitano v. Snoho-mish Cy., 11 Wn.2d 664, 120 P.2d 490 (1941), we have adhered fairly closely to the principles enunciated in those cases.\nIn the instant case, it appears that Northrup Road was constructed some time prior to 1935. The fill above the plaintiffs\u2019 properties occasioned no damage to their properties until 1962. The inundating of the properties of the plaintiffs with rocks, dirt, silt and debris in 1962 was neither contemplated by the plan of the work, nor was it a necessary incident in the building or maintenance of the road. The damage occurred because, as the trial court found, the county negligently failed to follow the recognized standard of care to protect the fill from being eroded by the water coming through the culvert.\nThe present case falls into the category referred to in Wong Kee Jun, supra, as a \u201cmere temporary interference with a private property right . . . such as might have been avoided by due care.\u201d The case of Peterson v. King Cy., 41 Wn.2d 907, 252 P.2d 797 (1953), where due care would have prevented a slide onto the plaintiff\u2019s property, is in point. In a somewhat similar case in Idaho where the city\u2019s failure to keep a flume in repair had permitted water, sand, silt and debris to cover the plaintiff\u2019s property, there was not even a suggestion of a constitutional taking or damaging, although Idaho has a comparable constitutional provision. Dunn v. Boise City, 45 Ida. 362, 262 Pac. 507 (1927); 48 Ida. 550, 283 Pac. 606 (1929).\nIn this case, Metro had obtained the right to construct the fill by obtaining an easement to the slope and adjacent lower ground. Moreover, it worked according to a plan concerning the slope and location of the fill, as well as for the laying of the pipe (exhibit 54).\nIn the case of Boitano v. Snohomish County, supra, the court quoted from Jorguson v. Seattle, 80 Wash. 126, 141 P. 334 (1914) at 130 and 131:\n[T]he constitution was never intended to apply to consequential or resultant damages not anticipated in, nor a part of, the plan of a public work. It was never intended to apply to damages resulting to private property from the negligent or wrongful use of public property. As to such damages, tortious in their very inception, the injured person is remitted to his remedy on the case, as in other cases of tortious taking or injury.\nWe believe this case involves at most a tortious injury to property. The alleged damages were not contemplated in the plan of construction, nor were they necessarily incident to the construction work performed by Metro. Most of plaintiffs\u2019 testimony was addressed to showing that Metro was negligent in the manner in which it constructed and maintained the fill. Several possibilities were advanced as to how the damage could have been avoided or lessened. Among those possibilities were the construction of a wall at the toe of the slope; extensive sodding, seeding or planting of the slope itself; and the construction of a deep drainage ditch or berm at the top of the slope, to allow water to run along the top, rather than drain down the face of the slope. Some of these steps were eventually taken, but according to plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, they were either too late or too little to avoid the injury.\nLikewise, there was no proof that damages were permanent in nature. The testimony at most showed a temporary interference with the ability of plaintiffs to complete their construction project. No qualified experts were called to testify as to permanent damage. We find no error in the refusal of the trial court to instruct the jury on an inverse condemnation theory.\nWe next address ourselves to the refusal of the trial court to instruct the jury on plaintiffs\u2019 theory of trespass. The plaintiffs requested and the court refused to give instruction No. 2, which states:\nOwnership of property necessarily implies the right to exclusive use and enjoyment, and any unauthorized use of the adjoining premises which results in a trespass renders the trespasser liable for resulting damage to the adjoining property owner. If one of two adjoining owners wishes to raise the grade of his lot, he must build a wall on his own ground, or in some other way, keep the dirt within his own line. He cannot so fill up his own lot so as to let earth pass over his fine onto the lot of his neighbor.\nThe plaintiffs presented witnesses who testified that the defendants placed earth outside the area of the slope easement, which would ordinarily justify a trespass instruction. However, those witnesses called to testify on this issue had observed that action prior to the execution of the slope easement agreement in January of 1966. Many photographs were admitted from which witnesses identified fresh earth, purportedly outside the slope easement area. Such photographs, however, were taken in late 1965 and prior to the execution of the slope easement agreement. The legal description for the slope easement agreement was approved by plaintiffs\u2019 engineers and we think Metro had a right to assume that it sufficiently covered the area needed for the work which had already been completed by January, 1966. See MacKenzie-Richardson, Inc. v. Allert, 45 Wn.2d 1, 272 P.2d 146 (1954).\nThere was testimony from which the jury might conclude that subsequent to the execution of the slope easement agreement dirt and rock were precipitated upon plaintiffs\u2019 property by the process of erosion or gravity. This was the basis for the negligence instruction given by the court. We note also that instruction No. 4 submitted plaintiffs\u2019 theory of damage from \u201cerosion and sloughing,\u201d albeit in terms of the failure of defendant in taking proper precautions against that eventuality.\nThe Supreme Court in Zimmer v. Stephenson, 66 Wn.2d 477, 403 P.2d 343 (1965) was required to differentiate between actions characterized as \u201ctrespass\u201d and those characterized as \u201ctrespass on the case\u201d in order to determine whether the 3-year or 2-year statute of limitations applied. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that his wheat caught fire and that the fire was caused by a spark or piece of burning carbon cast onto his property from the exhaust stack of defendant\u2019s caterpillar, which was not properly equipped with a spark arrester. Under RCW 4.16.080(1) an action for \u201ctrespass upon real property\u201d must be brought within 3 years, while RCW 4.16.130 provided a 2-year statute of limitations for actions not otherwise provided for.\nIn holding that the 3-year statute of limitations applied, the court concluded that plaintiff alleged an action for \u201cnegligent trespass.\u201d\nThe court stated at page 481:\nThe actions of trespass and trespass on the case have been, during the era of their use, regarded as concurrent remedies, where they approach the dividing line so closely as to scarcely be distinguishable.\nThe court further states at page 482:\nThe action of the defendant, as alleged by plaintiff, would, if found to be negligent, constitute the immediate and direct cause of the injury claimed. The merits of the action would be the same under either form of action. No sound reason exists to search for a technical distinction.\n. . . The direct-indirect distinction between trespass and case is \u201cnow rejected by most courts, and would appear to be slowly on its way to oblivion.\u201d Prosser, Torts \u00a7 13, p. 66 (3d ed.). Restatement, Torts \u00a7\u00a7 158, 165 has ab\u00e1ndoned the distinction, and now regards any tor-tious intrusion of' foreign matter onto the property of \u25a0another as a trespass. \u25a0 ....\nWhile the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 158 and 165 (1965) does abandon the distinction between trespass and case, designating all intrusions of foreign matter, as \u201ctrespass,\u201d at the same time it classifies the types of intrusions by whether they are intentional intrusions (Section 158) or intrusions which are caused recklessly or negligently or as a result of abnormally dangerous activity. (Section 165.) The latter section states at page 300:\nOne who recklessly or negligently, or as a result of an abnormally dangerous activity, enters land in the possession of another or causes a thing or third person so to enter is subject to liability to the possessor if, but only if, his presence or the presence of the thing or the third person upon the land causes harm to the land, to the possessor, or to a thing or a third person in whose security the possessor has a legally protected interest.\nSection 158 states at page 277:\nOne is subject to liability to another for trespass, irrespective of whether he thereby causes harm to any legally protected interest of the other, if he intentionally\n(a) enters land in the possession of the other, or causes a thing or a third person to do so, or\n(b) remains on the land, or\n(c) fails to remove from the land a thing which he is under a duty to remove.\nSection 158, comment (i) at 278 and 279 provides:\nIn order that there may be a trespass under the rule stated in this Section, it is not necessary that the foreign matter should be thrown directly and immediately upon the other\u2019s land. It is enough that an act is done with knowledge that it will to a substantial certainty result in the entry of the foreign matter. Thus one who so piles sand close to his boundary that by force of gravity alone it slides down onto his neighbor\u2019s land,. or who so builds an embankment that during ordinary rainfalls the dirt from it is washed upon adjacent lands, becomes a trespasser on the other\u2019s land.\n(Italics ours.)\nThe following analysis of this question appears in 1 F. Harper and F. James, The Law of Torts, \u00a7 1.4 (1956) at 11 and 12:\nThe conduct which today forms the basis of liability for the invasion of the interest in the exclusive possession of land may be of three general types: (1) conduct intended to cause an intrusion upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises; (2) conduct which, although not intended to cause an intrusion on the premises of another, is negligent with respect to the landowner\u2019s interest in the exclusive possession of his land; and (3) conduct which, although neither intended to cause an intrusion of another\u2019s premises nor negligent with respect to his interest therein in the sense that it creates unreasonable risks of such an intrusion, nevertheless creates such grave risks that it falls within that class of conduct which the law regards as \u201cextra-hazardous\u201d and therefore predicates thereon a liability which is described as \u201cstrict\u201d or \u201cabsolute\u201d liability.\nWhile under the old procedure the action of trespass quare clausum fregit was the appropriate remedy for all these invasions of the interest in the exclusive possession of land, the second type of invasion is now governed by the general principles of negligence and the third is thought of as included in the principles governing extra-hazardous conduct, leaving only the first type of invasion as constituting the modern tort of \u201ctrespass\u201d upon land.\nAt first blush, this statement may seem inconsistent with comment (i) of the Restatement quoted above. However, the requirement that the act is done \u201cwith knowledge that it will to a substantial certainty result in the entry of the foreign matter\u201d seems consistent with \u201cconduct intended to cause an intrusion upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises\u201d so as to equate the two analyses.\nWe believe that no prejudicial error resulted by the refusal of the trial court to give plaintiffs\u2019 proposed trespass instruction for the following reasons:\n(1) Under the rationale of Zimmer, we believe that the merits of the action would be reached under either trespass or negligence.\n(2) Under the rationale of Zimmer, the action here would be better categorized as a negligent rather than in tentional intrusion onto plaintiffs\u2019 property, so that the negligence instructions in fact reached the merits of the case.\n(3) Assuming arguendo that the evidence was sufficient to support the type of \u201cintentional intrusion\u201d referred to in Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 158 comment (i) (1965) quoted above, we do not believe that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed instruction correctly stated the law, in that it omitted the requirement that the act be done \u201cwith knowledge that it will to a substantial certainty result in the entry of the foreign matter.\u201d Accordingly, the court was justified in refusing the instruction. See Rickert v. Geppert, 72 Wn.2d 1040, 432 P.2d 645 (1967).\nSeveral of plaintiffs\u2019 assignments of error relate to the refusal of the trial court to instruct the jury on the issue of permanent damage to their land. The trial court had rejected the only offered testimony relating to permanent damage and we must determine whether or not that exclusion was proper.\nPlaintiffs sought through Mr. Hoefer, a real estate appraiser, to establish a permanent impairment of the market value because of an alleged \u201ccontinual threat of subsequent invasions.\u201d\nWhere there is permanent damage to real property which cannot be restored, the measure of damages includes the loss in market value to the extent that depreciation thereof exceeds the cost of restoration. Olson v. King County, 71 Wn.2d 279, 428 P.2d 562 (1967).\nThe trial court excluded the offered testimony for two reasons: (1) because permanent damages had not been pleaded, and (2) because of Mr. Hoefer\u2019s lack of qualifications. The trial court believed that whether or not there was a risk of future \u201cinvasions\u201d was an engineering question on which the witness lacked expertise.\nThe matter of qualifications of an expert witness falls within the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Tatum, 58 Wn.2d 73, 360 P.2d 754 (1961). We see no abuse of discretion on either of the grounds mentioned.\nThe court did allow: (1) testimony as to the net cash flow profit of the theater during the year it could not open; (2) testimony of the rental value of the land during the year when construction was delayed; and (3) testimony as to the cost of repairing and restoring the property as well as the additional cost of construction resulting from the claimed interference. The court likewise instructed the jury on the proper measure of damage (absent proof of permanent damages), namely, the cost of restoration, together with the loss of use. Colella v. King County, 72 Wn.2d 386, 433 P.2d 154 (1967).\nWe find no error in the court\u2019s instructions concerning damages.\nIn the court\u2019s instruction No. 10, the jury was told:\nYou are instructed as a matter of law that the ",

            "text": "Pearson, J.\nPlaintiffs Songstad, and others having an interest in certain property, appeal from a judgment entered on a jury verdict in favor of the defendant, Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle (called Metro).\nThe action sought to recover damages for alleged injury to plaintiffs\u2019 real property, caused during and after the installation by defendant of the Eastside Interceptor Line, a large sewage disposal line on the east side of Lake Washington. Four theories of liability were asserted in support of plaintiffs\u2019 claim, namely, negligence, trespass, inverse condemnation, and breach of covenant. Defendants claimed contributory negligence as an affirmative defense.\nThe property allegedly damaged was at the foot of a slope which faced generally toward the west. Along the top of the slope was a railroad track. Metro acquired an easement for the sewer along the right-of-way of the railroad, but in order to place the line the required 40 feet from the track, the municipality had to build up the slope by adding a fill. To that end, Metro acquired a \u201cslope easement\u201d from plaintiffs, allowing it to pile dirt on plaintiffs\u2019 property in constructing the fill to support the pipe. The fill extended down the existing slope and rested on the lower ground at the bottom of the slope.\nBefore the fill was constructed, the slope was stable and covered with vegetation. There was a drainage ditch at the base (toe) of the slope which carried water along the toe in a southerly direction, where it met a creek which carried off the water flowing off and out of the slope. In constructing the fill, Metro removed vegetation from the existing slope and piled large amounts of fresh earth on the slope and on the lower ground at the bottom of the slope. Engineering efforts were made to allow water to drain along the preexisting path at the toe of the slope.\nThe plaintiffs contended that the construction of the fill and installation of the pipe altered the existing course of water, causing their property to be flooded and the soil to become wet and marshy. The plaintiffs\u2019 version of what happened was that the defendant permitted rock and earth to wash or precipitate onto their property. This loose earth and rock clogged the drain or ditches, resulting in the flooding. This wet condition, plaintiffs allege, delayed the completion of construction of a drive-in theater on the property by approximately 1 year,, costing them profits and additional construction expenses. -\nAt the trial, the testimony was conflicting as to whether or not the plaintiffs\u2019 property was flooded and marshy prior to the construction of the fill. The evidence was also sharply contradictory concerning whether or not the fill caused the flooding and wetness to plaintiffs\u2019 property, delaying. the completion of the drive-in theater. There was also conflicting testimony as to whether or not the plaintiffs contributed to their damages by making a deep cut in the toe of the slope, causing a hillside spring to open.\nThe trial court allowed the jury to consider only one of plaintiffs\u2019 theories of liability, namely, negligence. The refusal of the court to instruct the jury on trespass and inverse condemnation are two of the principal assignments of error on appeal. The breach of covenant theory was apparently abandoned.\nWe shall consider the inverse condemnation theory first. In this regard, plaintiffs contended that the deposits of rock and earth on their property, which interfered with the drainage of water, rendered the property unfit for use. In rejecting this theory, the trial court determined as a matter of law that there was no unconstitutional taking of plaintiffs\u2019 property under the evidence produced.\nThe leading Washington cases concerning whether various types of damage constitute a taking of property or simply a tortious interference therewith are: Wong Kee Jun v. Seattle, 143 Wash. 479, 255 P. 645, 52 A.L.R. 625 (1927); Boitano v. Snohomish County, 11 Wn.2d 664, 120 P.2d 490 (1941); and Olson v. King County, 71 Wn.2d 279, 428 P.2d 562 (1967).\nUnder those decisions, an inverse condemnation has not occurred unless the damage is contemplated by the plan of work or considered to be a necessary incident of the maintenance of the property for a public purpose. Moreover, the interference with the property , must be of a permanent nature.\nIn Olson v. King County, supra at 284 and 285, the Supreme. Court said:\nWe see no constitutional taking or damaging in this case. Every trespass upon, or tortious damaging of real property does not become a constitutional taking or damaging simply because the trespasser or tort-feasor is the state or one of its subdivisions, such as a county or' a city.\nThere have been two factors which have furnished some excuse for warping and torturing the results of tortious conduct into a constitutional taking or damaging of property. One, the immunity from tort liability long enjoyed by the state and its subdivisions; and, two, the failure on the part of the owners t>f obviously damaged property to file the claims which were conditions precedent to a tort action where such actions were permitted.\nThe immunity is now gone in this state; and in this \u25a0 particular case the claims were timely filed.\nConcededly the distinction between a constitutional taking and damaging and tortious conduct by the state or one of its subdivisions is not always clear. But subsequent to the comprehensive analysis of our cases by Judge Tolman in Wong Kee Jun v. Seattle, 143 Wash. 479, 255 Pac. 645, 52 A.L.R. 625 (1927), supplemented by Judge Steinert\u2019s scholarly discussion in Boitano v. Snoho-mish Cy., 11 Wn.2d 664, 120 P.2d 490 (1941), we have adhered fairly closely to the principles enunciated in those cases.\nIn the instant case, it appears that Northrup Road was constructed some time prior to 1935. The fill above the plaintiffs\u2019 properties occasioned no damage to their properties until 1962. The inundating of the properties of the plaintiffs with rocks, dirt, silt and debris in 1962 was neither contemplated by the plan of the work, nor was it a necessary incident in the building or maintenance of the road. The damage occurred because, as the trial court found, the county negligently failed to follow the recognized standard of care to protect the fill from being eroded by the water coming through the culvert.\nThe present case falls into the category referred to in Wong Kee Jun, supra, as a \u201cmere temporary interference with a private property right . . . such as might have been avoided by due care.\u201d The case of Peterson v. King Cy., 41 Wn.2d 907, 252 P.2d 797 (1953), where due care would have prevented a slide onto the plaintiff\u2019s property, is in point. In a somewhat similar case in Idaho where the city\u2019s failure to keep a flume in repair had permitted water, sand, silt and debris to cover the plaintiff\u2019s property, there was not even a suggestion of a constitutional taking or damaging, although Idaho has a comparable constitutional provision. Dunn v. Boise City, 45 Ida. 362, 262 Pac. 507 (1927); 48 Ida. 550, 283 Pac. 606 (1929).\nIn this case, Metro had obtained the right to construct the fill by obtaining an easement to the slope and adjacent lower ground. Moreover, it worked according to a plan concerning the slope and location of the fill, as well as for the laying of the pipe (exhibit 54).\nIn the case of Boitano v. Snohomish County, supra, the court quoted from Jorguson v. Seattle, 80 Wash. 126, 141 P. 334 (1914) at 130 and 131:\n[T]he constitution was never intended to apply to consequential or resultant damages not anticipated in, nor a part of, the plan of a public work. It was never intended to apply to damages resulting to private property from the negligent or wrongful use of public property. As to such damages, tortious in their very inception, the injured person is remitted to his remedy on the case, as in other cases of tortious taking or injury.\nWe believe this case involves at most a tortious injury to property. The alleged damages were not contemplated in the plan of construction, nor were they necessarily incident to the construction work performed by Metro. Most of plaintiffs\u2019 testimony was addressed to showing that Metro was negligent in the manner in which it constructed and maintained the fill. Several possibilities were advanced as to how the damage could have been avoided or lessened. Among those possibilities were the construction of a wall at the toe of the slope; extensive sodding, seeding or planting of the slope itself; and the construction of a deep drainage ditch or berm at the top of the slope, to allow water to run along the top, rather than drain down the face of the slope. Some of these steps were eventually taken, but according to plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, they were either too late or too little to avoid the injury.\nLikewise, there was no proof that damages were permanent in nature. The testimony at most showed a temporary interference with the ability of plaintiffs to complete their construction project. No qualified experts were called to testify as to permanent damage. We find no error in the refusal of the trial court to instruct the jury on an inverse condemnation theory.\nWe next address ourselves to the refusal of the trial court to instruct the jury on plaintiffs\u2019 theory of trespass. The plaintiffs requested and the court refused to give instruction No. 2, which states:\nOwnership of property necessarily implies the right to exclusive use and enjoyment, and any unauthorized use of the adjoining premises which results in a trespass renders the trespasser liable for resulting damage to the adjoining property owner. If one of two adjoining owners wishes to raise the grade of his lot, he must build a wall on his own ground, or in some other way, keep the dirt within his own line. He cannot so fill up his own lot so as to let earth pass over his fine onto the lot of his neighbor.\nThe plaintiffs presented witnesses who testified that the defendants placed earth outside the area of the slope easement, which would ordinarily justify a trespass instruction. However, those witnesses called to testify on this issue had observed that action prior to the execution of the slope easement agreement in January of 1966. Many photographs were admitted from which witnesses identified fresh earth, purportedly outside the slope easement area. Such photographs, however, were taken in late 1965 and prior to the execution of the slope easement agreement. The legal description for the slope easement agreement was approved by plaintiffs\u2019 engineers and we think Metro had a right to assume that it sufficiently covered the area needed for the work which had already been completed by January, 1966. See MacKenzie-Richardson, Inc. v. Allert, 45 Wn.2d 1, 272 P.2d 146 (1954).\nThere was testimony from which the jury might conclude that subsequent to the execution of the slope easement agreement dirt and rock were precipitated upon plaintiffs\u2019 property by the process of erosion or gravity. This was the basis for the negligence instruction given by the court. We note also that instruction No. 4 submitted plaintiffs\u2019 theory of damage from \u201cerosion and sloughing,\u201d albeit in terms of the failure of defendant in taking proper precautions against that eventuality.\nThe Supreme Court in Zimmer v. Stephenson, 66 Wn.2d 477, 403 P.2d 343 (1965) was required to differentiate between actions characterized as \u201ctrespass\u201d and those characterized as \u201ctrespass on the case\u201d in order to determine whether the 3-year or 2-year statute of limitations applied. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that his wheat caught fire and that the fire was caused by a spark or piece of burning carbon cast onto his property from the exhaust stack of defendant\u2019s caterpillar, which was not properly equipped with a spark arrester. Under RCW 4.16.080(1) an action for \u201ctrespass upon real property\u201d must be brought within 3 years, while RCW 4.16.130 provided a 2-year statute of limitations for actions not otherwise provided for.\nIn holding that the 3-year statute of limitations applied, the court concluded that plaintiff alleged an action for \u201cnegligent trespass.\u201d\nThe court stated at page 481:\nThe actions of trespass and trespass on the case have been, during the era of their use, regarded as concurrent remedies, where they approach the dividing line so closely as to scarcely be distinguishable.\nThe court further states at page 482:\nThe action of the defendant, as alleged by plaintiff, would, if found to be negligent, constitute the immediate and direct cause of the injury claimed. The merits of the action would be the same under either form of action. No sound reason exists to search for a technical distinction.\n. . . The direct-indirect distinction between trespass and case is \u201cnow rejected by most courts, and would appear to be slowly on its way to oblivion.\u201d Prosser, Torts \u00a7 13, p. 66 (3d ed.). Restatement, Torts \u00a7\u00a7 158, 165 has ab\u00e1ndoned the distinction, and now regards any tor-tious intrusion of' foreign matter onto the property of \u25a0another as a trespass. \u25a0 ....\nWhile the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 158 and 165 (1965) does abandon the distinction between trespass and case, designating all intrusions of foreign matter, as \u201ctrespass,\u201d at the same time it classifies the types of intrusions by whether they are intentional intrusions (Section 158) or intrusions which are caused recklessly or negligently or as a result of abnormally dangerous activity. (Section 165.) The latter section states at page 300:\nOne who recklessly or negligently, or as a result of an abnormally dangerous activity, enters land in the possession of another or causes a thing or third person so to enter is subject to liability to the possessor if, but only if, his presence or the presence of the thing or the third person upon the land causes harm to the land, to the possessor, or to a thing or a third person in whose security the possessor has a legally protected interest.\nSection 158 states at page 277:\nOne is subject to liability to another for trespass, irrespective of whether he thereby causes harm to any legally protected interest of the other, if he intentionally\n(a) enters land in the possession of the other, or causes a thing or a third person to do so, or\n(b) remains on the land, or\n(c) fails to remove from the land a thing which he is under a duty to remove.\nSection 158, comment (i) at 278 and 279 provides:\nIn order that there may be a trespass under the rule stated in this Section, it is not necessary that the foreign matter should be thrown directly and immediately upon the other\u2019s land. It is enough that an act is done with knowledge that it will to a substantial certainty result in the entry of the foreign matter. Thus one who so piles sand close to his boundary that by force of gravity alone it slides down onto his neighbor\u2019s land,. or who so builds an embankment that during ordinary rainfalls the dirt from it is washed upon adjacent lands, becomes a trespasser on the other\u2019s land.\n(Italics ours.)\nThe following analysis of this question appears in 1 F. Harper and F. James, The Law of Torts, \u00a7 1.4 (1956) at 11 and 12:\nThe conduct which today forms the basis of liability for the invasion of the interest in the exclusive possession of land may be of three general types: (1) conduct intended to cause an intrusion upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises; (2) conduct which, although not intended to cause an intrusion on the premises of another, is negligent with respect to the landowner\u2019s interest in the exclusive possession of his land; and (3) conduct which, although neither intended to cause an intrusion of another\u2019s premises nor negligent with respect to his interest therein in the sense that it creates unreasonable risks of such an intrusion, nevertheless creates such grave risks that it falls within that class of conduct which the law regards as \u201cextra-hazardous\u201d and therefore predicates thereon a liability which is described as \u201cstrict\u201d or \u201cabsolute\u201d liability.\nWhile under the old procedure the action of trespass quare clausum fregit was the appropriate remedy for all these invasions of the interest in the exclusive possession of land, the second type of invasion is now governed by the general principles of negligence and the third is thought of as included in the principles governing extra-hazardous conduct, leaving only the first type of invasion as constituting the modern tort of \u201ctrespass\u201d upon land.\nAt first blush, this statement may seem inconsistent with comment (i) of the Restatement quoted above. However, the requirement that the act is done \u201cwith knowledge that it will to a substantial certainty result in the entry of the foreign matter\u201d seems consistent with \u201cconduct intended to cause an intrusion upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises\u201d so as to equate the two analyses.\nWe believe that no prejudicial error resulted by the refusal of the trial court to give plaintiffs\u2019 proposed trespass instruction for the following reasons:\n(1) Under the rationale of Zimmer, we believe that the merits of the action would be reached under either trespass or negligence.\n(2) Under the rationale of Zimmer, the action here would be better categorized as a negligent rather than in tentional intrusion onto plaintiffs\u2019 property, so that the negligence instructions in fact reached the merits of the case.\n(3) Assuming arguendo that the evidence was sufficient to support the type of \u201cintentional intrusion\u201d referred to in Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 158 comment (i) (1965) quoted above, we do not believe that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed instruction correctly stated the law, in that it omitted the requirement that the act be done \u201cwith knowledge that it will to a substantial certainty result in the entry of the foreign matter.\u201d Accordingly, the court was justified in refusing the instruction. See Rickert v. Geppert, 72 Wn.2d 1040, 432 P.2d 645 (1967).\nSeveral of plaintiffs\u2019 assignments of error relate to the refusal of the trial court to instruct the jury on the issue of permanent damage to their land. The trial court had rejected the only offered testimony relating to permanent damage and we must determine whether or not that exclusion was proper.\nPlaintiffs sought through Mr. Hoefer, a real estate appraiser, to establish a permanent impairment of the market value because of an alleged \u201ccontinual threat of subsequent invasions.\u201d\nWhere there is permanent damage to real property which cannot be restored, the measure of damages includes the loss in market value to the extent that depreciation thereof exceeds the cost of restoration. Olson v. King County, 71 Wn.2d 279, 428 P.2d 562 (1967).\nThe trial court excluded the offered testimony for two reasons: (1) because permanent damages had not been pleaded, and (2) because of Mr. Hoefer\u2019s lack of qualifications. The trial court believed that whether or not there was a risk of future \u201cinvasions\u201d was an engineering question on which the witness lacked expertise.\nThe matter of qualifications of an expert witness falls within the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Tatum, 58 Wn.2d 73, 360 P.2d 754 (1961). We see no abuse of discretion on either of the grounds mentioned.\nThe court did allow: (1) testimony as to the net cash flow profit of the theater during the year it could not open; (2) testimony of the rental value of the land during the year when construction was delayed; and (3) testimony as to the cost of repairing and restoring the property as well as the additional cost of construction resulting from the claimed interference. The court likewise instructed the jury on the proper measure of damage (absent proof of permanent damages), namely, the cost of restoration, together with the loss of use. Colella v. King County, 72 Wn.2d 386, 433 P.2d 154 (1967).\nWe find no error in the court\u2019s instructions concerning damages.\nIn the court\u2019s instruction No. 10, the jury was told:\nYou are instructed as a matter of law that the defendant in this case had a legal right in constructing the sewer line involved to remove any and all natural vegetation along the railroad right-of-way, and from the areas acquired from the plaintiffs by the slope easement agreement.\nThe plaintiffs have assigned error to the giving of the instruction on the basis that it takes from the jury a question of fact, ie. whether it was negligence to remove vegetation from the right-of-way and easement. In their assignment, plaintiffs seem to be contending that there was substantial evidence that the Metro was negligent in removing vegetation, thereby causing injury to plaintiffs\u2019 property. However, our examination of the record discloses no substantial evidence of negligence by Metro in clearing vegetation from the right-of-way and easement areas, and appellant has not cited us to portions of the record disclosing such evidence. There is substantial testimony to the effect that clearing vegetation was a necessary and expected element of constructing the fill and laying the pipe. In the absence of sufficient evidence of negligence in removal of vegetation, it was not prejudicial error to give instruction No. 10. Lofgren v. Western Washington Corp. of Seventh Day Adventists, 65 Wn.2d 144, 396 P.2d 139 (1964).\nJudgment is affirmed.\nArmstrong, C. J., and Petrie, J., concur.\nExhibit 70.
