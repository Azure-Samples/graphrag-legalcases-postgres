    The prominent legal precedents in Washington regarding water leaking into an apartment from the floor above are based on two main legal principles: the duty of care in maintaining premises and the implied warranty of habitability.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1. Duty of Care in Maintaining Premises:</b>
    This principle holds landlords responsible for maintaining the premises in a safe and habitable condition, especially when defects are known or should have been known to them. The landlord must ensure that the property does not pose a danger to the tenants.
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prominent Cases:</b>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co. (1914): The court held the landlord liable for damages caused by water leaking from a pipe in the upper story, which the landlord failed to maintain properly. The landlord's negligence in maintaining the water pipe led to the flooding of the tenant's store, causing significant damage.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Thomas v. Housing Authority of the City of Bremerton (1967): The court found the landlord liable for injuries caused by excessively hot water from a water heater, which was a known defect. The landlord's failure to maintain the water heater in a safe condition constituted negligence.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Jorgensen v. Massart (1963): The court held that the landlord was responsible for damages caused by water leaking into the tenant's apartment due to the landlord's failure to maintain the building's roof properly.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>2. Implied Warranty of Habitability</b>
    This principle implies that landlords must provide and maintain rental properties in a condition fit for human habitation. This includes ensuring that essential services such as plumbing are functional and do not pose health hazards.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prominent Cases:</b>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Foisy v. Wyman (1973): The court recognized the implied warranty of habitability, holding that landlords must maintain rental properties in a habitable condition. The tenant was allowed to present evidence of the landlord's failure to repair significant defects, including water leaks, as a defense in an unlawful detainer action.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Stuart v. Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, Inc. (1987): The court extended the implied warranty of habitability to condominium units, requiring that common areas and limited common areas be maintained in a condition fit for their intended use. The landlord was held liable for failing to address water leaks and other defects.

   <b>Summary</b>
    In Washington, landlords are required to maintain rental properties in a safe and habitable condition. Failure to address known defects, such as water leaks from the floor above, can result in liability for damages under the principles of duty of care and implied warranty of habitability. Prominent cases such as Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co., Thomas v. Housing Authority of the City of Bremerton, Jorgensen v. Massart, Foisy v. Wyman, and Stuart v. Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, Inc. illustrate these principles and the legal obligations of landlords.
