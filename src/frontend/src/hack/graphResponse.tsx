    In Washington, several cases set legal precedents on the issue of water leakage into apartments from the floor above, impacting landlord and tenant disputes:
    <br/><br/>    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1. King County v. Boeing Co., 62 Wn.2d 545, 384 P.2d 122 (1963):</b> - This case addresses surface water drainage and the common enemy doctrine.
    Although it primarily involves surface water, the principles about managing water intrusion and landlord responsibilities can be extrapolated to cover indoor water leakage.
    <br/><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>2. Currens v. Sleek, 138 Wn.2d 858, 983 P.2d 626 (1999):</b> - This case deals with surface water management but establishes the notion of a landlord's
    duty in water management, reinforcing the importance of maintaining habitable conditions within rental properties.
    <br/><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>3. Wilber Development Corp. v. Les Rowland Constr., Inc., 83 Wn.2d 871, 523 P.2d 186 (1974):</b> - This case explores the liability of developers and
    contractors in water damage situations, which can also be relevant when discussing a landlord’s responsibility for water intrusion due to construction defects or maintenance failures.
    <br/><br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>4. Yakima Fruit & Cold Storage Co. v. Central Heating & Plumbing Co., 81 Wn.2d 528, 403 P.2d 728 (1972):</b> - This case involves property damage due to
    alleged defects in installation and maintenance, paralleling issues of water leakage and the subsequent landlord responsibility for maintaining habitable conditions.
    <br/><br/>
    These cases collectively reinforce the landlord’s duty to ensure the property remains habitable, free of water damage, and to take necessary measures to prevent such issues,
    aligning with Washington State's landlord-tenant laws which impose an implied warranty of habitability and the responsibility for maintaining rented properties in a fit state.
