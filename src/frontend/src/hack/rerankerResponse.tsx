    Based on the cases you mentioned, the prominent legal precedents in Washington related to water leaking into an apartment from the floor above and involving damages to property or interference with tenants' use can be categorized as follows:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1. Tenant-Landlord Liability:</b>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Geise v. Lee, 84 Wn.2d 866 (1975): Recognizes that landlords have an affirmative duty to maintain common areas, including ensuring that they are free from hazards such as accumulations of snow and ice. This case supports the idea that landlords have a duty to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• McCutcheon v. United Homes Corp., 79 Wn.2d 443 (1971): Expanded landlord's responsibilities, stating that the landlord cannot passively refrain from negligent conduct and has an affirmative obligation to keep common areas in a reasonably safe condition.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Reardon v. Shimelman, 102 Conn. 383 (1925): This case implied that landlords may be held accountable for failing to address water leaks and other hazards in the premises they control.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>2. Implied Warranty of Habitability:</b>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Javins v. First Nat'l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970): Established that residential leases carry an implied warranty of habitability, meaning that premises must be livable and free from hazards. This includes the duty to repair water leaks that may damage property or interfere with tenants’ enjoyment.
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>3. Damages and Injunctions in Property Cases:</b>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Woldson v. Woodhead, 129 Wn. App. 1009 (2005): Involved ongoing damages from continuous trespass and recognized that continuing damages might require successive lawsuits, emphasizing the importance of addressing property damage promptly and effectively.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Donworth v. St. Paul Etc. R. Co., 39 Wash. 355 (1905): Established that negligence could be considered in landlord-tenant disputes, specifically in maintaining common areas like stairways, which can extend to maintaining plumbing systems to prevent leaks.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>4. Landlord’s Obligation to Address Water Leaks:</b>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Senske v. Washington Gas & Elec. Co., 165 Wash. 1 (1931): Held that utilities, including water, need to be maintained to prevent property damage, reinforcing that landlords need to maintain functional and safe premises.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Evans v. Seattle, 182 Wash. 450 (1935): Discussed the responsibilities of landowners and municipalities regarding water drainage and damages caused by improper maintenance of water systems.

    From these precedents, it’s clear that Washington law places a strong responsibility on landlords to maintain premises in a safe condition and remedy hazards such as water leaks promptly. Failure to do so may constitute a breach of the implied warranty of habitability, negligence, and could result in damages or injunctive relief. Tenants affected by water leaks from the floor above can potentially seek redress for damages under these principles.
