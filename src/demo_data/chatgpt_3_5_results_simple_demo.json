        "content": "In Washington State, there are several legal precedents and relevant doctrines concerning property damage resulting from water leakage or damage caused by water leaks from an adjacent or above unit. Here are some prominent cases and doctrines:\n\n1. **Common Enemy Doctrine and Its Exceptions**:\n   - The **Common Enemy Doctrine** generally allows property owners to protect their property from surface water, even if this causes damage to neighboring properties.\n   - **Exceptions to the Common Enemy Doctrine**: Washington courts have adopted certain exceptions that limit the doctrine's application, particularly concerning artificial collection and discharge of water in quantities or manners different from the natural flow. Some relevant cases include:\n     - **Wilber Development Corp. v. Les Rowland Constr., Inc.** (83 Wn.2d 871, 1974): The court held that municipalities are liable if they collect surface water by artificial means and discharge it in a manner that causes substantial injury to private property.\n     - **Washington Hydroculture, Inc. v. Payne** (96 Wash. 2d 322, 1981): The court discussed lessee's responsibility under a general maintenance and delivery clause but found that rebuilding after destruction by fire through no fault of the lessee was not required without an express covenant to that effect.\n\n2. **Cases Related to Water Damage**:\n   - **United Mutual Savings Bank v. Riebli** (55 Wash. 2d 816, 1960): This case addressed the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur concerning water damage caused by a ruptured pipe. The court found that the tenants were not liable for the damage caused by a latent defect (the ruptured pipe) since it was installed before their occupancy and was not under their exclusive control.\n   - **Strickland v. City of Seattle** (62 Wash. 2d 912, 1963): The court held that a city is not negligent if it increases the flow of water through a natural drainway due to urban improvements like streets and catch basins unless the drainage is increased beyond the capacity of the natural watercourse.\n   - **King County v. Boeing Co.** (62 Wash. 2d 545, 1963): The court addressed issues related to the artificial collection and discharge of surface waters and found that the discharge should not exceed natural flow without causing damage to adjacent properties.\n\n3. **Doctrine of Damnum Absque Injuria**:\n   - **Wilkening v. State** (54 Wn.2d 692, 1959): The court applied the doctrine of damnum absque injuria (damage without injury) where lawful actions on one's property (like improving it and protecting it from surface water) resulted in incidental damage to a neighboring property. The court held that such incidental damages do not constitute a legal injury requiring compensation.\n\nBased on these precedents, a person dealing with water leaking into an apartment from the floor above should consider the following steps:\n- Determine the source and cause of the leak (latent defect, negligence, etc.).\n- Review lease agreements and clauses related to maintenance, repairs, and liability for damage.\n- Assess whether the damage is due to an artificial collection and discharge of water that exceeds natural flows.\n- Evaluate the possibility of negligence or failure to properly maintain and repair the premises by the upstairs tenant or property management.\n\nConsulting a legal professional with experience in property and tenancy law in Washington can provide specific advice and help navigate the complexities of such cases.",
