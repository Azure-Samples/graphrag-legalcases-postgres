    "Dolliver, J.\nPlaintiff Mark Brown, while attempting to light an oil stove on December 31, 1978, unwittingly ignited natural gas which was leaking from a damaged gas line several blocks away. The natural gas, unable to permeate the frozen ground, traveled laterally entering the drain field which serviced Brown's residence. The leak allegedly was caused 7 years earlier when Cable Way, Inc. (Cable Way), while laying underground telephone cable for Pacific Northwest Bell (PNB), damaged a 2-inch gas transmission line owned by Washington Water Power Company (WWP). The subsequent explosion seriously injured Brown and destroyed the residence he rented from New Meadows Holding Company (New Meadows).\nPlaintiff New Meadows sued WWP, PNB, and Cable Way. WWP answered and sought indemnity by cross claim from PNB and Cable Way. PNB brought separate summary judgment motions for dismissal against New Meadows and WWP asserting the claim and cross claim were barred by the statutes of limitation in RCW 4.16.300-.320. New Meadows failed to appear and did not contest the motion. WWP appeared and resisted the motion. Both motions for dismissal were granted. New Meadows and WWP appealed.\nSubsequently, Brown and New Meadows sued WWP alleging liability based upon negligence and strict liability. They then filed a motion for summary judgment against WWP on the issue of strict liability. This motion was granted.\nCourt of Appeals, Division Three, granted discretionary review of the summary judgment order holding WWP strictly liable. This case and the appeals of New Meadows and WWP from the orders dismissing their actions against PNB were placed on a parallel perfection schedule and decided in a single opinion.\nIn New Meadows Holding Co. v. Washington Water Power Co., 34 Wn. App. 25, 659 P.2d 1113 (1983), Division Three held RCW 4.16.300-.320 did not apply to claims for damages to adjacent property and therefore reversed PNB's summary judgment on WWP's cross claim. The court, however, affirmed PNB's summary judgment against New Meadows, finding its failure to contest the motion amounted to waiver. Additionally, the court held the transmission of natural gas through underground lines was not an abnormally dangerous activity. Therefore, the summary judgment against WWP on the issue of strict liability was reversed. Plaintiffs' petition for discretionary review was granted.\nI\nInitially, we must determine whether the failure of New Meadows to contest PNB's motion for summary judgment waived its right to appeal. Failure to raise an issue before the trial court generally precludes a party from raising it on appeal. Smith v. Shannon, 100 Wn.2d 26, 37, 666 P.2d 351 (1983). This rule affords the trial court an opportunity to rule correctly upon a matter before it can be presented on appeal. Lake Air, Inc. v. Duffy, 42 Wn.2d 478, 482, 256 P.2d 301 (1953). However, this rule does not apply when the question raised affects the right to maintain the action. Maynard Inv. Co. v. McCann, 77 Wn.2d 616, 621, 465 P.2d 657 (1970).\nSince to deem New Meadows' failure to appear as a waiver affects its right to maintain the action, New Meadows' claim falls squarely under the exception to the general rule. Moreover, the trial court was not deprived of an opportunity to rule on the applicability of RCW 4.16.300-.320 to this case. PNB's motions for summary judgment, based on these statutory provisions, were adequately briefed and argued by PNB and WWP. New Meadows and WWP had identical interests. Thus, New Meadows' argument was not raised for the first time on appeal. We reverse the lower court's summary judgment dismissal of New Meadows' claim.\nII\nNext, at issue is whether New Meadows' claim and WWP's cross claim against PNB are barred by RCW 4.16-.300-320. RCW 4.16.300-.320 apply to all claims or causes of action arising from construction, alteration, or repair of any improvement upon real property. RCW 4.16.310 states such claims\nshall accrue, and the applicable statute of limitation shall begin to run only during the period within six years after substantial completion of construction . . . Any cause of action which has not accrued within six years . . . shall be barred: Provided, That this limitation shall not be asserted as a defense by any owner, tenant or other person in possession and control of the improvement at the time such cause of action accrues.\nThe Court of Appeals, relying on Vern J. Oja & Assocs. v. Washington Park Towers, Inc., 89 Wn.2d 72, 569 P.2d 1141 (1977), held the statute did not apply to claims for damages to adjacent property. We disagree. Oja held, under the 3-year statute of limitation in RCW 4.16.080(1), the discovery rule determines when a cause of action accrues in cases involving damage to real property arising out of construction on adjacent property.\nThis holding has no impact on the absolute limitation on actions defined in RCW 4.16.310. Gazija v. Nicholas Jems Co., 86 Wn.2d 215, 222 n.2, 543 P.2d 338 (1975); Hudesman v. Meriwether Leachman Assocs., Inc., 35 Wn. App. 318, 320-23, 666 P.2d 937 (1983). This statute begins to run upon substantial completion of a project, not upon the accrual of a claim. In fact, the statute runs against the accrual of any claim arising from the project. Consequently, for a claim to be heard, it must accrue within 6 years. Additionally, RCW 4.16.310 applies to all claims of causes of action arising from the activities covered. The focus is upon the cause of the damage, not its location. We conclude, therefore, the statute applies equally to claims arising from adjacent property.\nThe proviso of RCW 4.16.310, however, which prohibits an owner, tenant, or other person in possession and control of the improvement from asserting the limitation as a defense, removes PNB from the terms of the statute. PNB, as owner of the telephone cable, falls within the proviso. The claims of New Meadows and WWP are not barred by RCW 4.16.300-.320.\nIll\nWashington, as well as all other jurisdictions in the United States, applies a negligence standard to the underground piping of gas. See Richey & Gilbert Co. v. Northwestern Natural Gas Corp., 16 Wn.2d 631, 134 P.2d 444 (1943); Senske v. Washington Gas & Elec. Co., 165 Wash. 1, 4 P.2d 523 (1931); Annot., Liability of Gas Company for Personal Injury or Property Damage Caused by Gas Escaping From Mains in Street, 96 A.L.R.2d 1007 (1964 & Supp. 1983). Plaintiffs urge us to reexamine this doctrine and adopt the rule that the transmission of natural gas through underground lines is an abnormally dangerous activity upon which strict liability should be imposed.\nStrict liability is imposed when the conditions of Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 519, 520 (1977) are met. Pacific Northwest Bell Tel. Co. v. Port of Seattle, 80 Wn.2d 59, 64, 491 P.2d 1037 (1971) (holding underground water mains do not constitute an abnormal condition warranting strict liability). Section 519 provides for the imposition of strict liability upon those who are carrying on an \"abnormally dangerous activity\". Whether an activity is abnormally dangerous is a question of law for the court to decide. Langan v. Valicopters, Inc., 88 Wn.2d 855, 861, 567 P.2d 218 (1977).\nSection 520 lists the factors to be considered when determining what constitutes an abnormally dangerous activity:\n(a) existence of a high degree of risk of some harm to the person, land or chattels of others;\n(b) likelihood that the harm that results from it will be great;\n(c) inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care;\n(d) extent to which the activity is not a matter of common usage;\n(e) inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried on; and\n(f) extent to which its value to the community is outweighed by its dangerous attributes.\nAn examination of these factors as they apply to the facts persuades us, as it did the Court of Appeals, that strict liability should not be imposed in this case.\nIt is conceded with regard to factors (a) and (b), that the volatile and highly explosive nature of natural gas potentially presents a high degree of risk of great harm. The invisibility of natural gas increases the risk of injury in that it decreases the likelihood escaping gas will be detected. As to factor (c), the phrase \"the risk\" plainly refers to the \"high degree of risk\" mentioned in factor (a). Thus, factor (c) addresses itself to the question of whether, through the exercise of ordinary care, the risk inherent in an activity can be reduced to the point where it can no longer be characterized as a \"high degree of risk\".\nSome degree of risk of natural gas pipeline leaks will always be present. This does not mean, however, that the \"high degree of risk\" with which section 520 is concerned cannot be eliminated by the use of reasonable care with regard to the dangerous character of the commodity. See, e.g., Fields v. Western Ky. Gas Co., 478 S.W.2d 20, 22-23 (Ky. 1972); Bubrick v. Northern Ill. Gas Co., 130 Ill. App. 2d 99, 107-08, 264 N.E.2d 560 (1970). Gas companies are subject to strict federal and state safety regulations. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 717, 719; 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1671-1686; 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 192 (1983); WAC 480-93. Programs for corrosion control, pipeline testing, gas leak investigation, and awareness of construction work near gas company facilities must be maintained. WAC 480-93-110, -170, -185, -190. Odorizers are placed in the gas itself to increase the likelihood of detection in those rare instances when natural gas does escape. In light of all this, we believe the high degree of risk involved in the transmission of natural gas through underground lines can be eliminated by the use of reasonable care and legislative safeguards.\nFactors (d), (e), and (f) clearly weigh against imposition of strict liability. The underground transmission of gas is a matter of common usage which is appropriate to the place where it is carried on. In their brief, amici curiae on behalf of the American Gas Association estimate approximately 160 million people use gas for residential needs. About 35 percent of the total energy used by industry is provided by natural gas, United States Dep't of Energy Information Admin., Monthly Energy Review 23 (December 18, 1981); and 720,900 miles of distribution pipelines crisscross communities in every state and the District of Columbia, including 10,062 miles in Washington state. American Gas Ass'n, Gas Facts, 1982 Data 61, 63 (1983). Hence, it is entirely appropriate and necessary for communities to have gas lines placed underground.\nNew Meadows relies upon Siegler v. Kuhlman, 81 Wn.2d 448, 502 P.2d 1181 (1972), cert. denied, 411 U.S. 983 (1973) (strict liability imposed on hauling gasoline in commercial quantities as freight upon public highways). Siegler, however, is easily distinguishable. The court in Siegler stated:\nStored in commercial quantities, gasoline has been recognized to be a substance of such dangerous characteristics that it invites a rule of strict liability \u2014 even where the hazard is contamination to underground water supply and not its more dangerous properties such as its explosiveness and flammability. It is even more appropriate, therefore, to apply this principle to the more highly hazardous act of transporting it as freight upon the freeways and public thoroughfares.\n(Citation omitted.) Siegler, at 457. The underground transmission of natural gas presents a significant contrast to the activity at issue in Siegler. Natural gas flows through a small (2-inch) pipe which is buried underground, away from the dangers of the surface world. There are no careless drivers, faulty brakes, or slippery roads with which to contend. The heightened danger resulting from the storage of a highly volatile substance in large commercial quantities, rolling at high speed on a well traveled highway, is also absent.\nFurthermore, where there is the intervention of an \"outside force beyond the control of the manufacturer, the owner, or the operator of the vehicle hauling [the gasoline]\", the rule of strict liability should not apply. Siegler, at 460 (Rosellini, J., concurring). Here, the gas leak was allegedly caused when a contractor laying underground telephone cable for Pacific Northwest Bell damaged a 2-inch gas transmission line owned by defendant. Neither in its facts nor in its law does Siegler apply to this case.\nWe affirm the holding of the Court of Appeals that the transmission of natural gas through underground lines is not an \"abnormally dangerous activity\" upon which strict liability should be imposed, and reverse New Meadows' summary judgment against Washington Water Power on that issue. The case is remanded for trial on the issue of whether Washington Water Power exercised a degree of care commensurate to the danger involved in transmitting natural gas.\nUtter, Brachtenbach, and Dimmick, JJ., and Morgan, J. Pro Tern., concur."

    "Ott, J.\nOctober 30,1954, the Washington Building Company leased \u201cthat certain store space known as 1025 Pacific Avenue,\u201d in Tacoma, Washington, to Donald H. Hutch-ins for an ice cream and soda fountain business. November 30, 1955, the lease was assigned to Arthur A. Riebli and George Hoertrich, Jr., with the consent of the building company. During the weekend prior to October 29, 1956, a water pipe imbedded in the cementlike floor of the leased premises ruptured. Monday morning at 7:30 a. m., the maintenance superintendent of the building company discovered that the basement of the building had been flooded. The flow of water from the ruptured pipe was shut off by a valve which controlled the service of water to the leased premises. The water caused damage to some doors stored by the building company in a basement storeroom, to merchandise stored by the Washington Camera Mart in its basement storeroom, and to a rug on the floor in the basement safe-deposit vault lobby of the United Mutual Savings Bank.\nThe Washington Camera Mart brought suit against Riebli and Hoertrich to recover for its loss. The bank sued Riebli, Hoertrich, and the building company. The building company cross-complained against Riebli and Hoertrich for damages to its doors and for indemnity for any damages it might be required to pay to the bank. The causes were consolidated for trial.\nThe court entered judgment for both plaintiffs and also entered judgment for the building company on its cross-complaint. Riebli and Hoertrich have appealed.\nThe evidence disclosed, inter alia, (1) that the respondents\u2019 premises were damaged by water; (2) that the water came from a ruptured pipe imbedded in the cementlike floor of the premises leased by the appellants; (3) that the pipe was installed in 1947, with the consent of the building company, by a former tenant when he remodeled the premises, and had since remained untouched; (4) that water was supplied by the building company to the appellants\u2019 premises through a system of pipes which it maintained and over which it retained control, the water being piped to a reservoir on the top floor of the building and from there to the various parts of the building; (5) that the appellants were not assignees of Fox, who had installed the pipe, but were in possession as the assignees of the Hutchins lease, and (6) that the lease provided that the tenants had the duty to keep the leased premises in repair and, under certain conditions, to save the building company harmless from occupational liability.\nThe court predicated appellants\u2019 liability to the Washington Camera Mart and to the bank upon the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. The court erred in applying the doctrine to the facts of this case.\nBefore the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur can be applied, exclusive control of the offending instrumentality by the appellants must be established by the evidence. In this regard, Prosser on Torts (2d ed.) 204, \u00a7 42, states the rule as follows:\n\u201cIt is never enough for the plaintiff to prove merely that he has been injured by the negligence of someone unidentified. Even though there is beyond all possible doubt negligence in the air, it is still necessary to bring it home to the defendant. On this too the plaintiff has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence; and in any case where it is clear that it is at least equally probable that the negligence was that of another, the court must instruct the jury that the plaintiff has not proved his case. . . .\n\u201cThis element usually is stated as meaning that the defendant must be in \u2018exclusive control\u2019 of the instrumentality which has caused the accident. . . .\n\u201c. . . It would be far better, and much confusion would be avoided, if the idea of \u2018control\u2019 were discarded altogether, and we were to say merely that the apparent cause of the accident must be such that the defendant would be responsible for any negligence connected with it.\u201d\nIn Morner v. Union Pac. R. Co., 31 Wn. (2d) 282, 294, 196 P. (2d) 744 (1948), this court said:\n\u201c . . . one of the elements essential to the invocation of that doctrine [res ipsa loquitur] is that the party charged with actionable negligence must have sole and exclusive control of the agency or instrumentality which actually caused the injury. If there is no such exclusive control, or if the injury was caused, or may reasonably be said to have been caused, by the concurrent acts of two or more persons or agencies functioning independently of each other, the doctrine does not apply.\u201d\nAccord, 1 Shearman and Redfield, Negligence (Rev. ed.) 153, \u00a7 56; 65 C. J. S. 1014 et seq., \u00a7 220 (8).\nIn Hogland v. Klein, 49 Wn. (2d) 216, 298 P. (2d) 1099 (1956), we recognized that the requirement of control does not mean actual physical control, but refers to legal control or responsibility for the proper and efficient functioning of the instrumentality that caused the injury.\nUnder the facts of this case, was the offending pipe under the exclusive control of the appellants?\nRespondents rely upon Kind v. Seattle, 50 Wn. (2d) 485, 312 P. (2d) 811 (1957). In the cited case, a water main was held to be under the \u201cexclusive control\u201d of the city, when it was installed by the city, maintained by the city up to and at the time of the accident, and the water was supplied by the city. See, also, Klise v. Seattle, 52 Wn. (2d) 412, 325 P. (2d) 888 (1958).\nIn the instant case, the appellants did not install the offending pipe. They did not select the kind or quality of pipe used. They had no control over the water supply. The evidence failed to establish the element of \u201cexclusive control,\u201d which is a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\nFurther, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is based in part upon the theory that negligence will be presumed because the defendant either knew of the cause of the accident, or had the best opportunity of ascertaining the cause and, therefore, should be required to produce evidence in explanation. Shay v. Parkhurst, 38 Wn. (2d) 341, 229 P. (2d) 510 (1951); Morner v. Union Pac. R. Co., supra; Lynch v. Ninemire Packing Co., 63 Wash. 423, 115 Pac. 838 (1911).\nIn this case, there was no proof that the appellants had prior knowledge of the cause of the accident or that they had the best opportunity to know of it. When they took possession of the premises, the imbedded pipe was in place and had remained there untouched during their occupancy.\nThere remains the question of whether the judgment in favor of the Washington Building Company and against the appellants can be sustained because of the following provisions of the lease:\n\u201cThe Parties Hereto Further Agree, As Follows: . . .\n\u201c(2) Throughout the term of this lease, the Lessee will take good care of the demised premises and appurtenances, alterations and improvements, and will keep same in good repair, and at or before the end of the term will repair all injury done by the installation or removal of equipment and fixtures, it being understood that the Lessee shall have the right to remove equipment and fixtures; and, at the end of the term, the Lessee will quit and surrender the demised premises, with all alterations and improvements, in good order and condition, reasonable wear and damage by the elements excepted. . . .\n\u201c(6) The Lessor shall not be liable for damage caused the Lessee by bursting or leaking of any water, gas, or steam pipe by accident or by neglect of other tenants or occupants of the building or their employees. . . .\n\u201c (8) The Lessor shall have the right to enter the premises at reasonable times and intervals to examine the same or to make repairs or alterations. . . .\n\u201c(11) The Lessee agrees to use the leased premises as a careful and prudent person would use his own, and upon the expiration of the term to surrender the premises to the Lessor in as good condition as at the beginning of the term of this lease, save for wear and tear from reasonable and careful use. . . .\n\u201c (14) The Lessee shall keep, save and hold harmless the Lessor from any and all damages and liability for anything and everything whatsoever arising from, or out of the occupancy by, or under, the Lessee, the Lessee\u2019s agents or servants, and from any loss or damage arising from any fault or negligence by the Lessee, or any failure on the Lessee\u2019s part to comply with any of the covenants, terms and conditions herein contained, or otherwise, or whether it be caused by, or be due to, the failure of the Lessee to perform any of the covenants herein, expressed or implied, that are to be performed by the Lessee.\u201d\nRespondents rely upon \u00a7 14, supra. Liability under that section of the lease arises upon (1) appellants\u2019 failure to comply with the terms of the lease, and (2) damages arising from or out of appellants\u2019 occupancy of the premises.\nAs to (1), it was not shown that appellants failed to comply with the terms of the lease. Regarding (2), we are of the opinion that, construing the contract as a whole, the parties intended that the appellants were obligated to \u201ctake good care\u201d of the leased premises during their occupancy, and to make a reasonable and careful use thereof. They were liable only for damage caused by unreasonable and careless use of the premises. The imbedded pipe in some manner ruptured during the appellants\u2019 occupancy. The fact of the rupture alone does not establish that the use of the premises by the appellants was unreasonable or careless. The burden of proving that the water damage was caused by appellants\u2019 failure to comply with the terms and covenants of the lease, or by their unreasonable use of the premises, was not met by the respondents.\nNor does the covenant (\u00a72, supra) which placed upon the appellants the duty to repair make them insurers of latent defects in the premises. The covenant to repair carries with it no more than the duty to repair known defects or defects which could have been discovered by the exercise of due care. Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co., 79 Wash. 643, 140 Pac. 909 (1914); Bernhard v. Reeves, 6 Wash. 424, 33 Pac. 873 (1893).\nThere is no evidence in the record before us that the defect was known to the appellants or that appellants, by the exercise of due care, could have discovered it. The proof established nothing more than a latent defect for which appellants assumed no contractual liability.\nFinally, respondents contend that the offending pipe was a trade fixture. Assuming, arguendo, that the pipe, at the time it was installed by the then tenant, Fox, was a trade fixture and so regarded by Fox and the owner of the building, it lost its identity as a trade fixture and became part of the building when it was leased by the owner as a part of the over-all premises to the appellants\u2019 assignor, Hutchins.\n\u201c \u2018The true criterion of a fixture is the united application of these requisites: (1) Actual annexation to the realty, or something appurtenant thereto; (2) application to the use or purpose to which that part of the realty with which it is connected is appropriated; and (3) the intention of the party making the annexation to make a permanent accession to the freehold.\u2019 \u201d Forman v. Columbia Theater Co., 20 Wn. (2d) 685, 695, 148 P. (2d) 951 (1944), quoting with approval from Filley v. Christopher, 39 Wash. 22, 80 Pac. 834 (1905).\nApplying these tests to the facts in the instant case, the pipe was securely imbedded in the concretelike floor, and was applied to the use of these premises as an ice cream parlor and soda fountain. The actual intention of Fox, who made the annexation, does not appear, but, from the above and from the fact that he did not remove it at the termination of his lease, we must presume that his intention was to make the pipe a permanent annexation to the freehold. Under these facts, it is clear that the pipe became a permanent part of the building company\u2019s water supply system and was leased as a part of the freehold to appellants\u2019 assignor.\nFor the reasons stated, the judgments are reversed, and the causes remanded with instructions to enter judgments dismissing the complaints and the cross-complaint.\nWeaver, C. J., Hill, Donworth, Finley, and Foster, JJ., concur."

    "\u00b61 In 1997, the city of Pasco enacted Pasco Ordinance 3231, which requires landlords to submit certification every two years ensuring that their rental units have met all applicable health, safety, and building code requirements. The certification must be signed by a city enforcement officer, a certified private inspector, or a Washington licensed private structural engineer or architect. The petitioners, both landlords and tenants, challenge the constitutionality of Pasco Ordinance 3231, arguing that on its face it violates article I, section 7 of the Washington Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United\nBridge, J.\nStates Constitution. The petitioners also argue that the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague.\n\u00b62 We hold that Pasco Ordinance 3231 does not require state action and, therefore, neither article I, section 7 nor the Fourth Amendment is implicated. We also recognize that the ordinance does not require any inspection that landlords are not already permitted to undertake by existing law. Finally, we hold that Pasco Ordinance 3231 is not unconstitutionally vague. We affirm the Court of Appeals.\nI\nFacts and Procedural History\n\u00b63 In the 1990s, the city of Pasco faced problems with a number of substandard rental housing units. For example, the landlords involved in this case owned rental units for which there was no working source of heat. Tenants were told they had to provide their own heat via portable electric space heaters. In addition, kitchens contained no vent, hood, fan, or window, despite the fact that natural gas was used to heat them. In one building, windows were not properly installed, allowing weather to enter the wall. Plumbing was in such disrepair that a bucket had to be used to catch water draining from a bathroom sink. One unit was infested with cockroaches. Some units had unsound wall finishes and warped or buckled walls.\n\u00b64 One of Bernard and Jean Shaw\u2019s tenants complained that they were refusing to make necessary repairs to her apartment. For some time, neither the heat nor the air conditioning worked. The doors did not open unless she resorted to using a knife or plastic card. Both the bathroom and kitchen sinks drained into buckets. The shower wall was collapsing and the kitchen and bathroom floors were rotting. When the tenant demanded either repairs, placement into a better rental unit, or refund of her deposit so she could move out, the apartment manager told her that if she continued to complain, he would have her deported.\n\u00b65 The city council sought to take steps to remedy these and similar situations. In July 1997, after public hearings involving testimony from both tenants and landlords, the city council passed Pasco Ordinance 3231. The ordinance regulates business licenses for residential landlords.\n\u00b66 The ordinance provides that a landlord must obtain a current business license. As a condition for the issuance of a license, the landlord must provide a certificate of inspection ensuring that\nthe applicant\u2019s rental dwelling units comply with the standards of the Uniform Housing Code and do not present conditions that endanger or impair the health or safety of a tenant including:\n(1) structural members that are insufficient in size or strength to carry imposed loads with safety;\n(2) exposure of the occupants to the weather;\n(3) plumbing and sanitation defects that directly expose the occupants to the risk of illness or injury;\n(4) lack of water, including hot water;\n(5) heating or ventilation systems that are not functional or are hazardous;\n(6) defective, hazardous, or missing electrical wiring or electrical service;\n(7) defective or inadequate exits that increase the risk of injury to occupants;\n(8) violations that increase the risk of fire; or\n(9) violations of other applicable codes, rules or regulations.\nClerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 296. Landlords must provide a certificate of inspection during a preassigned three-month period every two years. The certificate must be based on the physical inspection of the dwelling not more than 90 days before the date of the certificate. Compliance must be certified by one of the following:\n(1) a City of Pasco Code Enforcement Officer;\n(2) inspectors certified by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development for grant-required inspections;\n(3) certified private inspectors approved by the City upon evidence of completion of formal training . . . ;\n(4) a Washington licensed structural engineer;\n(5) a Washington licensed architect.\nCP at 297. All certifications must be submitted on forms provided by the city or approved by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. The city provides the services of its building inspector free of charge, or the landlord can use a private inspector that meets one of the qualifications listed above. Nothing in the ordinance prevents additional inspections pursuant to RCW 59.18.115 at the request of the tenant. Landlords that fail to comply are guilty of a code infraction, subjecting them to a fine of up to $500. A separate code infraction can be found for each day that the violations continue.\n\u00b67 In 1999, the Shaws failed to provide the city of Pasco with a certificate of inspection for some of their rental units. As a result, they were not issued a business license, but they continued to rent the affected units. The city filed an action against the Shaws in superior court. In response, the Shaws asserted that tenants occupying some of their rental units had refused to permit \u201cunauthorized searches of their home.\u201d CP at 8. The Shaws argued that absent a warrant, they could not permit a third party to inspect their tenants\u2019 homes. They also argued that Pasco Ordinance 3231 violates the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and article I, section 7 of the Washington Constitution because it requires inspection of rental units even if the tenants do not consent and the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague.\n\u00b68 An association of landlords, some tenants, and the Shaws then filed an action in federal district court, chai-lenging the constitutionality of the Pasco ordinance under the Fourth Amendment. The state case was stayed during the pendency of the federal case. The federal district court granted summary judgment to the city, concluding that landlords and their privately engaged inspectors were not state actors and therefore their inspection pursuant to the ordinance did not violate the Fourth Amendment. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit vacated the district court\u2019s order, holding that the federal court should not have exercised its jurisdiction until the state court had resolved the challenges. Columbia Basin Apartment Ass\u2019n v. City of Pasco, 268 F.3d 791, 806-07 (9th Cir. 2001). The Ninth Circuit ordered the federal district court to stay federal proceedings until state courts determined the validity of the ordinance.\n\u00b69 The Franklin County Superior Court then allowed four tenants to intervene in the state case in order to raise constitutional challenges to the ordinance under the Fourth Amendment and article I, section 7. The intervenors filed their own motion for summary judgment, arguing that Pasco Ordinance 3231 violates article I, section 7 of the Washington Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The superior court then granted summary judgment to the city, concluding that Pasco Ordinance 3231 does not invade tenants\u2019 privacy rights under either the United States or Washington Constitutions. Specifically, the trial court concluded that the ordinance did not transform landlords and their private inspectors into state actors, and limited inspection for the purpose of determining compliance with housing codes did not amount to an unreasonable search.\n\u00b610 The Shaws and the tenants petitioned for direct review in this court. We denied direct review and transferred the case to the Court of Appeals. City of Pasco v. Shaw, 127 Wn. App. 417, 421-22, 110 P.3d 1200 (2005). The Court of Appeals affirmed, also concluding that the ordinance is not unconstitutional because the landlords and their private inspectors are not state actors and the tenants\u2019 privacy rights are not offended by the required inspections. The Court of Appeals also held that the ordinance is not unconstitutionally vague. Petitioners sought review in this court, which we granted.\nII\nAnalysis\n\u00b611 The Shaws and the intervenors have challenged the constitutionality of Pasco Ordinance 3231 on its face. In order to prevail, they must show that the ordinance is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt and there are no factual circumstances under which the ordinance could be constitutional. Citizens for Responsible Wildlife Mgmt. v. State, 149 Wn.2d 622, 631, 71 P.3d 644 (2003); Tunstall v. Bergeson, 141 Wn.2d 201, 221, 5 P.3d 691 (2000). Whether the petitioners have met this high burden is a question that we review de novo. Shoop v. Kittitas County, 149 Wn.2d 29, 33, 65 P.3d 1194 (2003).\n\u00b612 The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.\u201d Under the Fourth Amendment, to determine whether a search has occurred, we ask whether the government action invaded a \u201cjustifiable, reasonable, or legitimate expectation of privacy.\u201d State v. Carter, 151 Wn.2d 118, 127, 85 P.3d 887 (2004).\n\u00b613 Article I, section 7 of the Washington Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be disturbed in his private affairs, or his home invaded, without authority of law.\u201d Article I, section 7 bestows upon Washington citizens protections that are \u201cqualitatively different from, and in some cases broader than, those provided by the Fourth Amendment.\u201d City of Seattle v. McCready, 123 Wn.2d 260, 267, 868 P.2d 134 (1994) (McCready I). Article I, section 7 recognizes privacy interests that Washington citizens have held, or should be entitled to hold, free from government intrusion. Carter, 151 Wn.2d at 126.\n\u00b614 In 1994, this court examined a Seattle residential housing inspection program in which city inspectors sought to inspect rental properties for housing code violations over tenant objection. McCready I, 123 Wn.2d at 264-65. This court concluded, in the context of inspection by government officials, that nonconsensual inspection of residential rental units invaded the tenants\u2019 private affairs and that no authority of law supported warrants to search for housing code violations absent probable cause. Id. at 271,280-81. In response, the city began to obtain administrative inspection warrants supported by probable cause that a housing violation had occurred. City of Seattle v. McCready, 124 Wn.2d 300, 309, 877 P.2d 686 (1994) (McCready II). Then in McCready II, we explained that municipal courts had no inherent authority to issue administrative search warrants, and thus, they had to rely on an authorizing statute or court rule. Id. No statute or court rule allowed administrative inspection supported by probable cause to believe a civil, but not a criminal, infraction had occurred. Id. In Bosteder v. City of Renton, 155 Wn.2d 18, 23-24, 117 P.3d 316 (2005), we concluded that the same result is required under the Fourth Amendment. Administrative search warrants must be supported by an authorizing statute or court rule or by allegations of a criminal violation supported by probable cause. See id. at 29.\n\u00b615 Because the McCready cases and Bosteder involved searches conducted by city inspectors, these cases do not answer the question presented here: whether the Fourth Amendment or article I, section 7 is violated where a landlord and a privately engaged inspector inspect a rental property for code violations that impact health and safety.\n\u00b616 Both the Fourth Amendment and article I, section 7 provide strict privacy protections where invasion of a person\u2019s home is involved. However, unless the person conducting the inspection is a state actor, no violation of these constitutional provisions occurs. E.g., Carter, 151 Wn.2d at 124; In re Pers. Restraint of Maxfield, 133 Wn.2d 332, 337, 945 P.2d 196 (1997). It is the party asserting the unconstitutionality of an action that bears the burden of establishing that state action is involved. E.g., State v. Swenson, 104 Wn. App. 744, 754, 9 P.3d 933 (2000) (citing State v. Walter, 66 Wn. App. 862, 866, 833 P.2d 440 (1992)).\n\u00b617 Whether state action has occurred depends on the circumstances of a given case. E.g., id. (quoting State v. Clark, 48 Wn. App. 850, 856, 743 P.2d 822 (1987)); see also State v. Thetford, 109 Wn.2d 392, 401, 745 P.2d 496 (1987). A person is a state actor if that person functions as an agent or instrumentality of the state. Walter, 66 Wn. App. at 866 (citing Clark, 48 Wn. App. at 856). In making this determination, Washington courts look to \u201cthe capacity in which [a person] acts at the time of the search\u201d rather than to the person\u2019s primary occupation. State v. Ludvik, 40 Wn. App. 257, 262-63, 698 P.2d 1064 (1985). \u201c \u2018Critical factors . . . include [1] whether the government knew of and acquiesced in the intrusive conduct and [2] whether the party performing the search intended to assist law enforcement efforts or to further his [or her] own ends.\u2019 \u201d Swenson, 104 Wn. App. at 754 (emphasis added) (some alterations in original) (quoting Clark, 48 Wn. App. at 856).\n\u00b618 The Pasco ordinance requires a landlord to submit a certificate of inspection, but it does not authorize the city itself to search for housing violations. The petitioners point to Kuehn v. Renton School District No. 403, 103 Wn.2d 594, 600, 694 P.2d 1078 (1985), in which we held that parent chaperones of a high school student trip acted with enforcement authority of school officials when they searched student bags. However, under the Pasco ordinance a landlord can engage private inspectors in order to further the private objective of obtaining a certification needed to maintain a business license. Significantly, if a private inspector finds code violations, the ordinance does not require the inspector to turn his or her findings over to the city. Thus, a landlord can remedy any violations found by an independent inspector, submit to another inspection, and obtain a license based on the new inspection, without the city ever being notified of the original violations. The city insists only upon the certificate that an inspection has been successfully completed. Landlords first and foremost further their own ends when they engage in the inspections contemplated by the ordinance. In sum, the petitioners have not met their burden of showing that landlords and their privately engaged inspectors are state actors. Absent state action, neither the Fourth Amendment nor article I, section 7 was violated.\n\u00b619 We also note that RCW 59.18.150(1) already provides that a tenant cannot unreasonably withhold consent to the landlord to enter into the rental unit in order to inspect the premises, and the act allows some third parties to accompany the landlord upon entrance. In Kalmas v. Wagner, 133 Wn.2d 210, 219-20, 943 P.2d 1369 (1997), this court reasoned that if the scope of a landlord\u2019s entrance does not exceed the legitimate purposes contemplated by the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973 (RLTA), chapter 59.18 RCW, no unreasonable search has occurred. Of course, the RLTA provides some limitations to landlord entry. A landlord, accompanied by his or her chosen inspector, cannot enter without at least two days\u2019 notice to the tenant, and they must enter at a reasonable time. RCW 59.18.150(5). In addition, the inspection necessary to fulfill the requirements of the Pasco ordinance is limited to a survey for the ordinance\u2019s habitability requirements. Neither landlords nor their privately engaged inspectors are permitted to search a tenant\u2019s belongings or search for evidence of a crime. The ordinance contemplates no assistance to law enforcement in the form of uncovering any illegal acts on the part of tenants. See Swenson, 104 Wn. App. at 754. The inspection required by Pasco Ordinance 3231 does not exceed what is already allowed by the RLTA.\n\u00b620 Under these circumstances, entry into a rental unit necessary to obtain a certificate required to renew a business license is a private action that is intended to benefit the landlord. Nor have the Shaws shown that the ordinance transforms landlords and their chosen inspectors into state actors. There being no state action, there is no article I, section 7 or Fourth Amendment violation. *3 Furthermore, the Pasco ordinance does not require anything that is not already permitted by law.\n\u00b621 Finally, petitioners argue that Pasco Ordinance 3231 is unconstitutionally vague. We presume that ordinances are constitutional, and the party challenging the ordinance must prove vagueness beyond a reasonable doubt. City of Seattle v. Eze, 111 Wn.2d 22, 26, 759 P.2d 366 (1988). An ordinance is unconstitutionally vague if \u201cpersons \u2018of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application\u2019.\u201d Haley v. Med. Disciplinary Bd., 117 Wn.2d 720, 739, 818 P.2d 1062 (1991) (quoting Connally v. Gen. Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S. Ct. 126, 70 L. Ed. 322 (1926)). The ordinance need not meet impossible standards of specificity. Eze, 111 Wn.2d at 26. An ordinance is constitutional if it provides adequate notice of prohibited conduct and prevents arbitrary, discretionary enforcement. Haley, 111 Wn.2d at 739-40.\n\u00b622 As noted above, Pasco Ordinance 3231 lists nine habitability requirements that landlords must certify. The petitioners challenge the ninth requirement: that no conditions exist that constitute \u201cviolations of other applicable codes, rules or regulations.\u201d CP at 296. The petitioners claim that this requirement gives inspectors broad discretion to choose and apply unspecified standards.\n\u00b623 However, the language of the ordinance is not so vague that an ordinary person would not understand its meaning. The requirement at issue occurs in the context of a list of specific habitability requirements, and it is limited to \u201capplicable\u201d codes, rules, and regulations. Arbitrary discretion is limited by the standards set forth in relevant housing codes and regulations. The petitioners have not met the heavy burden of showing vagueness beyond a reasonable doubt.\nIll\nConclusion\n\u00b624 Pasco Ordinance 3231 was enacted in an attempt to protect tenants and nearby property owners from dangerous and unhealthy housing conditions. The inspections contemplated by the ordinance do not amount to state action, nor does the ordinance require any intrusion not already permitted by the RLTA. Finally, Pasco Ordinance 3231 is not unconstitutionally vague. We therefore conclude that the petitioners have not met their heavy burden of proving Pasco Ordinance 3231 unconstitutional, and we affirm the Court of Appeals.\nC. Johnson, Madsen, Owens, and Fairhurst, JJ., concur.\nThis provides a good example of why some tenants may hesitate to report housing code violations.\nPetitioners point to the provision of the RLTA allowing fire officials to seek a warrant for inspection upon a showing of probable cause that criminal fire code violations exist in a specific dwelling. RCW 59.18.150(2). Petitioners claim that this provision provides an example of \u201cauthority of law\u201d necessary to justify invasion of tenants\u2019 privacy interests, and absent a similar provision, city inspectors cannot enter rental units without tenant consent. However, this argument ignores the fact that the Pasco ordinance requires landlords to provide certification from privately engaged inspectors. No city official is authorized to enter the rental dwelling under the ordinance.\nIn addition, in order to successfully mount a facial challenge, the petitioners must show there are no factual "

    "\u00b61\nMadsen, J.\nIn these consolidated cases, the trial courts dismissed actions for breach of construction contracts as untimely. The Court of Appeals reversed in each case, holding that the discovery rule applies to determine when a cause of action accrues for breach of a construction contract and that material issues of fact exist as to when the plaintiffs discovered their causes of action. The Court of Appeals also held that RCW 4.16.326, which provides an affirmative defense, does not apply retroactively. The defendant construction companies challenge the Court of Appeals\u2019 holdings that the discovery rule applies and that RCW 4.16.326 is not retroactive. We affirm the Court of Appeals.\nFACTS\n\u00b62 In 1000 Virginia Limited Partnership v. Vertecs Corp., 127 Wn. App. 899, 112 P.3d 1276 (2005), 1000 Virginia, acting as its own general contractor, built an apartment complex. 1000 Virginia hired subcontractor Vertecs Corporation to do the stucco work. Vertecs was not responsible for caulking, flashings, and weather protection. On December 31,1992, the certificate of substantial completion was issued. Occasional leaks occurred, and in early 1994 1000 Virginia asked for Vertecs\u2019 presence during inspection of windows and vents. Following inspection, Vertecs concluded that caulking had failed in several areas and that some dryer vents were not connected to ductwork. Vertecs said these problems were not within the scope of its work. 1000 Virginia repaired the caulking and ductwork. Leaks continued over the next few years, and after a wet winter in 1996, 1000 Virginia noted increased cracks in the stucco and deterioration in drywall under decks. 1000 Virginia took further corrective action. Despite 1000 Virginia\u2019s efforts to resolve the problems, by the end of 1998, 1000 Virginia knew substantial repairs were required to correct systemic defects that led to structural damage resulting from water intrusion and fungal problems.\n\u00b63 On September 3, 2002,1000 Virginia brought a breach of contract action against several of its subcontractors, including Vertecs, claiming that defective work led to the water intrusion and resulting damage to the apartment complex. A number of motions for summary judgment were subsequently filed, including a motion by Vertecs based on expiration of the statute of limitations. 1000 Virginia maintained, however, that the discovery rule applied under Architechtonics Construction Management, Inc. v. Khorram, 111 Wn. App. 725, 45 P.3d 1142 (2002), review denied, 148 Wn.2d 1005 (2003), where the Court of Appeals, Division One, adopted the discovery rule in a construction contract case. Ultimately, although the trial court held that the discovery rule applied, the action against Vertecs was dismissed on the basis that 1000 Virginia had conceded that a shorter limitations period applied under the parties\u2019 contract and this period had expired.\n\u00b64 The Court of Appeals reversed, first holding that 1000 Virginia did not concede application of the shorter contractual period and that in any event the contractual limitation period did not apply. Then the Court of Appeals held that the discovery rule applies and that material facts remain as to when 1000 Virginia knew or should have known its injury was connected to Vertecs\u2019 work. The court also rejected Vertecs\u2019 contention that RCW 4.16.326(l)(g) applies retroactively. This provision sets out an affirmative defense to a breach of construction contract claim, providing that the statute of limitations runs at the expiration of six years from the date of substantial completion or from the termination of services listed in RCW 4.16.300, whichever is later, regardless of discovery. The Court of Appeals declined to address Vertecs\u2019 claims that 1000 Virginia\u2019s action was barred by the equitable doctrines of waiver, estoppel, and laches on the ground that questions of fact precluded summary judgment based on these defenses. 1000 Virginia, 127 Wn. App. 899.\n\u00b65 In Lombardi v. JTE Construction, Inc., noted at 129 Wn. App. 1031, 2005 Wash. App. LEXIS 2424, Carl Lombardi contracted with JTE Construction, Inc., for construction of a residence. The house was substantially complete in August 1995. Thereafter, Lombardi noticed cracks in the siding and leaks in the roof requiring substantial repair work. JTE claims the defects were discovered in 1996, while Lombardi contends he discovered the defects in 1997 or 1998. On July 11, 2003, Lombardi filed suit against JTE, alleging breach of the parties\u2019 written construction contract. In August 2004, JTE moved for summary judgment of dismissal. The trial court granted the motion on the ground that RCW 4.16-.326(l)(g) applies retroactively and bars Lombardi\u2019s suit. The trial court denied JTE\u2019s motion for attorney fees pursuant to the parties\u2019 contract, which provides for attorney fees and costs to a prevailing party in a breach of contract action.\n\u00b66 The Court of Appeals reversed in an unpublished per curiam opinion, basing its decision on its opinions in 1000 Virginia and Architechtonics. The court declined to address Lombardi\u2019s claim for attorney fees pursuant to the parties\u2019 contract, leaving the question of attorney fees for the trial court pending the outcome of trial.\n\u00b67 The defendants\u2019 petitions for review were consolidated and granted. The Associated General Contractors of Washington, Dynasty Construction Company, and Ballard Square Condominium Owners Association have filed amici curiae briefs.\nANALYSIS\n\u00b68 In addressing whether a statute of limitations has run on an action arising out of construction or repair of an improvement on real property, both the relevant statute of limitations and the statute of repose set out in RCW 4.16.310 must be considered. RCW 4.16.310 is a six-year statute of repose that applies to actions arising out of the construction of a building. As this court has explained, statutes of repose are \u201cof a different nature than statutes of limitation.\u201dRice v. Dow Chem. Co., 124 Wn.2d 205, 211, 875 P.2d 1213 (1994). \u201cA statute of limitation bars plaintiff from bringing an already accrued claim after a specific period of time. A statute of repose terminates a right of action after a specified time, even if the injury has not yet occurred.\u201d Id. at 211-12 (citations omitted). Accordingly, this court has said, \u201cRCW 4.16.310 requires a 2-step analysis for computing the accrual of a cause of action arising from the construction, alteration, or repair of any improvement to real property. First, the cause of action must accrue within 6 years of substantial completion of the improvement; and second, a party then must file suit within the applicable statute of limitation, depending on the type of action.\u201d Del Guzzi Constr. Co. v. Global Nw. Ltd., 105 Wn.2d 878, 883, 719 P.2d 120 (1986).\n\u00b69 To illustrate the effect of the statute of repose, if, for example, a negligence claim against a contractor arising out of the construction of a building does not accrue until seven years after substantial completion, it is barred by RCW 4.16.310 because it did not accrue within the six-year period of the statute of repose. On the other hand, if the negligence action accrues five years after substantial completion of construction of a building, and therefore the claim is not barred by the statute of repose, the claim then must be brought within the limitations period for a negligence claim \u2014 generally within three years of accrual of the cause of action \u2014 and the action therefore would have to be brought before the end of eight years after substantial completion.\n\u00b610 Statutes of limitations do not begin to run until a cause of action accrues. RCW 4.16.005. Usually, a cause of action accrues when the party has the right to apply to a court for relief. Gazija v. Nicholas Jerns Co., 86 Wn.2d 215, 219, 543 P2d 338 (1975); Lybecker v. United Pac. Ins. Co., 67 Wn.2d 11, 15, 406 P.2d 945 (1965). In many instances an action accrues immediately when the wrongful act occurs, but in some circumstances where the plaintiff is unaware of harm sustained, a \u201cliteral application of the statute of limitations\u201d could \u201cresult in grave injustice.\u201d Gazija, 86 Wn.2d at 220. To avoid this injustice, courts have applied a discovery rule of accrual, under which the cause of action accrues when the plaintiff discovers, or in the reasonable exercise of diligence should discover, the elements of the cause of action. Green v. A.P.C., 136 Wn.2d 87, 95, 960 P.2d 912 (1998). This does not mean that the action accrues when the plaintiff learns that he or she has a legal cause of action; rather, the action accrues when the plaintiff discovers the salient facts underlying the elements of the cause of action. Id.\n\u00b611 In each of these cases, the plaintiffs brought suit under a discovery rule theory of accrual, in accord with the Court of Appeals decision in Architechtonics, 111 Wn. App. at 737, that \u201c[t]he statute of limitation for contract actions begins to run when a party knows or, in the exercise of due diligence should know, of the other party\u2019s breach.\u201d\n\u00b612 The defendant contractors, Vertecs and JTE, contend that the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in Architechtonics and application of the discovery rule in these two cases is erroneous in light of precedent from this court holding that accrual of a contract action occurs on breach of the contract. As the defendants maintain, this court has consistently held that accrual of a contract action occurs on breach. Schwindt v. Commonwealth Ins. Co., 140 Wn.2d 348, 353, 997 P.2d 353 (2000); Safeco Ins. Co. v. Barcom, 112 Wn.2d 575, 583, 773 P.2d 56 (1989); Taylor v. Puget Sound Power & Light Co., 64 Wn.2d 534, 537-38, 392 P.2d 802 (1964); McCoy v. Stevens, 182 Wash. 55, 58-60, 44 P.2d 797 (1935), overruled on other grounds by Samuelson v. Freeman, 75 Wn.2d 894, 901, 454 P.2d 406 (1969), and Ruth v. Dight, 75 Wn.2d 660, 453 P.2d 631 (1969), superseded by statute, RCW 4.16.350, as recognized in Winbun v. Moore, 143 Wn.2d 206, 214 n.3,18 P.3d 576 (2001); Cornell v. Edsen, 78 Wash. 662, 663-65, 139 P. 602 (1914), overruled on other grounds by Peters v. Simmons, 87 Wn.2d 400, 552 P.2d 1053 (1976).\n\u00b613 ha. Architechtonics, the Court of Appeals opined that this court had never considered when the statute of limitations begins to run in a contract action if reasonable diligence would not reveal the breach. Architechtonics, 111 Wn. App. at 730. The court noted that Washington courts had extended the discovery rule to a number of types of cases over the preceding 30 years and that the legislature had incorporated discovery rules into several statutes of limitations. Id. at 731-33. The Court of Appeals also said that this court had \u201cexpanded the discovery rule beyond tort cases,\u201d citing Stuart v. Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, Inc., 109 Wn.2d 406, 745 P.2d 1284 (1987), where the court applied the discovery rule in an action for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, and U.S. Oil & Refining Co. v. Department of Ecology, 96 Wn.2d 85, 633 P.2d 1329 (1981), where the court had applied the discovery rule in an action involving penalties for the illegal discharge of pollutants. Architechtonics, 111 Wn. App. at 733, 731.\n\u00b614 Additionally, the Court of Appeals addressed Taylor, which states that a contract cause of action accrues on breach and not on discovery. Taylor, 64 Wn.2d at 538 (quoting Cornell, 78 Wash. at 664). The Court of Appeals said that Taylor was decided five years before the discovery rule was adopted in Ruth, 75 Wn.2d 660 (a medical malpractice claim arising out of a sponge left in the plaintiff\u2019s body after surgery), and Ruth explicitly overruled Lindquist v. Mullen, 45 Wn.2d 675, 277 P.2d 724 (1954), on which the court relied in Taylor. Finally, the Court of Appeals characterized Taylor as involving unknown damages rather than unknown breach.\n\u00b615 The Court of Appeals\u2019 reasoning in Architechtonics is flawed in several respects. In a number of early breach of contract cases involving claims of professional malpractice, the plaintiffs tried to bring their claims as fraud claims because the statute of limitations for fraud claims included a statutory discovery rule. These claims were rejected on the basis that accrual of the action occurred at the time of breach of contract. See, e.g., Cornell, 78 Wash. at 665 (\u201clike any other action founded upon a breach of duty imposed either by law or contract, the action arises out of the breach, and the statute of limitations begins to run from the time of the breach and not from the time of its discovery \u201d (emphasis added)); accord McCoy, 182 Wash. at 58-60.\n\u00b616 The court\u2019s attempt to distinguish Taylor is also unpersuasive. In Taylor this court said that \u201cjr]unning of the statute of limitations against the breach of contract.. . is not postponed by the fact that the actual or substantial damages did not occur until a later date.\u201d Taylor, 64 Wn.2d at 538 (citing Lindquist, 45 Wn.2d 675). Thus, the Court of Appeals\u2019 characterization in Architechtonics of Taylor as involving unknown damages rather than an \u201cunknown breach\u201d is simply inaccurate. In Taylor, we clearly rejected a discovery rule approach to the contract action, just as this court had in earlier cases, adding that the fact that damages did not occur until later did not postpone running of the limitations period. Id.\n\u00b617 Finally, the fact that the court in Taylor cited Lindquist, which was subsequently overruled by Ruth, does not undercut the court\u2019s holding in Taylor that a contract action accrues on breach. When Ruth overruled Lindquist, it did so insofar as the statute of limitations \u201capplies to the type of medical malpractice claims arising out of the leaving of foreign bodies or substances in a surgical wound.\u201d Ruth, 75 Wn.2d at 667. Ruth did not touch on Lindquist\u2019s holding that contract actions accrue on breach.\n\u00b618 Because controlling precedent held that a claim arising out of a contract accrued on breach and not on discovery, the Court of Appeals lacked authority to adopt the discovery rule in Architechtonics. A decision by this court is binding on all lower courts in the state. Fondren v. Klickitat County, 79 Wn. App. 850, 856, 905 P.2d 928 (1995). When the Court of Appeals fails to follow directly controlling authority by this court, it errs. State v. Gore, 101 Wn.2d 481, 487, 681 P.2d 227 (1984). Thus, in adopting the discovery rule in Architechtonics and failing to follow controlling decisions of this court, the Court of Appeals erred.\n\u00b619 It follows that the Court of Appeals application of the discovery rule in the cases now before us was also erroneous. Nonetheless, application of the discovery rule in construction contract cases involving latent defects that the plaintiff would be unable to detect at the time of breach is a logical and desirable expansion of the discovery rule. We are persuaded that the rule should apply to contract claims involving latent construction defects.\n\u00b620 \u201cIn determining whether to apply the discovery rule, the possibility of stale claims must be balanced against the unfairness of precluding justified causes of action.\u201d U.S. Oil, 96 Wn.2d at 93; Gunnier v. Yakima Heart Ctr., Inc., 134 Wn.2d 854, 860, 953 P.2d 1162 (1998). A court must consider the goal of the common law \u201cto provide a remedy for every genuine wrong\u201d while recognizing, at the same time, that \u201ccompelling one to answer stale claims in the courts is in itself a substantial wrong.\u201d Ruth, 75 Wn.2d at 665.\n\u00b621 There is little to distinguish a case involving latent defects in a building and a case where a surgical instrument is left in the plaintiff\u2019s body during surgery. In both cases, the plaintiff may have no way of knowing that a cause of action exists, i.e., no way of knowing the facts that show that the construction contract was breached in the first case or that a duty of care was breached in the latter. Just as a patient may lack the ability to know that a surgical sponge has been left in place which causes serious harm, so too an unsuspecting homeowner may lack the ability to know that an inferior product was used, such as a type of siding, which results in significant damage. Cases in which courts have applied a discovery rule of accrual (either by statute or common law) include situations where structural defects in the plaintiffs\u2019 home were allegedly caused by improper site preparation and subsequent land settling, Boghossian v. Ferland Corp., 600 A.2d 288 (R.I. 1991); where roof trusses were installed that were inadequate to support the load, with resulting settling of a clerestory structure causing damage to roofing and posing a danger of collapse, McKinley v. Willow Constr. Co., 693 P.2d 1023 (Colo. Ct. App. 1984); where gas lines leaked and were unsafe, Matusik v. Dorn, 157 Ariz. 249, 756 P.2d 346 (Ct. App. 1988); where the contractor did not use corrosive resistant nails to install roofing, which began to fail nine years later with the result that shingles began falling off, Agustin v. Dan Ostrow Constr. Co., 64 Haw. 80, 636 P.2d 1348 (1981); and where plaintiffs alleged that improper felt underlayment and faulty roof design led to leaks in the roof, perimeter walls, and foundation, Black Bear Lodge v. Trillium Corp., 136 N.H. 635, 620 A.2d 428 (1993). In each of these cases, the defect was of a kind that the average homeowner would simply never know or have reason to know of the defect or that it would cause detectable damage years later.\n\u00b622 The court in Ehrenhaft v. Malcolm Price, Inc., 483 A.2d 1192 (D.C. 1984) reversed summary judgment in favor of the defendants, applying a discovery rule of accrual to the plaintiff-homeowner\u2019s multiple claims of faulty construction and design leading to damage. The court reasoned the discovery rule should apply because a person who has arranged for construction and design of his residence (there, an addition) \u201cmust undoubtedly rely upon the professional skills of those hired to perform the work. As a lay person, he is most likely without the requisite knowledge to determine whether the room has been properly designed or constructed.\u201d Id. at 1202. The court added that expecting such a person to hire \u201cyet another professional to oversee the work as it is performed\u201d is unreasonable. Id. These problems are exacerbated when the defect is latent. Id.\n\u00b623 Under such circumstances, it is unfair to permit a defendant to escape responsibility for shoddy construction simply because the cause of action is based on contract rather than a tort theory. In addition, it is more equitable to place the burden of loss on the party best able to prevent it, i.e., the contracting party who could avoid breaching the contract. Thus, the same fairness considerations weigh in favor of applying the discovery rule to construction contract actions where latent defects are alleged as weigh in favor of the rule in negligence actions.\n\u00b624 Of course, a plaintiff cannot ignore notice of possible defects. The discovery rule requires that \u201cwhen a plaintiff is placed on notice by some appreciable harm occasioned by another\u2019s wrongful conduct, the plaintiff must make further diligent inquiry to ascertain the scope of the actual harm. The plaintiff is charged with what a reasonable inquiry would have discovered.\u201d Green, 136 Wn.2d at 96. A person who has notice of facts that are sufficient to put him or her upon inquiry notice is deemed to have notice of all facts that reasonable inquiry would disclose. Id. (citing Hawkes v. Hoffman, 56 Wash. 120, 126, 105 P. 156 (1909)). Whether the plaintiff should have been able to detect defects (and presumably demand that they be remedied before the structure is accepted) involves a fact question that may be resolved against the plaintiff. Thus, if a plaintiff in a construction contract case inspects as construction proceeds, voluntarily or as a matter of contractual obligation, or is placed on inquiry notice of harm during construction, these facts will bear on whether the "

    "Ott, J. \u2014\nAugust 20, 1962, the American Building Maintenance Company, a corporation, was awarded a contract from the state of Washington for the performance of janitorial work at the Washington State Employment Security Building in Seattle.\nOctober 8, 1962, while this contract was in full force and effect, May Higgins slipped and fell as she entered the building. November 25, 1964, May Higgins and her husband commenced an action against the state of Washington for injuries she allegedly received resulting from the fall. She contended that the negligence of the state in allowing rainwater to accumulate on the floor inside of the entrance to the building was the sole and proximate cause of her injuries.\nThe state entered a general appearance and moved the court that the American Building Maintenance Company be made a third party defendant. The motion was granted and a third party complaint was served upon the defendant, American Building Maintenance Company. The third party complaint alleged that the company had breached its contract with the state in failing to keep the entranceway clean. The third party defendant\u2019s motion for a dismissal of the complaint was granted on the ground that the complaint did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted. From a judgment dismissing its claim against the third party defendant, the state has appealed.\nThe third party complaint, in addition to pleading the facts substantially as set forth above, alleged that the third party defendant was an independent contractor; that the third party defendant had agreed to keep the premises clean, particularly the entranceways; and that if the entranceways had become wet and slippery creating a hazardous condition, as alleged by May Higgins, the hazardous condition was a result of the third party defendant\u2019s failure to perform the provisions of the contract. Paragraph 5 states as follows:\nThat under the terms of said contract, special provisions and standard specifications, referred to in Paragraph IV above, the third-party defendant, American Building Maintenance Company, is liable to the State of Washington for any sum or judgment based on damages so entered and paid by the State of Washington.\nAttached to the third party complaint was a copy of the Invitation to Bid, Specifications and Special Provisions, the Bid and the Award. The Specifications and Special Provisions provided, inter alia, \u201cBidders to contact the local office manager to discuss with him the standards of performance that shall be expected.\u201d (Italics ours.) The contract further provided that \u201c. . . the Invitation to Bid, the Special Provisions, . . . and the Award, shall constitute the contract. . . .\u201d\nRule of Pleading, Practice and Procedure 12(b), RCW vol. 0, provides: \u201c . . . the following defenses may at the option of the pleader be made by motion: . . . (6) . . . failure ... to state a claim upon which relief can be granted . . . .\u201d\nRule of Pleading, Practice and Procedure 8(a) provides:\n(a) Claims for Relief. A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief, whether an original claim, counter-claim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall contain (1) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief, and (2) a demand for judgment for the relief to which he deems himself entitled. Relief in the alternative or of several different types may be demanded.\nA complaint can be dismissed under the provisions of RPPP 12(b) for failure to state a claim only where it is clear beyond doubt from a reading of the complaint that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. Sherwood v. Moxee School Dist. No. 90, 58 Wn.2d 351, 363 P.2d 138 (1961), and cases cited.\nFor the purposes of a motion to dismiss a complaint for failing to state a claim, the factual allegations of the complaint must be accepted as true. In the instant case, the third party complaint alleged (1) a contract, (2) a breach thereof, and (3) in the event liability attached to the state, a judgment over against the third party defendant. Such pleadings alleged a \u201cset of facts\u201d which support a claim for relief.\nApplying the rules set forth above, we hold that the third party complaint does state facts sufficient to support a claim against the third party defendant.\nThe cause is reversed with instructions to reinstate the third party complaint and to proceed in accordance with the views herein expressed. Costs will abide the final determination of the cause.\nDonworth, Weaver, and Rosellini, JJ., and Langenbach, J. Pro Tern., concur.\nMarch 6, 1967. Petition for rehearing denied."

    -6.459036350250244,
    "Rosellini, J.\nThe respondent, Florence Frisken, is the owner of a building in Shelton, Washington, occupied by her tenant, Mell Chevrolet Company. On November 20, 1952, she entered into an agreement with the appellant, a corporation engaged in the business of selling and laying floor coverings, whereby the latter contracted to furnish and install grease-proof asphalt-tile flooring in the showroom and office of the respondent\u2019s building.\nPrior to the submission of the appellant\u2019s bid, its president, Arthur E. Strand, examined the floors of the showroom and office, which were of concrete covered with magnesite, and recommended a tile which would meet the respondent\u2019s needs. The appellant\u2019s bid was accepted, and by December 3, 1952, the installation was completed.\nWithin a week or ten days after the flooring was laid, it was observed that a dark sticky substance was oozing up between the tiles. On the strength of the appellant\u2019s assurance that the condition was temporary and would disappear in a few weeks, the respondent paid for the flooring.\nWhen the oozing or sloughing continued after six weeks had elapsed, complaint was made again, but it appears that nothing was done to correct the condition. Eventually the magnesite beneath the tile grew spongy and caused the floor to rise in spots, resulting in an uneven surface and cracks in the tile. Agents of the appellant inspected the floor and reported that the magnesite was crumbling and falling apart. Still nothing was done to repair or remedy the condition, and after it had continued for more than a year, this action was commenced to recover upon an alleged breach of an implied warranty of fitness.\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a judgment in favor of the respondent.\nWhile the appellant admits that the flooring is not satisfactory for the purpose for which it was intended, it contends that (1) the defects were caused by factors beyond its control, and that the implied warranty of fitness does not cover such defects, or (2) if there was a breach of warranty, the defect was waived when the respondent paid for the installation.\nThe defense of waiver was not pleaded, and the appellant did not request a finding that the respondent had waived the defect. As we have often said, this court will not consider a theory which was not passed upon by the trial court and is presented for the first time on appeal. Muck v. Snohomish County Public Utility Dist., 41 Wn. (2d) 81, 247 P. (2d) 233 (1952); Smith v. King County, 28 Wn. (2d) 917, 184P. (2d) 562 (1947).\nThe facts as found by the trial court do not establish a waiver, since payment was made after the appellant had given its assurance that the sloughing would disappear, a fact which negatives any implication of an intent to waive the defect. Furthermore, the full extent of the damage did not appear until several months after payment was made. The fact that the respondent had paid for the flooring would not deprive her of her right to recover for a breach of which she neither knew nor had reason to know at the time. See Eliason v. Walker, 42 Wn. (2d) 473, 256 P. (2d) 298 (1953), a case in which the plaintiffs, purchasers of a heating system, elected to rescind the contract after the equipment had been paid for and had been in operation for three months. We held that the delay did not constitute a waiver of their right to rescind for breach of warranty, since the inadequacy of the heating system was not established until it had been in operation for some time.\nWe turn now to the appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in finding a breach of warranty. According to the findings, the respondent advised the appellant that an attractive floor was needed because the room was to be used for display purposes; she relied upon the skill and judgment of the appellant\u2019s agent, who represented to her that the appellant could and would install a floor which would satisfy her needs. The floor, the trial court found, was entirely unsatisfactory. It concluded that there had been a breach of the implied warranty of fitness imposed under Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 5836-15 [cf. RCW 63.04.160], which provides in part as follows:\n\u201c (1) Where the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required, and it appears that the buyer relies on the seller\u2019s skill or judgment (whether he be the grower or manufacturer or not), there is an implied warranty that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose.\u201d\nThe appellant argues that there was no competent evidence that the unsatisfactory condition was caused by faulty installation, and it is the custom of contractors not to warrant that magnesite flooring will not deteriorate and damage tile which is laid over it; therefore, there could be no implied warranty of fitness. In regard to the latter contention, there was scant evidence of such a general custom; the trial court made no finding that a custom existed, and none was requested. This facet of the argument is consequently without merit.\nThe respondent\u2019s expert witness, to whose qualifications the appellant made no objection, testified that the sloughing and unevenness was caused by moisture coming up through the magnesite, and that the \u201csweating\u201d could have been avoided by the use of a sealer. The appellant\u2019s expert witnesses testified that there is no sealer which can prevent this sweating, and that it occurs where no barrier has been erected beneath the magnesite or concrete; that there is nothing which can be done to prevent the occurrence once the magnesite and concrete have been improperly laid. The record contains no finding on this precise point, and apparently the trial court did not consider it controlling. Assuming that the fact was established, this in itself does not relieve the appellant of liability.\nWhile the appellant\u2019s president testified that he did not and could not have anticipated the condition which developed, he stated that the magnesite was tested for moisture before the tile was laid. The inescapable inference is that he knew of the possibility that moisture would rise through the magnesite and damage the tile. Furthermore, another of appellant\u2019s witnesses, also a flooring contractor, testified that, unless a water barrier is installed, magnesite has a tendency to sweat and cause discoloration of the tile, and that it is customary to warn the purchaser of this possibility. In this instance, no inquiry was made to ascertain whether a water barrier had been installed, and the respondent was not advised of the risk involved.\nNo error is assigned to the court\u2019s finding that the appellant was familiar with climatic conditions in the area and knew the location of the floor with reference to the ground level as well as the nature and composition of the subflooring. Knowing or being charged with knowledge that there was a risk involved, of which respondent was obviously ignorant, and having failed to warn her of this risk before she made her investment, the appellant must be held to have warranted that the floor would be fit for the intended use regardless of the structure of the underflooring. It is the respondent\u2019s ignorance of the nature and characteristics of floorings which establishes her reliance on the appellant\u2019s skill and judgment. Had the deterioration of the tile resulted from some latent defect in the underflooring which the appellant could not have anticipated, or which the respondent as well as the appellant might have anticipated, a different question would be presented.\nThe view we take is in accord with our holding in Columbia Concrete Pipe Co. v. Knowles, 36 Wn. (2d) 602, 219 P. (2d) 557 (1950). The defendant in that case, a farmer in eastern Washington, had contracted with the plaintiff for the purchase and installation of a pipe line which would irrigate certain designated portions of his farm. It was agreed that the defendant would dig the ditch for the pipe line, which he proceeded to do. The plaintiff\u2019s agents, knowing that the ditch was probably too shallow, nevertheless laid the pipe, which soon sprang a number of leaks and proved to be unsatisfactory. Had the pipe been laid at the proper depth, it appeared that the leaks would not have occurred. We held that subdivision (1) of Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 5836-15, was applicable, and that the defendant, having made known to the plaintiff the purpose for which the pipe line was to be used and having relied upon the plaintiff\u2019s skill and judgment, was entitled to recover on his cross-complaint for a breach of an implied warranty of fitness.\nAs we said in Lundquist v. Coca Cola Bottling, Inc., 42 Wn. (2d) 170, 254 P. (2d) 488 (1953), it is not necessary to prove negligence in order to recover for a breach of an implied warranty. The plaintiff must allege and prove: first, that he made known to the seller, either expressly or by implication, the particular purpose for which the article was required, and second, that it appeared that he relied upon the seller\u2019s skill and judgment when he purchased the article. Under the rule of Columbia Concrete Pipe Co. v. Knowles, supra, if the seller undertakes to install the purchased item, he impliedly warrants that, after installation, it will be fit for the use intended. Of course, the seller may disclaim such a warranty, or the circumstances may negative reliance; but there is no evidence of a disclaimer here, and there is no question but that the respondent relied upon the appellant\u2019s superior skill and judgment, and that the appellant was made aware of this fact.\nAs we have construed the statute, the facts of this case fall within its provisions.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nHamley, C. J., Mallery, Hill, and Weaver, JJ., concur."

    "\u00b61\nC. Johnson, J.\nThis case involves a challenge to a housing regulation prohibiting the posting of signs on the exterior of resident apartment doors. The superior court granted summary judgment to Resident Action Council (RAC), enjoining enforcement of the regulation. The superior court held that the regulation violated residents\u2019 free speech rights under the United States and Washington Constitutions. Seattle Housing Authority (SHA) appealed and we accepted certification. We affirm.\nFACTS\n\u00b62 SHA is a public housing authority, organized under the state Housing Authorities Law (ch. 35.82 RCW). Among the low-income housing programs it operates is the low-income public housing (LIPH) program, which is funded in part by the federal government. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 160. There are roughly 5,300 LIPH units in Seattle.\n\u00b63 Tenancies in LIPH facilities are governed by lease agreements. SHA issues \u201chouse rules\u201d which tenants must sign and are incorporated by reference into their leases. CP at 207. Residents have obligations, set out in the house rules, to maintain the interior and exterior appearance of the buildings in which they reside. For example, SHA restricts the installation of locks on unit doors and restricts the use of certain adhesives and the weight of items residents can hang on unit interior walls. CP at 202, 204. Rule violations are treated as violations of the lease. The lease agreement does not specifically state whether residents\u2019 doors are included in the property leased to residents or not. Br. of SHA at 12.\n\u00b64 SHA considered issuing a rule limiting the amount and type of material that could be posted on unit doors. CP at 172-75. The record indicates that residents'have posted \u201csigns,\u201d including artistic images, flags, and political messages. CP at 210-16. -SHA claims that swastikas and nude images have appeared on residents\u2019 doors. SHA rejected the idea of a limited regulation as likely ineffective in reducing SHA\u2019s management burden and costs and resident disagreements. Br. of SHA at 9-10.\n\u00b65 Instead, SHA issued house rule number 42 (the rule), at issue in this case. The rule bans all signs, flyers, placards, advertisements, \u201cor similar material\u201d from exterior walls, interior common area walls and doors, and the surface of unit doors that face the hall or outside. CP at 162. The rule does not address the posting of materials inside resident units, and it permits postings in designated areas with prior written approval.\n\u00b66 The rule refers to SHA\u2019s desire that its buildings be indistinguishable from other neighborhood buildings. The rule states that indiscriminate posting created \u201ca negative appearance which detrimentally affects residents of the building, residents of the surrounding community, and the public generally.\u201d In its briefing, SHA expands on this explanation, stating that some displays had been creating hostility among residents, which SHA managers were called upon to mediate. It also claims that it incurs significant costs in refinishing doors damaged by postings. Br. of SHA at 9.\nf 7 The RAC, a nonprofit organization composed of elected tenant representatives from LIPH communities, sued after SHA refused to withdraw or modify the rule. RA.C claimed that the rule violated residents\u2019 rights of free speech guaranteed by the United States and Washington Constitutions. CP at 1-12. RAC moved for summary judgment, seeking an order declaring the rule unconstitutional and enjoining SHA from enforcing it. CP at 139.\n\u00b68 The superior court found that the signs and materials posted on exterior surfaces of residential doors are \u201cresidential signs\u201d and hence constitutionally-protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and entitled to heightened judicial scrutiny, applying the reasoning of City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. 43, 114 S. Ct. 2038, 129 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1994). The superior court found that residents could, but did not, cede their control over exterior surfaces of unit doors to SHA or designate those surfaces as \u201ccommon areas.\u201d Finally, the superior court held that the SHA\u2019s cited interests were not sufficiently compelling to justify the regulation. The superior court permanently enjoined SHA from enforcing the rule in any way that infringed on tenants\u2019 rights to use their doors for expressive purposes. CP at 222-25. We accepted certification from the Court of Appeals.\nANALYSIS\n\u00b69 The superior court found for RAC on RAC\u2019s motion for summary judgment and enjoined enforcement of the rule. We review issues of law involving a constitutional challenge de novo, and the State bears the burden of justifying a restriction on speech. Ino Ino, Inc. v. City of Bellevue, 132 Wn.2d 103, 114, 937 P.2d 154, 943 P.2d 1358 (1997).\n\u00b610 The first issue we need to decide is, under the facts of this case, who has \u201ccontrol\u201d or \u201cownership\u201d of the exterior of the door. This determination is critical to deciding what analysis to apply. If SHA retains \u201cownership\u201d of the door, SHA argues this would mean that a nonpublic forum analysis would apply, under which limitations on expressive conduct are reviewed more leniently. RAC argues that the doors are included in the leased premises and, as such, become the property of the tenant during the term of the lease. Under its argument, a government ban on all residential signs constitutes a violation of the First Amendment.\n\u00b611 Generally, a lease is a conveyance of a limited estate for a limited term with conditions attached. Under Washington law, as a general rule, areas that are necessary to a tenant\u2019s use of the premises, and are for the exclusive use of the tenant and tenant\u2019s invitees, pass as an appurtenant to the leased premises though not specifically mentioned or described therein. Andrews v. McCutcheon, 17 Wn.2d 340, 344-45, 135 P.2d 459 (1943).\n\u00b612 The issue in McCutcheon was whether McCutcheon, the landlord, had a duty to maintain a stairway. Patrons of the salon above McCutcheon\u2019s store had to walk through McCutcheon\u2019s store and then use an outside stairway at the store\u2019s rear to reach the salon. A salon patron, Andrews, was injured descending the stairway. McCutcheon argued that he had no duty to maintain the stairs. He contended that when he leased the balcony above his store, the stairway also passed as an appurtenant thereto.\n\u00b613 The court stated that a basic right of ingress and egress through McCutcheon\u2019s store would assumptively be covered by the lease. The salon owner\u2019s exclusive use of the stairway, in contrast, entailed a greater right of control than that resulting from the tenants\u2019 and customers\u2019 need to pass through the store:\nIt is a general rule of law that, when premises are leased, a stairway necessary to be used with them, and which is intended shall be for the exclusive use of the tenant and his invitees, passes as an appurtenant to the leased premises and is covered by the lease, though not specifically mentioned or described therein; but, when premises are leased to several tenants and it is necessary, in the enjoyment thereof, that they use a common stairway and no mention is made of it when the lease is made, it is not deemed to be appurtenant to the leased premises and covered by the lease, but the tenants and their invitees have the right to use the same as a means of access to the leased property.\nMcCutcheon, 17 Wn.2d at 344-45. Under this rule, because the stairway was used exclusively by the tenant and his invitees, the salon owner would receive more than a mere right to use the stairway for access.\n\u00b614 McCutcheon involved control over a stairway, but its reasoning applies with equal force here. A tenant\u2019s authority over his or her unit door is greater than that necessary for mere ingress or egress. When a door is necessary to a tenant\u2019s use of the premises, and is for the exclusive use of the tenant and the tenant\u2019s invitees, it passes as an appurtenant to the leased premises and is part of the leased premises. Put simply, the door that opens to the tenancy passes to the tenant unless the lease provides otherwise.\nf 15 This same reasoning would apply if the leased premises involved a single family residence. The general rule is that the tenant receives the right to possess and use the house, the yard, and everything else necessary to the use of the leased premises. An apartment lease operates on the same principle as does a lease of a single family residence.\n\u00b616 SHA argues that the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d stated in McCutcheon should not apply here because SHA retained control over the doors. In McCutcheon the plaintiff argued that McCutcheon was liable, notwithstanding the general rule, because through McCutcheon\u2019s actions he expressly and impliedly indicated intent to retain control over the stairway. The court agreed; rather than passing as appurtenant to the leased premises, the court found that Mc-Cutcheon retained ownership and control over the stairs.\n\u00b617 The facts here do not establish a reservation of control. Unlike SHA hallways and other such common areas, other tenants and the general public have no right of access to the outer surface of unit doors. Cf. de la O v. Hous. Auth., 417 F.3d 495 (5th Cir. 2005) (finding the common areas of public housing facilities are public property and nonpublic forums). Nor does a landlord\u2019s control over a hallway, in itself, signal the landlord\u2019s intent to reserve control over an adjoining surface that is not common. It is not significant to this inquiry that the door, when closed, serves as part of the hallway. To the extent that a resident\u2019s use of his or her door does not interfere with use of the common area, the landlord\u2019s control over the common area does not imply a reservation of control over the adjacent door.\n\u00b618 Nor would SHA impliedly retain control despite its responsibility for repair and replacement and liability for defective doors. Br. of SHA at 13-14. SHA has a duty to maintain doors under the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973 and local codes. See RCW 59.18.060; Seattle Municipal Code 22.206.120, .140. SHA has a duty to maintain that is a function of statutory responsibilities, so maintenance is not tantamount to asserting a right of control. For these reasons, we find that SHA residents have, and retained, control and dominion over the outer surfaces of their doors.\n\u00b619 In light of tenant control over their respective unit doors, RAC argues that Gilleo is directly on point. We agree with the tenants that the analysis in Gilleo controls the issue presented here.\n\u00b620 In Gilleo, Margaret Gilleo sued the city of Ladue, alleging that Ladue\u2019s sign ordinance violated her First Amendment rights. That ordinance barred Ladue residents, like Gilleo, from erecting a wide variety of signs on their property \u201c \u2018wherever placed out of doors in view of the general public or ... as a window sign.\u2019 \u201d 512 U.S. at 46 n.5 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert, at 39a). The ordinance exempted, among others, for sale signs and on-site commercial and organizational signs.\n\u00b621 The United States Supreme Court stated that a prohibition is not always invalid merely because it applies to a sizeable category of speech. For example, a ban on signs on public property poses a lesser threat to the ability to communicate effectively because the category of speech banned is not a uniquely valuable or important mode of communication. In contrast, residential signs are a means of communication that is \u201cvenerable . . . unique and important.\u201d 512 U.S. at 54. Residential signs \u201creflect and animate change in the life of a community.\u201d 512 U.S. at 54.\n\u00b622 The Court cited unique facets of this medium. The medium is inexpensive and convenient. Residential signs reach neighbors, an audience \u201cthat could not be reached nearly as well by other means.\u201d 512 U.S. at 57. Further, residential signs have great value derived from their clear association with an identified speaker. \u201cDisplaying a sign from one\u2019s own residence often carries a message quite distinct from placing the same sign someplace else____\u201d512 U.S. at 56. In addition, the Court referred to the special respect for individual liberty in the home, a \u201cprinciple [that] has special resonance when the government seeks to constrain a person\u2019s ability to speak there.\u201d 512 U.S. at 58. In response to the argument that the ordinance was merely a time, place, or manner restriction, the Court again emphasized the unique medium in question. It said it was not persuaded that adequate substitutes exist. The Court concluded that the provision prohibited \u201ctoo much\u201d speech. 512 U.S. at 50-51.\n\u00b623 Like the ordinance in Gilleo, the SHA rule bans too much speech. The signs in this case may reflect reactions to local events or signal support or opposition to political candidates or laws. They do so in a manner that is inexpensive. Of particular importance here, the signs are unique because \u201c[d]isplaying a sign from one\u2019s own residence carries a message quite distinct from placing the same sign someplace else\u201d or by other means. 512 U.S. at 56. The identity of the resident is an \u201cimportant component\u201d of this means of communication. 512 U.S. at 56.\n\u00b624 SHA has failed to meet its burden of justifying a restriction on speech. In reaching this conclusion, we consider first SHA\u2019s asserted interest in avoiding the cost of refinishing doors damaged by residents\u2019 signs. CP at 199. SHA already restricts the installation of locks on unit doors and limits the weight of items residents can hang on interior walls. CP at 202, 204. SHA could impose restrictions that would prevent damage to its doors by requiring the use of nondamaging materials. A total ban on signs is unnecessary to support the claimed interest.\n\u00b625 Regarding SHA\u2019s asserted interest in reducing clutter, \u201cwhile aesthetic interests are legitimate goals, they require careful scrutiny when weighed against free speech interests because their subjective nature creates a high risk of impermissible speech restrictions.\u201d Collier v. City of Tacoma, 121 Wn.2d 737, 752, 854 P.2d 1046 (1993) (finding Tacoma\u2019s interests in aesthetics and traffic safety sufficient to justify reasonable content-neutral regulation of noncommunicative aspects like size and spacing).\n\u00b626 Aesthetic concerns may merit some type of regulation here. SHA residents do not own their living spaces, and some residents may act based on what they feel is a reduced incentive to maintain property values. Cf. Gilleo, 512 U.S. at 58 (Ladue residents had a strong incentive to keep their own property values up and to prevent visual clutter, \u201cincentives markedly different from those of persons who erect signs on others\u2019 land.\u201d). However, \u201cmore temperate measures,\u201d Gilleo, 512 U.S. at 58, are available to SHA in addressing this interest, including some limit on noncommunicative aspects of the signs. The same is true of SHA\u2019s interest in avoiding conflict between residents. While a ban is an inexpensive solution, other measures could achieve this interest without foreclosing the medium altogether. We find that SHA has not met its burden of justifying the restriction on speech.\n\u00b627 An obvious purpose of the unit doors is to permit egress and ingress. However, that purpose is neither incompatible with expressive activity nor the sole purpose of this property. LIPH buildings provide a community for SHA residents, with all that that entails. Here, each unit door passed as appurtenant to the leased premises. In the eyes and minds of tenants and the public, the outer surface of the door represents the outer boundary of the tenants\u2019 homes. A ban on signs placed there is subject to the same scrutiny applied to the ordinance in Gilleo. Cf. Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 408, 94 S. Ct. 2727, 41 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1974) (statute forbidding the attachment of symbols to United States flag unconstitutional as applied; among \u201cimportant\u201d factors was that display occurred on private property).\n\u00b628 It does not matter that SHA tenants lease and do not own the unit. Gilleo makes no distinctions between privately-owned residences and publicly-owned surfaces leased as part of a residence to a private tenant. A sign placed on a unit door by the resident under these circumstances is a residential sign. We find Gilleo\u2019s analysis persuasive and conclude that the rule violates the First Amendment rights of LIPH tenants. We affirm the decision of the trial court.\nAlexander, C.J.; Sanders and Owens, JJ.; and Bridgewater, J. Pro Tem., concur.\nUnder article I, section 5 of the Washington Constitution, \u201c[e]very person may freely speak, write and publish on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that right.\u201d Under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, \u201cCongress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\u201d Neither party makes independent arguments based on the state constitution."

    "Chambers, J.\n\u00b61 In 1998, this court held that under then-existing law, new private water rights did not fully vest until the water was put to a beneficial use, and not merely when the \u201c \u2018pumps and pipes\u2019 \u201d capacity to use the water was built. Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Theodoratus, 135 Wn.2d 582, 586, 957 P.2d 1241 (1998). We cautioned then that we were not considering municipal water rights, which often receive separate treatment in water law. Id. at 594. In response to our opinion, the legislature amended the municipal water law, Second Engrossed Second Substitute H.B. 1338, 58th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 2003) (SESSHB 1338), to, among other things, explicitly define certain nongovernmental water suppliers as municipal and to make that definition retroactive. We are now asked whether these amendments violate separation of powers or facially violate due process. We conclude they do not. We reverse in part and affirm in part.\nBACKGROUND\n\u00b62 The beneficial and wise use of water has been a public concern since before we achieved statehood. Code of 1881, ch. 191, at 434; Ellis v. Pomeroy Improvement Co., 1 Wash. 572, 577-78, 21 P. 27 (1889) (discussing territorial water law). By 1891, our legislature was regulating water, Laws of 1891, ch. 142, at 327, and by 1917, our legislature had declared that\nsubject to existing rights all waters within the state belong to the public, and any right thereto, or to the use thereof, shall be hereafter acquired only by appropriation for a beneficial use and in the manner provided and not otherwise; and, as between appropriations, the first in time shall be the first in right.\nLaws of 1917, ch. 117, \u00a7 1 (currently codified as RCW 90.03.010). The beneficial use of waters is a priority in our state; our state constitution itself specifically provides that \u201c[t]he use of the waters of this state for irrigation, mining and manufacturing purposes shall be deemed a public use.\u201d Wash. Const, art. XXI, \u00a7 1. In partial implementation of that principle, water rights can be lost if they are not used, in whole or in part, for five or more years. RCW 90.14.160-.180. Water rights can also be lost if they are abandoned. Okanogan Wilderness League, Inc. v. Town of Twisp, 133 Wn.2d 769, 781, 947 P.2d 732 (1997). However, municipal water supply rights (among many others) are not subject to relinquishment. RCW 90.14.140(2)(d).\n\u00b63 Like most Western states, Washington regulates \u201cthe acquisition of appropriative rights to the use of public waters and ... the distribution of water to those entitled to receive it.\u201d 1 Wells A. Hutchins, Water Rights Laws in the Nineteen Western States 7 (1971). Generally speaking, there is no private right to own the waters that flow across Washington State. Rigney v. Tacoma Light & Water Co., 9 Wash. 576, 583, 38 P. 147 (1894). Instead, a private right to use water can be acquired, and water can be owned once it is diverted for that use. Geddis v. Parrish, 1 Wash. 587, 590-91, 21 P. 314 (1889) (citing Lower Kings River Water Ditch Co. v. Kings River & Fresno Canal Co., 60 Cal. 408 (1882)); Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, 118 Wn.2d 761, 767, 827 P.2d 275 (1992) (citing Madison v. McNeal, 171 Wash. 669, 674, 19 P.2d 97 (1933)). As a learned treatise summarizes it:\nThe appropriative right does not extend to ownership of the corpus of water while it remains in the natural source of supply. It is a right to the use of the water \u2014 a usufruct. Inherent in the right of appropriation are the requirements that the use made of the appropriated water shall be a beneficial one, and that the right to divert and use the water extends only to the quantity actually applied to such beneficial use. The appropriative right, therefore, is not merely a right to the use of the water; it is a right of beneficial use. This is the view that the courts have taken through the years, probably without significant dissent.\n1 Hutchins, supra, at 440.\n\u00b64 While the details have changed over the years, generally, our regulatory scheme has sought to balance vigorous beneficial use of the State\u2019s waters without impairing existing uses. To that end, Washington has a multistep procedure before new water rights can be acquired. While the details will vary depending on whether the applicant seeks to appropriate surface water or groundwater, among other things, the would-be user first submits an application to the Department of Ecology. RCW 90.03.250; see also ch. 90.44 RCW (groundwater). The department may give the applicant a temporary permit to use water while the application is being evaluated. RCW 90.03.250; see also RCW 90.03.260, .290. Second, once the application is complete, the department directs the applicant to publish notice in a paper of general circulation. RCW 90.03.280. Meanwhile, the department determines \u201cwhat water, if any, is available ... and find[s] and determine^] to what beneficial use or uses it can be applied.\u201d RCW 90.03.290(1). Fourth, if the department is satisfied that water is available and the proposed use is a beneficial use, it issues a permit specifying the amounts of water that can be taken and the beneficial uses to which that water may be applied. RCW 90.03-.290(3). A water right permit represents only an inchoate right, which does not become choate until the water right is perfected. RCW 90.03.330; Theodoratus, 135 Wn.2d at 589-90; Ellis, 1 Wash, at 577. Before the right is perfected, the applicant has only\n\u201can incomplete appropriative right in good standing. It comes into being as the first step provided by law for acquiring an appropriative right is taken. It remains in good standing so long as the requirements of law are being fulfilled. And it matures into an appropriative right on completion of the last step provided by law.\u201d\nTheodoratus, 135 Wn.2d at 596 (quoting 1 Hutchins, supra, at 226). Permits can be extended for good cause shown, and permits can be canceled if their terms are violated. RCW 90.03.320. Water rights can also be obtained by condemnation. RCW 90.03.040.\n\u00b65 Once the water right is perfected, a water right certificate is issued. RCW 90.03.330. This certificate relates back to the time of application, so long as the rights were perfected with reasonable diligence. RCW 90.03.340; Avery v. Johnson, 59 Wash. 332, 335, 109 P. 1028 (1910). Given that the rights of junior water rights holders are subordinate to earlier rights holders, RCW 90.03.010, and given that water is an increasingly scarce resource, that relation back has significant value. Once rights are perfected, the point of diversion, the use, and the ownership of those rights may be changed or transferred, though only to the extent the water right has been historically put to beneficial use and other rights holders are not harmed. RCW 90.03.380(1); Okanogan Wilderness, 133 Wn.2d at 777-78; see also R.D. Merrill Co. v. Pollution Control Hearings Bd., 137 Wn.2d 118, 128-29, 969 P.2d 458 (1999); 1 Hutchins, supra, at 633-34 (noting that with some exceptions, place of use may not be changed without administrative consent). At the time of Theodoratus, disputes about water rights were first taken to the Pollution Control Hearings Board (PCHB). E.g., Theodoratus, 135 Wn.2d at 589; see also former RCW 43.21B.110 (1998). After Theodoratus, the legislature directed that water rights claimants file a petition with the Department of Ecology that could be referred directly to the superior court or proceed under the Administrative Procedure Act. Ch. 34.05 RCW; RCW 90.03.110; see also 23 Timothy Butler & Matthew King, Washington Practice: Environmental Law and Practice \u00a7 8.50, at 335 (2007). At oral argument, counsel for the State also suggested that other rights holders harmed by changes had a tort remedy.\n\u00b66 Until recently, it was not entirely clear what it took to perfect a water right. Early case law indicates that rights were not perfected until the water was both appropriated and put to beneficial use. See, e.g., Ortel v. Stone, 119 Wash. 500, 503, 205 P. 1055 (1922) (\u201cThe measure of their rights by appropriation is the amount of water which they have actually taken and put to a beneficial use.\u201d). However, at least since the 1950s, it seems the Department of Ecology and its predecessor were willing to issue permits and certificates based upon need and capacity rather than the actual beneficial use of the water. Theodoratus, 135 Wn.2d at 587. The approach of establishing water rights upon the capacity of the system enjoys the descriptive term of art \u201cpumps and pipes.\u201d Uneasiness developed among Washington\u2019s water users as different administrations of the Department of Ecology dealt differently with application of the statutory term \u201cbeneficial use.\u201d The tension between the application of the \u201cbeneficial use\u201d and the \u201cpumps and pipes\u201d capacity standards came to a head with this court\u2019s decision in Theodoratus, 135 Wn.2d 582.\n\u00b67 George Theodoratus was a developer whose development progressed slowly over decades, apparently struggling to overcome litigation and economic downturns during the 1970s and 1980s. Id. at 587-88. Theodoratus received several extensions of the water permit for his development. Id. The last extension included the condition that his vested water rights would be based upon the actual water put to beneficial use rather than the development\u2019s water system\u2019s capacity. Id. at 588. Theodoratus appealed the actual beneficial use condition, perhaps because he had platted 253 lots, built a water system for 93 houses, and built 28 houses, none of which were, as far as we know, actually receiving water. Id. at 587,608 (Sanders, J., dissenting). We examined the current statutes in light of common law and recent court decisions. We concluded that the statutory scheme codified fundamental Western water law and required that actual beneficial use must occur before a water right certificate may issue. Id. at 592, 595. In short, we concluded that the Department of Ecology had not been following the statute when it vested water rights based upon system capacity instead of actual beneficial use of water. We cautioned, however, that we were not considering \u201cissues concerning municipal water suppliers\u201d and noted that \u201cthe statutory scheme allows for differences between municipal and other water use.\u201d Id. at 594. At that time, \u201cmunicipal water supply\u201d was not defined in chapter 90.03 RCW and the State acknowledges that there were no promulgated rules or policy guides defining \u201cmunicipal water supply purposes\u201d prior to the 2003 amendments. Opening Br. of Appellant/Cross-Resp\u2019t State of Wash, at 40. On occasion, private water supply companies were deemed municipal, but the department also took the position that private water associations were not entitled to be treated as municipal water suppliers. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 825-31 (Ga. Manor Water Ass\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t of Ecology, Wash. Pollution Control Hrg\u2019s Bd. No. 93-68 (Order Granting Partial Summ. J. (Nov. 9, 1994))).\n\u00b68 Our Theodoratus decision caused concern among existing water users about the vitality of their existing water rights based on capacity. Apparently some water users were further unnerved by a draft policy floated by the Department of Ecology, but never adopted, which would have required all water rights based upon capacity to comply with the actual beneficial use requirement. The legislature responded to these uncertainties in 2003 by significantly amending the water law act. See Laws of 2003, 1st Spec. Sess., ch 5; SESSHB 1338. Among other things, the 2003 amendments defined \u201cmunicipal water supplier\u201d and \u201cmunicipal water supply purposes\u201d for the first time, defined when \u201cplace of use\u201d could be the same as a municipal water supplier\u2019s service area, established that municipal water rights were not limited to the number of subscribers, and required specific conservation practices and planning. See Laws of 2003, 1st Spec. Sess., ch 5; SESSHB 1338; see also H.B. Rep. on Second Engrossed Second Substitute H.B. 1338, at 1-2, 58th Leg., 1st Spec. Sess. (Wash. 2003) (listing purposes of enacted bill). The bill also declared that \u201cwater right certificate [s] issued prior to September 9, 2003 for municipal water supply purposes as defined in RCW 90.03.015\u201d based on system capacity were rights in good standing. Laws op 2003,1st Spec. Sess., ch. 5, \u00a7 6(3) (codified as RCW 90.03.330(3)). However, \u201c[a]fter September 9, 2003, the department must issue a new certificate under subsection (1) of this section for a water right represented by a water right permit only for the perfected portion of a water right as demonstrated through actual beneficial use of water.\u201d RCW 90.03.330(4). The legislation essentially put the legislature\u2019s imprimatur on our holding in Theodoratus prospectively while confirming the good standing of water certificates issued under the former system. 23 Butler & King, supra, \u00a7 8.11, at 293.\n\u00b69 In 2006, two groups of challengers sued, contending that several sections of the 2003 amendments were unconstitutional. The two cases were consolidated, and the trial court agreed with the challengers that the amendments to the definition of municipal water suppliers in RCW 90.03.015 and the retroactivity provision of RCW 90.03.330 violated separation of powers as, the court concluded, they effectively overruled Theodoratus. The trial court declined to reach the substantive due process challenges to those three provisions. The judge rejected the remaining facial procedural and substantive due process challenges. We granted review on the motion of all parties.\nANALYSIS\n\u00b610 The challenges before us are facial constitutional challenges to the statutes. \u201cWe presume statutes are constitutional and review challenges to them de novo.\u201d City of Seattle v. Ludvigsen, 162 Wn.2d 660, 668, 174 P.3d 43 (2007) (citing State v. Shultz, 138 Wn.2d 638, 642-43, 980 P.2d 1265 (1999)). \u201cConstruction of the state constitution is a question of law that is reviewed de novo.\u201d State v. Pugh, 167 Wn.2d 825, 835, 225 P.3d 892 (2009) (citing State v. Chenoweth, 160 Wn.2d 454, 462, 158 P.3d 595 (2007)); accord City of Kennewick v. Benton County, 131 Wn.2d 768, 771, 935 P.2d 606 (1997).\n\u00b611 We note that many of the arguments before us might be better raised in an \u201cas applied\u201d challenge.\nAn \u201cas applied\u201d challenge occurs where a plaintiff contends that a statute\u2019s application in the context of the plaintiff\u2019s actions or proposed actions is unconstitutional. If a statute is held unconstitutional as applied, it cannot be applied in the future in a similar context, but it is not rendered completely inoperative. A statute is rendered completely inoperative if it is declared facially unconstitutional. However, a facial challenge must be rejected if there are any circumstances where the statute can constitutionally be applied.\nWash. State Republican Party v. Pub. Disclosure Comm\u2019n, 141 Wn.2d 245, 282 n.14, 4 P.3d 808 (2000) (citing Ire re Det. of Turay, 139 Wn.2d 379, 417 n.28, 986 P.2d 790 (1999)). However, in this case, the challenges are explicitly facial.\n1. Separation of Powers and Statutory Amendments\n\u00b612 The challengers contend, successfully below, that RCW 90.03.015(3), (4), and RCW 90.03.330(3) facially violate separation of powers because they unsettle a decision of this court retroactively. Specifically, they challenge the 2003 amendments in which the legislature defined municipal water suppliers broadly to include private developers whose projects would provide water to more than 15 houses, RCW 90.03.015(3), (4); provided that under certain circumstances, a municipality\u2019s water rights would not be limited to the specified number of service connections or stated population so long as the change is \u201cconsistent with the approved water system plan\u201d among other things, RCW 90.03.260(4), (5); largely made existing water certificates based upon system capacity valid and limited the situations where the Department of Ecology could seek to invalidate a water rights certificate, RCW 90.03.330(2), (3); authorized municipal water suppliers, under certain circumstances, to shift place of use within the boundaries of approved water plans without consulting the Department of Ecology or notifying other water rights\u2019 holders, RCW 90.03.386(2); and allowed existing water rights certificates that would now be considered to be for municipal water services to be so amended, RCW 90.03.560. They contend that these provisions change the requirements noted in Theodoratus for private water rights to vest. They claim that the amendments to RCW 90.03.015(3) and (4) define municipal water suppliers so broadly that Theodoratus would now himself qualify as a municipal water supplier. Further, they note that RCW 90.03.330(3) provides that municipal water suppliers who had water rights certificates issued under the former \u201cpumps and pipes\u201d capacity standard had \u201cright [s] in good standing\u201d even if those rights would not have vested under Theodoratus. See also CP at 617. The State acknowledges that these amendments have some retroactive effect. Opening Br. of Appellant/Cross-Resp\u2019t at 36.\n113 We examined our separation of powers jurisprudence recently in Hale v. Wellpinit School District No. 49, 165 Wn.2d 494, 198 P.3d 1021 (2009). Previously, in McClarty v. Totem Electric, 157 Wn.2d 214, 228, 137 P.3d 844 (2006), we rejected the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d promulgated by the Human Rights Commission in favor of the federal statutory definition. The legislature responded by, for the first time, legislatively defining disability consistent with the Human Rights Commission\u2019s earlier attempt, and made that definition retroactive to all claims that accrued prior to McClarty (as well as, of course, all claims accruing after the effective date of the statute). Hale, 165 Wn.2d at 498. We upheld the retroactive provision against a separation of powers claim.\n\u00b614 In Hale, we began by recognizing the presumption against retroactive application of a statute and the policy behind that presumption. Id. at 507-08. Retroactive application of a statute may violate the ex post facto doctrine, id. at 507 (citing State v. Schmidt, 143 Wn.2d 658, 672-73, 23 P.3d 462 (2001)), or affect vested rights and violate due process, id. (citing State v. Varga, 151 Wn.2d 179, 195, 86 P.3d 139 (2004)). Retroactive changes in the law alter the status quo in the law upon which people should be able to reasonably rely. Id. Retroactive amendments to the law may violate separation of powers by disturbing judgments, interfering with judicial functions, or cause manifest injustice. Thus, as we observed:\nThe presumption against retroactive application of a statute or amendment \u201c \u2018is an essential thread in the mantle of protection that the law affords the individual citizen.\u2019 \u201d [State v.] Cruz, 139 Wn.2d [186,] 190[, 985 P.2d 384 (1999)] (quoting Lynce v.

    "Hicks, J.\nLessor, Washington Hydroculture, Inc., brought a damage action against lessee, Frank Payne, for the cost of rebuilding two leased fiberglass greenhouses destroyed by fire. Summary judgment on liability was granted against lessee based on a provision in the lease commonly called a maintenance and delivery clause. There is no issue of fault, as this is an action on the contract.\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court. Washington Hydroculture, Inc. v. Payne, 26 Wn. App. 40, 610 P.2d 967 (1980). We reverse.\nIn 1975, Frank Payne leased two hydroponic greenhouses located on lessor's property from Washington Hydroculture, Inc. These greenhouses were over 120 feet long and about 26 feet wide and appear to have been affixed to the ground by some sort of foundation. The lease contained a general, unqualified, maintenance and delivery clause as follows:\nDuring the term of this lease, lessee shall maintain said [greenhouses]; and, upon expiration of the term hereof surrender in as good a condition as it shall be when lessee takes possession thereof, except for ordinary wear and tear.\nThe lease was prepared by lessor and, according to lessee's affidavit on the motion for summary judgment, was \"not negotiated by the parties\" nor did the parties ever discuss \"prior to execution of the lease, the risk of loss caused by fire.\"\nThe trial court did not inquire into fault and lessor admits that fault was unalleged and not at issue. The trial court denied lessee's motion for summary judgment and granted lessor's. The trial on damages resulted in an award of $23,780.72 to lessor.\nThere was no clause in the lease requiring lessee to insure the premises, however, lessee did have insurance on the contents. The insurance proceeds paid to lessee on the contents are almost the same amount as the amount awarded to lessor by the trial court.\nThe issue in this case is whether we should retain the rule requiring a tenant, regardless of fault, to rebuild leased premises destroyed by fire, where the tenant has entered into a lease containing a general maintenance and delivery clause with no exceptions other than normal wear and tear.\nPetitioner/lessee asserts that the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case conflicts with our decisional law, specifically with Anderson v. Ferguson, 17 Wn.2d 262, 135 P.2d 302 (1943) and United Mut. Sav. Bank v. Riebli, 55 Wn.2d 816, 350 P.2d 651 (1960). Respondent/lessor asserts that the decision of the trial court and the Court of Appeals in this case is in accord with the common law rule, still effective in this and some other jurisdictions. Respondent/ lessor also relies primarily on Anderson for its position. This confusion can be attributed to a harsh and outdated rule, the effects of which we have in the past attempted to avoid by reasoning around rather than changing.\nThere can be no dispute that the common law rule, and our early rule, was as stated by the Court of Appeals at page 42 in its opinion on this case:\nThus, it appears to be the settled law in this state that an unconditional or unqualified covenant on the part of the lessee to maintain and keep premises leased by him in good repair or in as good condition as that existing at the time specified in the lease, and to return the premises at the expiration or termination of the lease in such equivalent condition, obligates the lessee to rebuild in case the buildings leased are destroyed by fire or other casualty during the term.\nQuoting from Anderson v. Ferguson, supra at 270-71.\nOne of the earliest cases to apply the rule in Washington was Armstrong v. Maybee, 17 Wash. 24, 48 P. 737 (1897), where plaintiff/lessor brought action against a lessee for breach of a covenant in a lease covering a shingle mill, house, office, machinery, and office fixtures, all destroyed by fire during the course of the lease. The covenant in that lease was worded as follows:\nlessee shall maintain all of the machinery and buildings ... in as good condition and repair as the same now are in and return the same ... in as good condition as the same Eire now in, reasonable wear and tear from ordinary use alone excepted.\"\n17 Wash, at 25.\nThe use of the word \"alone\" in the Armstrong lease favors the construction placed on it by the court, holding the lessee liable to rebuild. The Armstrong court's analysis of authorities and decisionEil law indicates that the slightest variation in wording can make the difference between the loss falling on the lessor or the lessee. The court intends to uphold the intent of the parties, as was stated in Armstrong (quoting from a Michigan opinion):\n\"In construing the covenants in a lease the cardinal rule is that the intention of the parties shall govern; and the courts will not extend or enlarge the obligation of the lessee beyond the plain meaning of the language used and the intention existing at the time it was made; and if there is not an express stipulation to the effect to restore buildings and other property leased, destroyed by casualties from fire or water, without fault or neglect on the psirt of the tenant, the loss must fall upon the landlord\n17 Wash, at 28-29.\nThe court went on to hold against lessee, stating that in the case at bar we are unable, from any fair reading of the whole lease, to find any doubtful language or anything in the circumstances of the parties which would require other than one construction of the language used.\n17 Wash, at 29.\nIn Anderson v. Ferguson, 17 Wn.2d 262, 135 P.2d 302 (1943), we approved the rule but avoided applying it, stating that the phraseology of the covenant to repair and deliver in that case, as compared to the language used in the particular lease under consideration in Armstrong, was different. The language of the covenant was as follows:\n\"The said lessee . . . agrees to quit and deliver up the premises ... at the end of the term, in as good order, condition and repair as the reasonable use and wear thereof will permit. ...\"\n17 Wn.2d at 264. The court found the above language did not require by its terms that the lessee maintain or keep the premises in any particular condition whatever during the course of the lease. Also, the premises did not have to be delivered in as good condition as they were in the beginning of the lease but only in as good condition as reasonable use and wear would permit. And the language did not designate a certain point in time for referencing the condition of the premises. \"In any event,\" the court opined, \"the common-law rule is so harsh that it ought not to be applied unless the language of the lease clearly requires it.\" 17 Wn.2d at 273.\nIn United Mut. Sav. Bank v. Riebli, 55 Wn.2d 816, 350 P.2d 651 (1960), the rule once again was retained, but avoided on the phraseology, and by denominating the cause of the damage a \"latent defect\". In that case a water pipe ruptured damaging personal property of the lessee, lessor, and third persons. The latter sued both the lessee and lessor, and despite the fact that the lease contained both a maintenance and delivery clause, and a hold harmless clause, the court was able to avoid application of this harsh rule. The lease provided that the lessee had the duty to keep the premises in good repair, and to quit and surrender the premises \"in good order and condition, reasonable wear and damage by the elements excepted. ...\u201d 55 Wn.2d at 822. The hold harmless clause was clear:\n\"... The Lessee shall keep, save and hold harmless the Lessor from any and all damages and liability for anything and everything whatsoever arising from, or out of the occupancy by, or under, the Lessee, . . . and . . . from any fault or negligence by the Lessee, or any failure on the Lessee's part ... or otherwise, or whether it be caused by, . . . the failure of the Lessee ...11\n(Italics ours.) 55 Wn.2d at 822. The court held that neither the repair and delivery clause nor the hold harmless clause made the lessee insurer for a latent defect on the premises.\nAlthough the general rule at common law was to construe a general repair and delivery clause as requiring a tenant to rebuild, the jurisdictions are split on the issue. See 51C C.J.S. Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 368(7) and \u00a7 412 (1968). It is a much criticized rule, most often on the basis that \"repair\" or \"maintain\" does not mean \"rebuild\". See Stoebuck, The Law Between Landlord and Tenant in Washington, 49 Wash. L. Rev. 291, 361-63, 1090 (1974); Decker, Duties of a Tenant To Rebuild After He Has Covenanted To Repair, 6 Iowa B. Rev. 52 (1940). Other jurisdictions have altered the common law rule on this basis. See cases and text in 1 M. Friedman, Leases, \"Damage and Destruction of Leased Property,\" \u00a7 9.1 (1974):\nSome courts refused to follow the common law rule, and held that a covenant by the tenant to repair did not require the tenant to restore after a nonnegligent fire, this on the ground that one could \"repair\" only something in existence and that a covenant to repair could not require the creation of something new. This distinction between \"repair\" and \"restore\" rescued some tenants who had naively agreed to repair, with no suspicion of what the common law attributed to this covenant. However, a repair is a partial restoration and these terms do not necessarily present a clear contrast. Their difference may be of degree rather than of nature.\n(Footnotes containing citations omitted.) Friedman, Leases, supra at 313.\nThe wording in the covenant in the instant case is not as clear as the wording in Armstrong, and although it does not necessarily fall into the exceptions to the rule that were carved out in previous cases, we do not construe this provision as automatically imposing the duty to rebuild on lessee. The language seems to us to describe a duty to maintain as opposed to an obligation to rebuild. It is time that we abandon a rule imposing liability absent fault based on \"magic\" language, the import of which laymen, or indeed lawyers themselves, may not perceive. As we said in Armstrong, what controls in a lease is the intent of the parties at the time of its execution, and the plain meaning of the language used. Where lessor drafts the lease, ambiguities must be resolved in favor of lessee. Armstrong v. Maybee, supra; Puget Inv. Co. v. Wenck, 36 Wn.2d 817, 221 P.2d 459, 20 A.L.R.2d 1320 (1950). We will not extend the obligation of lessee beyond the plain meaning of the language used, and if there is not an express stipulation requiring lessee to rebuild properties destroyed without fault, the loss will fall on the landlord.\nThe plain meaning of maintain or repair is not synonymous with rebuild. \"Repair\" means \"to amend, not to make a new thing\", stated the Nebraska Supreme Court when abolishing the common law rule in that state in Wattles v. South Omaha Ice & Coal Co., 50 Neb. 251, 69 N.W. 785 (1897). The Supreme Court of California made the same distinction in holding that a covenant to repair did not include the complete rebuilding after destruction by fire through no fault of lessee. Realty & Rebuilding Co. v. Rea, 184 Cal. 565, 194 P. 1024 (1920).\nLessee alleged by affidavit that lessor had advised him that the building was fireproof and that he was wasting his money to insure the contents. There is no insurance provision in the lease requiring lessee to insure the buildings; were there it would indicate an intent by both parties to place liability on lessee. Lessee's affidavit also states that the cause of the fire was defective wiring that he in no way altered during his tenancy.\nWithout inquiry into fault on the part of lessee or intent at the time of execution of the lease, and without language expressly holding lessee responsible for rebuilding premises destroyed through no fault of his own, we cannot sustain the trial court. It defies reason and logic to hold lessee to a covenant containing words of art and magic language which lessor says we should construe as an \"express covenant\" to insure against acts of God and other casualties beyond the control of lessee. It is not express. \"Maintain\" does not mean \"rebuild\". One could agree to surrender premises in as good condition as when possession was taken in conjunction with a clause to maintain, and never contemplate their total destruction requiring rebuilding.\nWe hold that summary judgment is improper where, as here, intent is unclear. The case is remanded for trial in accordance with this opinion.\nBrachtenbach, C.J., and Rosellini, Utter, Dolliver, Williams, and Dimmick, JJ., concur.\nStafford and Dore, JJ., concur in the result."

    "Utter, J.\nWater resource allocation concerns everyone in our state. Its common use for household consumption, agriculture, manufacturing and hydroelectric power makes water a highly coveted resource. While of concern to all, those most acutely affected by developments in our water law live in the more arid portions of our state east of the Cascade Range. The two cases before this court today concern land east of the Cascades and involve the status of riparian rights in Washington water law. See Department of Ecology v. Adsit, 103 Wn.2d 698, 694 P.2d 1065 (1985). In this case, the State appeals from a trial court ruling reversing a referee's determination at a 1982 stream adjudication and issuing a partial summary judgment declaring a riparian's common law rights to water undiminished by the 1917 water code. We reverse the trial judge and hold that the 1917 water code established prior appropriation as the dominant water law in Washington. After 1917, new water rights may be acquired only through compliance with the permit system and existing water rights not put to beneficial use are relinquished. The permit system, modified over time to require a permit for all water put to beneficial use, allows the State to efficiently implement the state water policy, most recently articulated by the Legislature in 1979:\nIt is the policy of the state to promote the use of the public waters in a fashion which provides for obtaining maximum net benefits arising from both diversionary uses of the state's public waters and the retention of waters within streams and lakes in sufficient quantity and quality to protect instream and natural values and rights.\nRCW 90.03.005.\nI\nIn the early 1900's, John Fuher began operating a sawmill on the banks of Deadman Creek on property now owned by Riddle, the respondent in this appeal. The sawmill diverted water from the creek for log washing. In 1921, Fuher moved the sawmill to the opposite bank of the creek and continued to divert water. At that time, he also constructed a small pond which was continuously filled with fresh water. The sawmill continued in operation until the mid-1940's, at about which time respondents acquired the land. In August 1911, after the sawmill was already operating, Fuher filed a notice of appropriation with the Spokane County Auditor declaring his intent to divert 4.0 cubic feet per second (c.f.s.) of water for irrigation and other beneficial uses.\nSixty years later, on September 24, 1971, J. C. Riddle filed water right claim 5924, claiming the right to divert and use 4.0 c.f.s. of the waters of Deadman Creek for irrigation of 200 acres. Although the water has been used for irrigation for at least the last 15 to 20 years, the referee in a 1982 adjudication denied Riddle's claim of a water right of that quantity acquired from Fuher and confirmed a water right of a much smaller amount. The referee indicated that Fuher irrigated only about 15 acres in either 1922 or 1923. Except for the sawmill, there was no evidence of continuous use between the early 1920's and the early 1950's. The trial court, relying on Riddle's status as a riparian, granted Riddle partial summary judgment and remanded to the referee.\nIn reversing the referee, the trial judge declared that a riparian owner's common law rights to \"ordinary\" and \"natural\" (domestic) uses of water were unaffected by either the 1917 water code or the 1969 water rights act. He concluded that the right to \"ordinary\" and \"natural\" uses inheres in the ownership of the property and is neither acquired through actual usage nor lost through disuse. He also concluded that the 1917 code did not require unexer-cised riparian rights to be exercised within any particular time from the June 6, 1917 effective date, nor did it require changes in \"ordinary\" and \"natural\" use to be approved by the State.\nII\nRiparian rights, where they exist, derive from the ownership of land contiguous to or traversed by a watercourse. Crook v. Hewitt, 4 Wash. 749, 749-50, 31 P. 28 (1892) (\"the law is uniformly settled that every proprietor of lands on the bank of a river has naturally an equal right to the use of the water which flows in the stream adjacent to his lands, as it was wont to run, without diminution or alteration\"). Riparian rights in Washington can be traced to an enactment of the territorial Legislature adopting the common law of England as the rule of decision in territorial courts. See Laws of 1862, p. 82, ch. 1; see also Benton v. Johncox, 17 Wash. 277, 280-81, 49 P. 495 (1897).\nThe Washington Constitution did not mention riparian rights. As to water rights, it provides in article 21, section 1 that the \"use of the waters of this state for irrigation, mining and manufacturing purposes shall be deemed a public use.\" No specific guaranty of the vitality of the riparian rights doctrine appeared in either the 1890 or the 1891 implementing legislation. Provision for condemnation of riparian rights in the 1890 act, however, makes clear that riparian rights continued to exist. See Laws of 1889, ch. 21, p. 722, \u00a7 57. The implementing statute passed in 1891 provided:\nThe right to the use of water in any lake, pond or flowing spring in this state, or the right to the use of water flowing in any river, stream or ravine of this state for irrigation, mining or manufacturing purposes, or for supplying cities, towns or villages with water, or for water works, may be acquired by appropriation, and as between appropriations the first in time is the first in right.\nLaws of 1891, ch. 142, \u00a7 1, p. 327. Section 9 of the act read:\nWater appropriated for any of the purposes in this act mentioned may be changed to any other purpose herein specified or to any other beneficial use, and the right to such use shall relate back to the original appropriation.\nThe 1891 act also stated that \"this act shall not be construed to interfere with vested rights.\" Laws of 1891, ch. 142, \u00a7 7, p. 328.\nAppropriative rights, as provided for by statute, and riparian rights, derived from the common law, existed simultaneously. Conflict between riparian and appropriative rights was addressed as early as the first volume of Washington Reports. Geddis v. Parrish, 1 Wash. 587, 21 P. 314 (1889). The \"California\" or dual system of riparian and appropriative rights was fully recognized in our state in Benton v. Johncox, supra. There, the court recognized riparian ownership as superior to subsequent appropriation. Benton, at 288. It further decided that riparian rights date to the inception of title by the government patentee and noted the common law rule \"that every riparian proprietor has an equal right to the use of water as it is accustomed to flow, without diminution or alteration, is subject to the well recognized limitation that each owner may make a reasonable use of the water for domestic, agricultural and manufacturing purposes . . .\". Benton, at 290.\nUnder the common law, mere disuse of riparian rights did not destroy or suspend their existence. Rigney v. Tacoma Light & Water Co., 9 Wash. 576, 38 P. 147 (1894); Lux v. Haggin, 69 Cal. 255, 391, 10 P. 674 (1886). The perpetuity of the right, however, was subject to impairment or destruction through adverse use by others or creation of an estoppel against the riparian proprietor. 2 W. Hutchins, Water Rights Laws in the Nineteen Western States 25 (1974).\nStrict application of the riparian rights doctrine led to problems. The riparian rights doctrine prevented appropriative or riparian development by others, even if the riparian rights had never been exercised. As population density increased, demand for water grew and the vitality of the riparian doctrine began to wane. See Trelease, Coordination of Riparian and Appropriative Rights to the Use of Water, 33 Tex. L. Rev. 24, 25-26 (1954). In 1907, the Supreme Court upheld the 1890 statute which provided that riparian rights may be condemned for irrigation purposes, subject to the irrigation needs of the riparian. State ex rel. Kettle Falls Power & Irrig. Co. v. Superior Court, 46 Wash. 500, 90 P. 650 (1907). The condemnation statute was again at issue later that year. The court discussed the meaning and intention of the phrase \"needed for [irrigation] by any [riparian]11:\nWe think it means the water necessary to irrigate the land of the littoral or riparian owner which he now has under irrigation, and also that which he intends to, and will, place under irrigation within a reasonable time. It cannot be supposed that the legislature intended that a riparian owner could prevent an irrigating company from appropriating water not then in use but which the riparian owner might need and use upon his land at some distant, indefinite time in the future. Such a construction would be in the interest of the speculator rather than for the encouragement of the land improver and home builder. ... If [the riparian] is not using the water and does not propose to use it as soon as practicable in the ordinary and reasonable development or cultivation of his lands, then there is no reason why the water should be withheld from others who need and will promptly use it if permitted.\n(Italics ours.) State ex rel. Liberty Lk. Irrig. Co. v. Superior Court, 47 Wash. 310, 313-14, 91 P. 968 (1907).\nErosion of riparian rights as the dominant force in Washington water law continued with the enactment of the water code of 1917. Until 1917, there existed two ways for a nonriparian owner to obtain an appropriative right to water: by taking water from the public domain and putting it to beneficial use, Thorpe v. Tenem Ditch Co., 1 Wash. 566, 20 P. 588 (1889), or by posting a statutory notice at the point of diversion and commencing construction of the works. Laws of 1891, ch. 142, \u00a7 2, p. 327. The 1917 code abrogated the acts of 1890 and 1891 and provided for a new system of application, permit and certification by the supervisor of hydraulics (now the supervisor of water resources).\nThe water code of 1917 declares that, subject to existing rights, \"all waters within the state belong to the public, and any right thereto . . . shall be hereafter acquired ... in the manner provided and not otherwise . . .\". (Italics ours.) RCW 90.03.010. \"Any person . . . desiring to appropriate water for a beneficial use shall [apply] to the supervisor of water resources for a permit . . . and shall not use or divert such waters until he has received a permit . . .\". RCW 90.03.250. No exception is made for waters devoted to \"ordinary\", \"natural\" or domestic uses. There is no indication that rights which vested before the water code were to be excluded from general water rights adjudications or otherwise treated differently. For example, RCW 90.03.120 calls for service in an adjudication of \"all known persons claiming the right to divert the water involved . . .\". No distinction is made as to the kind of use.\nNothing in the 1917 water code \"shall be construed to lessen, enlarge, or modify the existing rights of any riparian owner, or any existing right acquired by appropriation, or otherwise.\" (Italics ours.) RCW 90.03.010. The code also continued and enlarged condemnation rights by giving any person the power to condemn an inferior use for a superior beneficial use. RCW 90.03.040. Shortly after adoption of the code, the Supreme Court held that a riparian owner intending future use could not prevent condemnation by a nonriparian owner for an immediate use for power. State ex rel. South Fork Log Driving Co. v. Superior Court, 102 Wash. 460, 470, 173 P. 192 (1918) (the test for condemnation is \"the extent and manner of the proposed use as compared with the present use\"). Finally, the 1917 water code required that a change in use of all pre-code vested rights must be approved by the supervisor of hydraulics. RCW 90.03.380.\nThe trial judge in this case, despite the shift away from the primacy of riparian rights by the courts and Legislature, concluded that the appropriative permit system embodied in the 1917 water code applied only to surplus waters in excess of those required for \"ordinary\" or \"natural\" domestic uses by riparians. He also interpreted the forfeiture provisions of the water rights act as applying only to public uses enumerated in article 1, section 16 of the state constitution. Although we need not decide questions concerning that here, even partial adoption of the trial court opinion would effectively create a domestic use exemption from the permit system and state management of water resources. The Legislature did expressly create a domestic exemption in the groundwater code, RCW 90.44-.050, but it has never seen fit to create such an exemption for surface water.\nWe cannot agree with the trial court's conclusion. The trial judge relied on two decisions subsequent to the 1917 water code in concluding that domestic uses did not fall within the purview of the code. Yet, we believe neither of those cases reached that question. Brown v. Chase, 125 Wash. 542, 217 P. 23 (1923) and Proctor v. Sim, 134 Wash. 606, 236 P. 114 (1925) were both concerned with determining whether the clause in the 1917 code protecting the \"existing rights\" of riparian owners, see RCW 90.03.010, applied to unused rights.\nWhether unused riparian rights survived adoption of the use-oriented 1917 water code has been much discussed. See Horowitz, Riparian and Appropriation Rights to the Use of Water in Washington, 7 Wash. L. Rev. 197 (1932); Morris, Washington Water Rights \u2014 A Sketch, 31 Wash. L. Rev. 243 (1956); Johnson, Riparian and Public Rights to Lakes and Streams, 35 Wash. L. Rev. 580 (1960); Corker & Roe, Washington's New Water Rights Law \u2014 Improvements Needed, 44 Wash. L. Rev. 85 (1968). The referee in this case determined that the \"[e]xtent of the right is limited to the amount of water developed and used under diligent pursuance and completion of any project as originally contemplated and which was initiated within three years after the effective date of the 1917 Surface Water Code. (June 6, 1917)\". Report of Referee, at 15.\nBrown v. Chase, supra, presented a contest between riparians whose rights were unexercised and an applicant for an appropriation permit under the 1917 water code. The trial court overturned a permit on the grounds that a riparian owner is entitled to \"the undiminished unpolluted flow of the stream past his land.\" In reversing the trial court, the Supreme Court adopted the approach taken in Kettle Falls Power, and stated:\n[I]n consonance with the general needs and welfare of the state, especially in the arid and semi-arid regions, and in harmony with the legislation upon the matter, we are now prepared to declare . . . that (1) waters of non-navigable streams in excess of the amount which can be beneficially used, either directly or prospectively, within a reasonable time, on, or in connection with riparian lands, are subject to appropriation for use on non-riparian lands.\n(Italics ours.) 125 Wash, at 553, 217 P. at 26-27.\nProctor v. Sim, supra, involved a situation similar to that in Brown v. Chase, supra. The riparian rights concerned derived from ownership of land bordering a nonnavigable lake. The court reasoned, \" [i]t would seem a waste of energy to compel the surplus waters of a stream to labor on arid lands and at the same time permit surplus waters of a lake to lie idle.\" Proctor, 134 Wash, at 619. Read in isolation, attempting to support preferential treatment for domestic use, one might conclude that a substantive difference in the nature of \"surplus\" waters actually exists. However, review of the opinion shows that the term \"surplus\" refers to those waters not already put to use by the riparian. The court determined that the \"existing rights\" which the water code protected referred to \"the right to the beneficial use of such portions of the waters ... as are either directly or prospectively, within a reasonable time, proper and necessary for the irrigation of their lands and for the usual domestic purposes.\" Proctor v. Sim, supra at 615-16.\nBrown v. Chase, supra, and Proctor v. Sim, supra, are not surprising decisions when viewed in light of the movement toward use-oriented rights. In a dual system, nonuse of any riparian rights results in their forfeiture. J. Sax, Water Law, Planning and Policy 287 (1968); see State v. American Fruit Growers, Inc., 135 Wash. 156, 237 P. 498 (1925). On the other hand, Brown v. Chase, supra, and Proctor v. Sim, supra, both imply that the code did not extinguish unused water rights as of 1917 but as of a later date, adequate to allow riparian owners to learn about the code and take steps to protect their interests. Many commentators, and several courts, have determined that either the statute or the decisional law of this court has eliminated unused riparian rights. Disagreement, however, is widespread as to when that relinquishment occurred. See Corker & Roe, 44 Wash. L. Rev. at 114-18; see also 2 W. Hutchins, Water Rights Laws in the Nineteen Western States 14 (1974). The time when relinquishment occurred must be settled to decide today's case.\nSix years after Proctor v. Sim, supra, was decided, four members of Department One of this court agreed that a claim to riparian rights which had not and would not be exercised \"within a reasonable time\" was properly rejected by a trial court reviewing an adjudication. In re Sinlahekin Creek, 162 Wash. 635, 299 P. 649 (1931). Because Sinlahekin Creek and the other cases applying the \"reasonable time\" standard are all forward looking, the Department of Ecology suggests 1932 as the date by which unused riparian rights must have been put to use or forfeited. Our cases support adoption of that year as the cutoff date for exercise of unused riparian rights; 15 years after enactment of the water code, we now hold, as a matter of law, constitutes adequate notice.\nThe referee's denial of Riddle's claim based on Fuher's riparian status was proper. No rights sought were exercised for irrigation purposes prior to 1917. Fuher lost his claim to these unexercised riparian rights by 1932 and therefore transferred only those exercised to Riddle.\nRespondents assert that the sawmill use through the 1940's, along with their predecessor's irrigation use, supports retention of a right based on Fuher's beneficial use. Generally, an appropriator is not limited to the use for which the appropriation was initially made. See In re Alpowa Creek, 129 Wash. 9, 224 P. 29 (1924).\nSince 1917, however, by statute changes in use must first be approved by the supervisor of water resources. In this case, a change in use from log washing to irrigation should be allowed only if an application to do so was filed with and approved by the supervisor of water resources. Neither Fuher nor Riddle appears to have sought approval for the change in use.\nIll\nRiddle asserts that the forfeiture of riparian rights for nonuse effects an unconstitutional taking. In Washington, we have previously held that the permit requirement for bringing a water right into existence in the first instance is a reasonable exercise of the State's police power. Peterson v. Department of Ecology, 92 Wn.2d 306, 596 P.2d 285 (1979). In other states, it is well established that riparian rights may be extinguished or limited by statute. 2 W. Hutchins, at 290-97. That a state has the power to either modify or reject the doctrine of riparian rights because unsuited to the conditions in the state and to put into effect the doctrine of prior appropriation has long been settled. See, e.g., Baumann v. Smrha, 145 F. Supp. 617, 624 (D. Kan.), aff'd, 352 U.S. 863 (1956); In re Water Rights of Hood River, 114 Or. 112, 227 P. 1065 (1924).\nNeither the Legislature nor our courts have gone so far as to eliminate riparian rights, as other states have. Consumptive, recreational and aesthetic riparian rights are considered to be vested property rights. Department of Ecology v. Acquavella, 100 Wn.2d 651, 674 P.2d 160 (1983); Bach "

    "Hill, J.\nThe plaintiffs, Raymond E. Magerstaedt and Maxine Magerstaedt, his wife, owned and operated a restaurant in space which they leased on the street floor of a seven-story building. After they had occupied this space for almost 5 years, the ceiling (plaster and metal lath) over part of the area occupied by them fell, causing considerable property damage; and, in consequence thereof, Mrs. Mager-staedt sustained some personal injuries. The restaurant was closed for 3 weeks while the entire ceiling was replas-tered and the premises repainted.\nThe plaintiffs brought this action to recover damages against their lessor, the owner of the building, and also the contractor who was, at that time, preparing the premises adjacent to the plaintiffs for a new tenant, the Washington State Liquor Control Board. The same contractor had, during an earlier period, made substantial changes and alterations in the upper floors of the building including the second floor immediately above the premises occupied by the plaintiffs. They alleged negligence against the lessor and the contractor for the manner in which the work had been done and for failure to provide proper and necessary support for said plaster ceiling.\nAt the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 case, the trial court dismissed the action on the basis that the terms of their lease prevented any recovery against the lessor, unless its actions in altering and renovating other parts of the building had caused the damage, and that there was no evidence that any such action had caused the ceiling to fall, and that no actionable negligence had been established.\nThe plaintiffs appeal.\nThe plaintiffs had leased the premises for 5 years (from April 1, 1956) from University Building Company, a corporation, a former owner of the building. In 1958, the defendant, The Eric Company, a corporation, had become the owner of the building; and in February, 1961, the plaintiffs had executed a renewal lease for another 5-year period with that company; however, the first 5-year lease had not yet expired when the ceiling fell.\nThe trial court, speaking of these leases, said:\n\u201cThe lease which was signed, and which was again renewed shortly before this occurrence, has the following provisions that I deem applicable to this situation.\n\u201cIt states in the third paragraph: [] \u2018That the lessee,\u2019 that is the Plaintiff here, \u2018has examined the above described premises and accepts said premises with their appurtenances and fixtures in their present condition and finds the same to be in good repair,\u2019 which is quite a recital, at least at the time of the renewal here, \u2018and hereby covenants and agrees to keep all thereof in good repair, and further agrees to make all necessary repairs of whatsoever nature to the same, except, however, repairs to the structural bearing parts of the building, the roof, exterior walls and foundation.\u2019\n\u201cI will rule as a matter of law that the ceiling here was not a structural bearing part of this building.\n\u201cThe sixth provision![] is broader. It provides that \u2018the lessee,\u2019 that is the Plaintiff, \u2018will not hold the lessor liable for any damages to property or persons caused by or arising out of any defect in the construction, maintenance, or use of the premises, their fixtures, appurtenances, or of the building fixtures and appurtenances of which the premises constitute a part.\u2019\n\u201cThis warranty says that the lessee, the Plaintiff, will not hold the lessor liable for any damage to property or persons caused by any defect in construction or maintenance.\n\u201cI believe I would interpret that to be a good contract, if written instruments are to have any meaning at all.\n\u201cThe fact that people carelessly do not read the fine print can be no defense, but I would interpret that to mean any defect in the construction or maintenance, meaning the present construction and ordinary maintenance \u2014 any damage he commits, to property or persons, caused by defect in construction or maintenance \u2014 I believe that is the present construction and ordinary maintenance of the building, and I do not believe that would protect them from damages caused by an unusual circumstance; remodeling of the building.\u201d\nSupporting the position of the defendant-lessor, that these provisions of the contract bar any action against it, and construing language of somewhat similar import is our unanimous en banc opinion in Griffiths v. Henry Broderick, Inc. (1947), 27 Wn. (2d) 901, 182 P. (2d) 18, 175 A.L.R. 1.\nWe have here no issue of fraud \u2014 no contention that the plaintiffs did not understand the contract they were signing with the lessor. As the trial court said,\n\u201cI believe I would interpret that to be a good contract, if written instruments are to have any meaning at all.\u201d\nHowever, we will consider the case on the same bases that the trial court used in entering the judgment of dismissal.\nThe trial judge indicated, in the language which we have quoted, that, in his opinion, the lease provisions would not protect the lessor from the liability for damages caused by any unusual circumstance such as the remodeling of the interior of the building.\nHe discussed the issue of causation from two points of view: (a) was there any causation between the remodeling done by the lessor (through its contractor, the defendant E. F. Shuck Construction Company) on the upper floors or in the adjacent space to the north, and the falling of the ceiling; and (b) was there any causation between the negligence, if any, of the contractor in doing such work and the falling of the ceiling. Concerning (a), he pointed out that the burden is upon the plaintiff to show that the falling of the ceiling was not caused by any defect in construction or maintenance, but by the remodeling. He said:\n\u201c. . . then we have the next question of whether or not there has been a causal relation shown from which the jury could find from the evidence, rather than speculation, that the proximate cause of this piece of plaster falling was some act done in carrying on the remodeling.\n\u201cNow, if there had been any of this throwing around of two by fours, or placing heavy weights directly above this point, or wheeling wheelbarrows over it, done within some reasonable time, say thirty days, it might create a question, but here it was, according to the testimony, probably over a year before, except as to work done in a liquor store.\nThe work done on the premises to be occupied by the Washington State Liquor Control Board, immediately adjacent to the premises occupied by the plaintiffs, had involved prying on a wall between the two premises causing plaster to fall from the restaurant wall (which plaster was replaced by the construction company), and had caused the wall to give.\nThe trial judge properly concluded that there was a hiatus of proof as to any connection between the prying on the wall and the falling of a section of the ceiling more than half way across the premises from the wall which had been pried. Had there been a connection between any of the claimed acts of negligence and the falling of the ceiling on the plaintiffs\u2019 premises, the proof was as readily available to the plaintiffs as to the defendants. As the trial judge said,\n\u201cI cannot find that there is evidence from which the jury can make those findings by the preponderance of the evidence.\n\u201cI find that there is an equal probability that . . . this plastering was old and defective . . . that would be a defect in construction.\u201d\nThe lease specifically insulated the lessor from any damage to persons or property \u201carising out of any defect in the construction, maintenance, or use of the demised premises.\u201d\nWith reference to (b), i.e., causation between the claimed negligence of the defendant-contractor and the falling of the ceiling, the situation on the issue of causation is the same. The claimed acts of negligence, as listed, are:\n\u201c(1) Punching holes in the ceiling over appellants\u2019 restaurant . . .\n\u201c(2) Allowing water to overflow on the second floor directly over appellants\u2019 restaurant . . .\n\u201c (3) Throwing lumber down on the second floor directly over appellants\u2019 restaurant . . .\n\u201c (4) Constructing a ramp across which wheelbarrows of building material were transported directly over appellants\u2019 restaurant . . .\n\u201c(5) Failing to make adequate inspection of the ceiling over appellants\u2019 restaurant after the collapse of the portion of the ceiling in an area adjacent to appellants\u2019 restaurant\n\u201c(6) Prying on the common wall between appellants\u2019 restaurant and an area adjacent thereto, which prying knocked plaster from the walls of the restaurant and caused a restaurant wall to \u2018give\u2019 . . . \u201d\nSeveral of these seem to us to be no more than normal operating procedure in an extensive remodeling of a seven-story building; but, assuming that all, except \u201c(5)\u201d which is a claimed failure to inspect, did constitute negligence, \u201c(2), (3)\u201d and \u201c(4)\u201d had all occurred more than a year before the ceiling fell and were too remote to require any serious consideration. .\n\u201c(1)\u201d involved the punching of holes in the ceiling over a balcony. These holes were in a portion of the ceiling over the balcony at the western end of the plaintiffs\u2019 premises, which did not collapse and which was some distance removed from the section near the front entrance at the eastern end of the premises which did collapse. Repairs were immediately made after the punching of each hole. There is no testimony that these mishaps had anything to do with the fall of the section of the ceiling with which we are here concerned.\n\u201c(6),\u201d the prying of the common wall in connection with the remodeling next door for the liquor store, which knocked plaster off the wall in the plaintiffs\u2019 premises, is the closest in point of time to the falling of the ceiling which caused the damage to the plaintiffs. There is no evidence that the so-called \u201cprying\u201d affected the ceiling, and no explanation of how it could have caused the metal lath, over which the plaster was placed, to break loose from the joists.\n\u201c(5)\u201d is predicated on a failure to inspect the ceiling after the fail of a four-by-eight section of the ceiling in the premises being remodeled for a liquor store, which occurred more than a month earlier. The ceilings were of different construction; the ceiling over the plaintiffs\u2019 premises being plaster over metal lath, while the plaster which fell on the liquor store premises had been placed on \u201cbutton board, or plasterboard,\u201d and the plaster which fell was from one four-by-eight section of the \u201cbutton board, or plasterboard.\u201d\n. The- superintendent for the contractor, called as an adverse witness, testified that after this plaster fell he did inspect the ceiling over the premises occupied by the plaintiffs and saw nothing wrong with it. There is no suggestion of what further inspection should have been made, or what it would-have disclosed.\nThe plaintiffs, in their brief as appellants, say:\n\u201cIt would be virtually impossible to .state with certainty which act of negligence led to the collapse of the ceiling. It may well be that all acts contributed in some manner. But at least the plaintiffs were entitled to have a jury consider whether or not some or all of the acts of negligence proximately caused damage and injury to appellants.\nWe disagree with the conclusion that, with absolutely no evidence of causation, a jury is entitled to guess whether some or all of the claimed acts of negligence proximately caused the ceiling to fall. This rises no higher than multiplied speculation and conjecture in an area where reasonable certainty was possible. The plaintiffs fail to show how the metal lath was affixed to the joists. To have proved a case for the jury, a plastering contractor, a building contractor, or someone familiar with construction should have testified to the type of construction and, at least, suggested one or more things that could have caused the plaster and metal lath ceiling to fall. The plaintiff Raymond Magerstaedt, in his testimony, suggested that the ceiling \u201chad been up there since 1889, or something like that.\u201d\nIt would appear that the plaintiffs were depending on res ipsa loquitur to carry the case to the jury and to put the burden of going forward with exculpatory evidence on the defendants.\nFor various reasons, res ipsa loquitur has no application in this case.\nIn the first place, the plaintiffs proved six acts of claimed negligence which, they say, may separately or collectively have caused the section of plaster ceiling to fall. What further negligence is to be inferred? Actually, the situation is that the plaintiffs offer proof of claimed negligence, but rely on res ipsa loquitur to prove causation and thus carry the case to the jury. This would require some other Latin phrase meaning: Having proved negligent acts, it will be inferred that the claimed negligent acts caused the event which occasioned the damages. The contention here is not that there may be some other act of negligence to be inferred, beyond the six we have discussed, but that the jury should consider \u201cwhether or not some or all of the acts of negligence proximately caused damage and injury to appellants.\u201d Having proved the negligence, it must still be proved, absent such a suggested phrase, that some act of negligence was a proximate cause of the happening which has resulted in the damages to persons and property which the plaintiffs seek to recover.\nIn the second place, res ipsa loquitur has no application where a tenant sues his landlord for personal injuries or property damage caused by the falling of plaster from a ceiling of the leased premises. As the cases indicate, it is difficult to conceive of a situation where the landlord has such control of the floor or the ceiling of leased premises as makes it possible to say that he has such exclusive control, management, or special knowledge of the condition thereof as would support the applicability of res ipsa loquitur.\nPlaster falling on a customer in a hotel room, a store, or a theatre where the owner or operator has the exclusive control of the ceiling and the means of knowledge superior to those of the plaintiffs in such cases, has caused many courts to say res ipsa loquitur applies. McCleod v. Nel-Co Corp. (1953), 350 Ill. App. 216, 112 N. E. (2d) 501, reviews many of the decisions.\nHowever, we find no plaster-falling-from-the-ceiling case where res ipsa loquitur has been applied when the relationship was that of landlord and tenant, and McCleod v. Nel-Co Corp., supra, recognizes the distinction. Res ipsa loquitur was discussed in Wadleigh v. Bumford (1918), 229 Mass. 122, 118 N. E. 265, where the plaintiff, a tenant, was injured when the ceiling of her kitchen fell. Two weeks previously the ceiling had been replastered by an agent of the defendant, the lessor. The court there said:\n\u201c. . . Other than such inference as may be drawn from the fall of the plaster, no evidence was offered to prove either faulty composition of the material used or unskilled and unworkmanlike application of the coating to the ceiling. Nor was there any evidence to exclude the inference of the operation of other causes which might have produced the accident. We are of [the] opinion that the mere occurrence of the accident raised no presumption against the defendant.\u201d (p. 123)\nAnother statement, on the reason for refusing to apply res ipsa loquitur in landlord-tenant cases involving falling plaster, is found in Slater v. Barnes (1925), 241 N. Y. 284, 149 N.E. 859, where a tenant sued the landlord for damages caused by the fall of plaster from the ceiling in an apartment. The trial court tried the case on the theory that res ipsa loquitur would take the case to the jury. A judgment for the plaintiff was reversed, the court saying:\n\u201c. . . That rule [res ipsa loquitur] amongst other things is predicated upon the condition that the agency which has produced an injury is within the exclusive possession, control and oversight of the person charged with negligence whence, legitimately, flows the inference that if there is any explanation of the accident consistent with freedom from negligence, he ought to be able to give that explanation, and if he does not give it, a presumption arises against him. The reason for and common sense of this rule under such conditions is obvious. It frequently happens in the law that if a person fails to explain that of which apparently he has knowledge the presumption goes against him. (Griffen v. Manice, 166 N. Y. 188.)\n\u201cBut that condition did not exist at all in this case. This piece of plaster, on plaintiff\u2019s theory, had remained in place for four years without so far as appears any sign of weakness or unsafe condition as the result of negligent repair in 1913. We can imagine that a variety of causes might have made it fall after a lapse of four years. But however many or potential these causes may have been there is nothing to indicate that the defendant had any opportunity to observe them. He was not in possession of the premises or at a post of observation and, therefore, when the trial judge erroneously imposed upon him this duty of explanation of something which happened beyond the realm of his observation or control, he in effect instructed the jury to find a verdict against him.\u201d (p. 287)\nOne of the most interesting cases involving falling ceiling plaster is Asheim v. Fahey (1943), 170 Ore. 330, 133 P. (2d) 246, 145 A.L.R. 861. The defendants were tenants of a building in Portland. They occupied the second floor of the building and sub-leased to others two storerooms on the street floor. In one of these storerooms plaster fell from the ceiling onto the plaintiff, who was an employee and also an officer of the corporate sub-tenant.\nAs in the present case, the trial court had dismissed at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case; and the Supreme Court concluded its opinion with these words:\n\u201cWe are of the opinion that the plaintiff failed to introduce sufficient evidence of negligence to take the case to the jury, and that, because of the fact that the defendants did not have exclusive possession or control of the demised premises, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur does not apply. The learned trial judge was correct in his ruling on defendants\u2019 motion for involuntary nonsuit. The judgment is affirmed.\u201d (p. 344)\nAs we pointed out in Chase v. Beard (1959), 55 Wn. (2d) 58, 65, 346 P. (2d) 315, res ipsa loquitur is a mere rule of evidence which permits a jury to infer negligence or want of care from the proof of injury and attendant circumstances. Professor Wigmore points out that its particular force and justice consists in the circumstance that the chief evidence of the true cause is practically accessible to the defendant but inaccessible to the injured person. 9 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940) \u00a7 2509.\nIn the present case, there was no element of exclusive control of the ceiling in the defendant; and the evidence of what caused the plaster to fall was equally accessible to both parties.\nWe find no cases, and the plaintiffs-appellants cite none, where res ipsa loquitur has been applied to take a tenant\u2019s case against a landlord to the jury where the action involved damages from falling plaster.\nThe appellants, in their briefs on appeal, suggest for the first time (so far as the record before us discloses) that they were entitled to maintain an action ex contractu on the theory of a breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. This theory of recovery, not having been presented to the trial court, will not be considered. Malstrom v. Kalland (1963), 62 Wn. (2d) 732, 384 P. (2d) 613. However, unless the landlord is an- insurer that the ceiling will not fall, we fail to see what has been done that breached any covenant of quiet enjoyment.\nThe judgment of dismissal is affirmed.\nOtt, C. J., Hunter and Hale, JJ., and Rummel, J. Pro Tern., concur.\nJuly 16, 1964. Petition for rehearing denied.\nBased on the area designated by Mr. Magerstaedt, by mark"

    "Rosellini, J.\nThis is an inverse condemnation action which the trial court dismissed on motions of the defendants for summary judgment.\nThe action was commenced by the owner of 61.3 acres of unplatted land in Steilacoom, Washington. The theory of the action, as settled upon after several pretrial conferences, was that the defendants, the Town of Steilacoom and County of Pierce, had, in approving plans for storm drainage facilities to be constructed by land developers in conjunction with subdivision plats of lands lying east of the plaintiff\u2019s land, effected a taking or damaging of its property. The taking or damaging allegedly resulted from the fact that storm sewers and ditches which were constructed pursuant to the plans, carried onto the plaintiff\u2019s lands more water than would have naturally reached the land and deposited it in a manner different from the natural flow.\nAffidavits which were before the court upon the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment showed that there was upon the plaintiff\u2019s land a natural swamp into which surface waters from all of the platted areas naturally drained. A natural watercourse flowed from the northern side of this swamp, over a rim or bluff, down through the town and into Puget Sound. The flow of water was controlled by the superintendent of utilities for the Town of Steilacoom, so that the water in the swamp was maintained at the level at which it had stood prior to the development of the subdivisions.\nIt was the allegedly limited capacity of this watercourse which concerned the plaintiff\u2019s expert engineer, who stated in his affidavit that, while the watercourse had a sufficient capacity to carry all the water which would have been drained from the plaintiff\u2019s land if he had drained it and developed it, provided the lands to the east had remained in their natural condition, it did not have sufficient capacity to drain the plaintiff\u2019s land and carry away the water which was brought to it from the developed lands above. He stated that the watercourse could handle the waters carried to the plaintiff\u2019s lands by the storm drainage facilities only if the plaintiff\u2019s land was used as a holding basin.\nThis engineer\u2019s affidavit stated that the subdivision and development of the platted lands had created a runoff of surface water that made storm drainage necessary. It further stated that prior to the development of the platted lands, surface water that might otherwise have collected by reason of rains was dissipated by evaporation, transpiration, and percolation into the ground. It declared:\nThe removal of timber and undergrowth, and the substitution of streets, driveways, homes, and the like, changes the character of the land to such an extent that the subdeveloper must anticipate that 30%, or more, of any rainfall will be carried away by storm drainage facilities\n9. If no waters were carried to the plaintiff\u2019s lands by the storm drainage systems of the Town of Steilacoom and Pierce County, Washington, the plaintiff\u2019s lands could be entirely drained by a ditch or pipe connecting the lowest elevations of the land with the natural watercourse which begins in the westerly portion of the plaintiff\u2019s lands.\nThis affidavit showed that surface waters collected within the platted lands was discharged upon the plaintiff\u2019s lands through five outlets, either ditches or pipes, and that at each outlet ditches were extended onto the plaintiff\u2019s lands.\nThe defendants\u2019 affidavits showed that water from all the lands in question naturally drained into the swamp on the plaintiff\u2019s land, that no new sources of water had been diverted from their natural flow into the storm sewer system, and that the water table in the swamp had remained the same before and after the development of the platted lands.\nAn affidavit of a real estate appraiser filed on behalf of the plaintiff, stated that the market value of the land had been adversely affected by reason of the fact that surface water was being collected and discharged upon the land from storm sewers.\nThe trial court was of the apparent view that the uncontradicted statement in the defendants\u2019 affidavits that the water level had not risen in the swamp, was proof that the amount of water discharged upon the land from the storm sewer system was not greater than the amount which had drained there naturally before the platted lands were developed. While it recognized that the defendants had trespassed upon the plaintiff\u2019s land to construct ditches for the channeling of the water, it was of the apparent opinion that any damage resulting was of a temporary nature and not compensable in this action.\nA municipality ordinarily is not liable for consequential damages occurring when it increases the flow of surface water onto an owner\u2019s property if the damages arise wholly from changes in the character of the surface produced by the opening of streets, building of houses, and the like, in the ordinary and regular course of the expansion of the municipality. On the other hand, it is liable if, in the course of an authorized construction, it collects surface water by an artificial channel or in large quantities and pours it, in a body, upon the land of a private person, to his injury. Under this rule, while municipal authorities may pave and grade streets and are not ordinarily liable for an increase in surface water naturally falling on the land of a private owner where the work is properly done, they are not permitted to concentrate and gather such water into artificial drains or channels and throw it on the land of an individual owner in such manner and volume as to cause substantial injury to such land and without making adequate provision for its proper outflow, unless compensation is made. 18 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \u00a7 53.144, at 538 (3d ed. rev. 1963). See Noyes v. Cosselman, 29 Wash. 635, 70 P. 61 (1902). Surface waters may not be artificially collected and discharged upon adjoining lands in quantities greater than or in a manner different from the natural flow thereof. Colella v. King County, 72 Wn.2d 386, 433 P.2d 154 (1967); King County v. Boeing Co., 62 Wn.2d 545, 384 P.2d 122 (1963). At the same time, it is the rule that the flow of surface water along natural drains may be hastened or incidentally increased by artificial means, so long as the water is not ultimately diverted from its natural flow onto the property of another. Laurelon Terrace, Inc. v. Seattle, 40 Wn.2d 883, 246 P.2d 1113 (1952). ^\nHere it is not contended that there has been any diversion of waters from the direction in which they would naturally flow and onto the land of plaintiff. There is, however, a contention that the amount of water has been increased, as a result of the changes in the surface of the soil effected with the approval of the defendants, and there has been a change in the manner of flow, which have resulted in damage to the plaintiff. The affidavit of the plaintiff\u2019s engineer supports both of these contentions. The mere fact that the plaintiff\u2019s engineer does not dispute the fact that the water table in the swamp has not risen does not settle the question whether the amount of water reaching the plaintiff\u2019s land has increased. The defendants\u2019 affidavits show that the water table is deliberately maintained by their agent, who controls the amount of water flowing from the natural watercourse on the west side of the plaintiff\u2019s land. Thus if there is a greater amount of water reaching the plaintiff\u2019s land, the extra water is being drained off by the defendants\u2019 agent.\nHowever, as we-understand the plaintiff\u2019s theory, it is not so much the increased amount of water reaching its land which has caused the drainage problem as it is the fact that the water is being delivered more swiftly and in large amounts rather than in the slow diffuse manner in which it traveled when the platted lands were in their natural state.\nUnder the rules which we have noted, the mere fact that the amount of water reaching the plaintiff\u2019s land, by reason of the development of the platted lands, might be greater than it formerly was, would not entitle it to compensation for any resulting damage. But the fact that the water is collected and deposited upon the land in a different manner does afford a basis for relief, if resulting damage can indeed be proved to the satisfaction of the trier of the facts.\nThis is not a case where the municipality has collected water and directed it into a natural waterway, as in Strickland v. Seattle, 62 Wn.2d 912, 385 P.2d 33 (1963), where we denied recovery to a riparian owner who complained that in collecting water in ditches and sewers and directing it into a natural watercourse, the city had increased the velocity and turbulence of the stream and the rate of flow of silt, with the result that a delta was being built up in the land at the end of the stream.\nThe allegation that the manner in which the water is deposited upon the plaintiff\u2019s land affects the ability to drain that land, may be difficult to prove to the trier of the facts but it is a material question at issue in the case, and not one upon which summary judgment could properly be granted.\nCertainly the ditching done upon the plaintiff\u2019s land is compensable, if it has in fact resulted in damage. Whether it is regarded as a trespass, temporary in nature, or an appropriation of easements across the plaintiff\u2019s lands to carry the water on its way to its ultimate destination, the necessary parties are before the court and there is no reason to relegate the plaintiff to another action to have its rights determined. See Civil Rule for Superior Court 18.\nWe find in the record some acknowledgement on the part of the defendants that they should have made provision for the proper outflow of the water to a natural watercourse, when they gathered the water into artificial drains and cast it upon the land in a manner different from that by which it would have reached the land in its natural state. We think such a duty is in harmony with the cases which we have cited above, if in fact the manner in which the water is collected and directed onto the land has resulted in damage, a question to be determined by the trier of the facts.\nIn considering a motion for summary judgment, the court must consider all evidence and all reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party and summary judgment will be granted only if reasonable men could reach only one conclusion. Meissner v. Simpson Timber Co., 69 Wn.2d 949, 421 P.2d 674 (1966). The plaintiff offered evidence that his land had been damaged as a result of the collecting and discharge of surface waters upon his land in an unnatural manner. He claimed a large amount of damage and may be able to prove only a minimum; nevertheless, he should have his day in court.\nWhen the first of the 18 subdivisions which are involved in this litigation was platted, and prior to its approval by the Town of Steilacoom, the developer secured from the plaintiff\u2019s two controlling stockholders (who admit that it is their alter ego) a release whereby the owners consented to\nthe natural flow of surface water from said plat to be carried in its natural channel across the property of the [owners] and to hold the Town of Steilacoom blameless for any damage that may be caused by said drainage flow\nThe trial court held that this docupient released the Town of Steilacoom from any liability for damage resulting from the flow of waters from the other 17 subdivisions, as well as the first.\nThis document does not purport to pertain to any plat other than the one which was then under consideration, to which reference was made therein. Furthermore, it does not purport to authorize the collecting of water by artificial means and depositing of it upon the land of the plaintiff. It was drawn by the town and must be construed against it. We do not find the release broad enough in its terms to preclude this action.\nThe judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.\nHale, C.J., and Finley, Hunter, Hamilton, Stafford, Wright, Utter, and Brachtenbach, JJ., concur.\nPetition for rehearing denied August 9, 1974."

    "Hunter, J.\n\u2014 The plaintiff (petitioner), Lulu Owens Geise, a tenant in a mobile home park, brought suit against the defendants (respondents), Wallace Lee and Jane Doe Lee, doing business as Lazy Wheels Mobile Home Park, for injuries incurred by slipping on snow and ice which had accumulated in a common area of the park. The Lazy Wheels Mobile Home Park, located in Bothell, Washington, is comprised of approximately 100 spaces for mobile homes. Between the rows of spaces provided for the homes are driveways intended for both vehicular and pedestrian use, neither of which is exclusive in any given spot. All tenants were free to share these driveways in common with each other for their own particular needs.\nThe plaintiff is 61 years old and has been a tenant of the park since 1965. During the period beginning on January 23, 1972, and continuing until January 26, 1972, a total of approximately 12 to 14 inches of snow fell and accumulated in the driveways. During the following week, melting and freezing conditions combined with passing cars, caused ridges of ice, 4 to 6 inches in height, to form throughout the common areas creating a hazardous condition for any tenant who ventured into these expanses. The defendants had actual knowledge of this condition, having been informed by both the plaintiff and other tenants. Several of the residents of the park had fallen, resulting in one being taken to the hospital.\nIn spite of these'adverse conditions, no attempt was ever made to clear the common areas for the benefit of the tenants, a large percentage of whom were retired individuals. On February 1, 1972, the plaintiff, while carefully making her way to her. sister\u2019s car, slipped and fell on the ice causing serious injury to her person. As a result of this accident, the plaintiff initiated this action alleging that the defendants were negligent in failing to exercise reasonable care to keep the common areas under their control in a reasonably safe condition. The defendants moved for summary judgment supported solely by the facts surrounding the accident and Mr. Lee\u2019s affidavit which stated:\nI am the owner and proprietor of the trailer park where Mrs. Geise rented a space. In the January-F\u00e9bruary snow of 1972,1 did not clean the street where she fell prior to her fall. I did not want to assume the responsibility of keeping the streets clear of snow and ice, and all the tenants knew it.\nThe trial' court granted the defendants\u2019 motion on the grounds- that they did not owe any duty to the plaintiff under .these facts. This decision was unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeals in Geise v. Lee, 10 Wn. App. 728, 519 P.2d 1005 (1974). The case comes before us upon our granting the plaintiff\u2019s petition for review.\nThe sole issue before this court is whether a landlord or owner has a duty to exercise reasonable care in providing safe common areas upon his rental premises, free from dangerous accumulations of snow and ice,, absent a prior undertaking of such a service.\n- The general rule in'the United States is that where an owner divides his premises and rents certain parts to various -tenants, while reserving other, parts such as entrances and walkways for th\u00e9 common use of all tenants, it is his duty to exercise reasonable care and maintain these common areas in a safe condition. See Landlord\u2019s liability to tenant or tenants invitees for injury or death due to ice or snow in areas or passageways used in common by tenants, Annot., 49 A.L.R.3d 387, 393 (1973). The dispute in the instant case arises due to a distinct division between courts from various jurisdictions in regard to the removal of natural accumulations of snow and ice. The older view, referred to as the Massachusetts rule, stems from the case of Woods v. Naumkeag Steam Cotton Co., 134 Mass. 357, 45 Am. Rep. 344 (1883). This decision articulated an exception to the general rule stated above by holding that a landlord was under no duty to the tenants to remove snow and ice from common passageways, unless he had undertaken this duty in the past. Their decision was premised on the belief that to hold otherwise would place too great a burden on the landlord. In 1910, this state adopted the Massachusetts rule in Oerter v. Ziegler, 59 Wash. 421, 109 P. 1058 (1910), and subsequently reaffirmed it in Schedler v. Wagner, 37 Wn.2d 612, 225 P.2d 213, 230 P.2d 600, 26 A.L.R.2d 604 (1950). The defendants, in the instant case, argue that these decisions are still controlling. The plaintiff contends that the better view is that enunciated in Reardon v. Shimelman, 102 Conn. 383, 128 A. 705, 39 A.L.R. 287 (1925), commonly referred to as the Connecticut rule. We agree with the plaintiff. The court there said on page 388:\nThe duty of the landlord being to exercise reasonable care to prevent the occurrence of defective or dangerous conditions in the common approaches, the fact that' a particular danger arose from the fall of snow or the freezing of ice can afford no ground of distinction. Indeed, the causes which are at work to produce it are no more natural causes than are those which, more slowly, bring about the decay of wood or the rusting of iron. To set apart this particular source of danger is to create a distinction without a sound difference.\nThis approach has rapidly replaced the Massachusetts rule and is representative of the modern trend which has been adopted by a majority of jurisdictions. The primary reason for the wide acceptance of the Connecticut rule stems from judicial recognition of changing conditions within the ever expanding boundaries of the landlord-tenant relationship. These courts have concluded that the landlord, is best situated to cope with the hazards presented by snow and ice. The Supreme Court of Rhode Island recently summarized the logic underlying its adherence to the majority view as follows:\nWe believe that today a landlord, armed with an ample supply of salt, sand, scrapers, shovels and even perhaps a snow blower, can acquit himself quite admirably as he takes to the common passageways to do battle with the fallen snow, the s\u00fcn-melted snow now turned to ice, or the frozen rain. We fail to see the rationale for a rule which grants a seasonal exemption from liability to a landlord because he has failed to take adequate precautions against the hazards that can arise from the presence of unshoveled snow or unsanded or salt-free ice found in the areas of his responsibility but yet hold him liable on a year-round basis for other types of defects, attributable to the workings of mother nature in the very same portions of his property. ... To draw such a distinction . . . was \u201c* * * to create in the law another of those strange anomalies which, once created, live on to haunt successive legal generations.\u201d\n(Citation omitted.) Fuller v. Housing Authority, 108 R.I. 770, 773-74, 279 A.2d 438, 49 A.L.R.3d 382 (1971). See also Kopke v. AAA Warehouse Corp., 30 Colo. App. 470, 494 P. 2d 1307 (1972); Yerly v. Jenik, 491 P.2d 980 (Colo. App. 1971); Monroe Park Apartments Corp. v. Bennett, 232 A.2d 105 (Del. 1967); Langley Park Apartments, Sec. H., Inc. v. Lund, 234 Md. 402, 199 A.2d 620 (1964); Strong v. Shefveland, 249 Minn. 59, 81 N.W.2d 247 (1957) (applying the Connecticut rule to a trailer park situation); and Massor v. Yates, 137 Ore. 569, 3 P.2d 784 (1931).\nThe foregoing cases and their progeny, were implicitly adopted by this court in McCutcheon v. United Homes Corp., 79 Wn.2d 443, 486 P.2d 1093 (1971). In McCutcheon the plaintiff rented an apartment on a month-to-month basis in a multi-dwelling complex owned by the defendant. The plaintiff was injured when she fell down an unlit flight of stairs leading from her apartment. Her rental agreement contained a general exculpatory clause relieving the owners of all liability resulting from their negligence in maintaining the common areas. In holding the exculpatory clause to be invalid, we took judicial notice of the fact that multi-family dwelling complexes have become, a major commercial enterprise, which directly affects the lives of literally thousands of people who must rely on this style of living for shelter. We explicitly stated that the landlord could not passively refrain from negligent conduct, and we further enunciated that the landlord has an \u201caffirmative obligation or duty to keep or maintain the \u2018common areas\u2019 in a reasonably safe condition for the tenant\u2019s use.\u201d McCutcheon v. United Homes Corp., supra at 447. It is important to the disposition of the instant case to recognize that McCutcheon did not limit the owner\u2019s \u201caffirmative duty\u201d with any exception for natural accumulations of snow and ice. Rather, we applied the same logic and reasoning in reaching this conclusion as other courts had applied in their adoption of a general standard of reasonable care in regard to a landlord\u2019s duty to provide safe common areas. Therefore, it is implicit that we divorced ourselves from the antiquated Massachusetts rule with our disposition in Mc-Cuteheon, and have since joined the majority of states in adhering to the modem Connecticut rule.\nAs we reaffirm our position of imposing an affirmative duty on the landlord to provide safe common areas, we must emphasize that this does not make the landlord a guarantor of the safety of those lawfully on the premises. Instead we require that he exercise reasonable care in keeping all common areas reasonably safe from hazards likely to cause injury. Accordingly, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the landlord had actual or constructive notice of the danger, and failed within a reasonable time to exercise sensible care in alleviating the situation. We do not feel that this places an insurmountable burden of \u201cvigilance and care\u201d on a landlord.\nTherefore, we hold that the trial court erred in granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, since a question of fact was presented as to whether the defendants exercised reasonable care in light of their actual notice of the situation and the surrounding circumstances. Furthermore, since we have by this opinion determined that our decision in McCutcheon implicitly overruled the cases of Oerter v. Ziegler, supra, and Schedler v. Wagner, supra, any discussion of whether this opinion is to be applied prospectively or retroactively is moot.\n\u25a0 The determination of the Court of Appeals and the judgment of the trial court are reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nHale, C.J., and Finley, Rosellini, Hamilton, Stafford, Wright, Utter, and Brachtenbach, JJ., concur."

    "Utter, J.\nJames Cherberg and his wife brought a claim based in part upon the tort of intentional interference with business expectancies arising from the willful refusal of the Joshua Green Corporation, as their landlord, to perform duties owed them under a commercial lease. A jury verdict for $42,000 was entered in favor of the Cherbergs. The Court of Appeals in Cherberg v. Peoples Nat'l Bank, 15 Wn. App. 336, 549 P.2d 46 (1976), determined that, while on the facts presented an implied duty to repair certain exterior walls did exist, the trial court erred in declining to grant the landlord's motion for a directed verdict. It held that an action for intentional interference did not lie because one cannot, as a matter of law, be guilty of an intentional tort for interfering with one's own contract. We reverse that decision.\nIn 1967 the petitioners, James and Arlene Cherberg, leased a portion of the Lewis Building on Fifth Avenue in downtown Seattle and invested some $80,000 in the establishment and operation of a restaurant business at that location. The respondent, Joshua Green Corporation, acquired the Lewis Building in February of 1972, subject to the lease of the petitioners. In April of 1972, Peoples National Bank of Washington, the owner of the property abutting the Lewis Building on the south, commenced demolition of the existing buildings on its property for the purpose of constructing a high-rise office tower. The demolition work resulted in the exposure of the south wall of the Lewis Building. It was found to be structurally unsafe and in need of substantial repairs to satisfy requirements of the City of Seattle Building Department. The demised premises here at issue were located within the Lewis Building but did not abut the south wall.\nThe lease between the parties required the lessee to make necessary repairs to maintain the demised premises, excepting the outside walls and other structural components of the building, and reserved to the lessor the use of the roof and outside walls of the building. The lease does not contain an express covenant concerning the responsibility to maintain the structural components of the building.\nUpon learning of the problems with the south wall, the lessor contacted the Cherbergs directly and through its attorneys, indicating the Green Corporation would probably elect not to repair the wall and that the City might order the building closed. The Cherbergs responded that the lessor was obligated under the lease to make repairs and that they would suffer substantial damage should their tenancy be disrupted.\nThereafter, the lessor terminated the lease and informed the Cherbergs of its intention to post the building as unsafe. The Cherbergs closed their business for approximately 1 week. An independent consultant then informed the Cherbergs that repair of the wall was in fact feasible. Petitioners reopened their business when the Green Corporation failed to actually post the building and at that time reiterated their demands to the lessor. The bank, not wishing to be delayed further in its construction plans, eventually repaired the wall at its own expense (estimated at $30,000 to $50,000).\nThis action was brought against the bank and the Green Corporation, alleging breach of the lessor's duty to repair, negligent demolition by the bank, and, that the defendants had engaged in a conspiracy to destroy petitioners' business. Undisputed evidence was presented demonstrating that there were close ties between Joshua Green III, the Green Corporation, and Peoples National Bank of Washington. The evidence disclosed the Green Corporation viewed the Lewis Building as an adequately profitable investment under the circumstances existing at the time of purchase, but that it was the Corporation's desire to regain control of the premises as soon as possible in order to demolish the existing structure on the property and erect a new building which they felt might be more profitable. Demolition of the Lewis Building during the course of the new construction would have been of substantial economic benefit both to the Green Corporation and to the bank. In early 1972 both the bank and the Green Corp\u00f3ration had requested the same agent to engage in efforts to negotiate a sale of petitioners' leasehold, in order that the Green Corporation might regain control of the premises.\nThe trial court, at the conclusion of testimony, dismissed the bank from the suit and also dismissed the negligence and conspiracy claims. Respondent's other motions pertinent to this appeal were denied. The jury was instructed that respondent was liable for damages caused by the failure to repair the outside wall. It further instructed the jury with regard to the elements of the tort of intentional interference with business expectations and that, if the jury concluded the defendant's actions were willful, damages for mental suffering, inconvenience, and discomfort would be compensable. The jury made a special finding of willful action and returned a verdict of $42,000. The only evidence of economic loss due to the temporary closure and attendant disruption of business was in the amount of $3,100.\nThe Court of Appeals held the lessor did have a duty to make repairs to the wall on the basis of a mandate so to do from competent government authority. However, it reversed and remanded, holding that the Green Corporation was entitled to a directed verdict on the claim of interference with business expectations and the assessment of damages for inconvenience, discomfort and mental distress.\nThe first issue is the rights and duties of the parties with regard to the unsafe condition of the south wall of the building. We agree with the holding of the Court of Appeals that an implied duty on the part of the lessor exists to make those repairs mandated by competent government authority where, as here, the appropriate authority determines that, in the interest of the public welfare, a defective condition of a building must be remedied. We also agree the evidence presented established that the refusal of the respondent to take action to fulfill this duty, within a reasonable time after notification from the City, breached an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment and resulted in an actionable constructive eviction. See Cherberg v. Peoples Nat'l Bank, supra at 343-45.\nIn addition, however, even absent a mandate from government authority, the lessor was under a duty to make the repairs here in question. The general rule is that a landlord has no duty to make repairs to the demised premises absent an express covenant requiring such action. Feigenbaum v. Brink, 66 Wn.2d 125, 401 P.2d 642 (1965); Conradi v. Arnold, 34 Wn.2d 730, 209 P.2d 491 (1949); Cordes v. Guy Inv. Co., 146 Wash. 143, 262 P. 131 (1927). While it is true this lease did not contain an express covenant abrogating this common-law rule, the area requiring repair was not a part of the demised premises but was an area of the building over which the landlord had expressly retained control.\nA landlord has a duty to maintain, control and preserve retained portions of the premises subject to a leasehold in a manner rendering the demised premises adequate for the tenant's use and safe for occupancy by both the tenant and his invitees. Geise v. Lee, 84 Wn.2d 866, 529 P.2d 1054 (1975); Feigenbaum v. Brink, supra; Washington Chocolate Co. v. Kent, 28 Wn.2d 448, 183 P.2d 514 (1947); Andrews v. McCutcheon, 17 Wn.2d 340, 135 P.2d 459 (1943); Le Vette v. Hardman Estate, 77 Wash. 320, 137 P. 454 (1914). Failure to fulfill this duty results in liability on the part of the lessor for injury caused thereby, Geise v. Lee, supra, and failure to fulfill this duty, by omission to repair, can in a proper case constitute an actionable constructive eviction. Washington Chocolate Co. v. Kent, supra. See generally Stoebuck, The Law Between Landlord and Tenant in Washington, 49 Wash. L. Rev. 291, 347-50 (1974).\nThe willful refusal to adequately maintain retained portions of a building so as to allow the tenant to enjoy the beneficial use of the demised portion of the building is a breach of an implied duty owed by the landlord to the tenant under Washington law. On these facts this breach of duty was sufficient to constitute an actionable constructive eviction, and provides a basis for the conclusion that the landlord was liable for any damages stemming from that breach, Washington Chocolate Co. v. Kent, supra, independent of any directive to repair issued by the City of Seattle.\nThe remaining question is whether a willful refusal on the part of a landlord to make repairs when under a duty so to do gives rise to an action in tort for intentional interference with the tenant's business expectancies with third parties. The Court of Appeals held the trial court erred in declining to grant the lessor's motion for a directed verdict on the issue of intentional interference with the lessees' business. The basis of this ruling was that the lessee should not be able to recover in tort for breach of a duty arising by virtue of a lease. The Court of Appeals also held that it was error to inform the jury it could award additional damages for inconvenience, discomfort and mental anguish if it found the lessor's actions were willful, because to do so would be to allow punitive or exemplary damages for breach of a lease.\nAs a general rule a tenant may not recover such additional damages solely on the basis of breach of such a duty. Barnes v. Bickle, 111 Wash. 133, 189 P. 998 (1920); see Stoebuck, supra at 350 n.271. On the other hand, damages for mental anguish are available upon proof of an intentional tort. See Hunsley v. Giard, 87 Wn.2d 424, 431, 553 P.2d 1096 (1976); Browning v. Slenderella Sys., 54 Wn.2d 440, 341 P.2d 859 (1959). Damages based upon discomfort and inconvenience are also available in such a situation. Carmody v. Trianon Co., 7 Wn.2d 226, 109 P.2d 560 (1941).\nThe question of whether a breach of a lease may under some circumstances also constitute a basis of liability in tort for intentional interference with business expectancies has apparently not been considered by this court. The elements of the tort of interference with business relationships are: (1) the existence of a valid contractual relationship or business expectancy; (2) knowledge of the relationship or expectancy on the part of the interferor; (3) intentional interference inducing or causing a breach or termination thereof; (4) resultant damage. Calbom v. Knudtzon, 65 Wn.2d 157, 396 P.2d 148 (1964). The existence of a valid enforceable contract is not necessary to the maintenance of the action and the possibility of a remedy in contract does not preclude it. F.D. Hill & Co. v. Wallerich, 67 Wn.2d 409, 407 P.2d 956 (1965).\nPetitioners argue evidence was presented on each of these elements sufficient to present a jury question as to liability for the tort at issue and that recovery in tort should not be denied simply because the tortious conduct may also be viewed as a breach of an implied duty under the lease. In an early case we concluded that a landlord may be held liable for the tort of interfering with his les-' see's business. Seidell v. Taylor, 86 Wash. 645, 151 P. 41 (1915). There the plaintiff maintained a bakery on premises leased from the defendant. The lessor entered the premises and instigated a \"public brawl\" which did substantial damage to the lessee's business. The lessee was allowed recovery in tort for loss of goodwill. Though the acts of the lessor rather clearly also involved a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, no mention is made in the court's opinion of the problem of allowing tort recovery for breach of a lease covenant.\nCases from other jurisdictions indicate that, in certain circumstances, a breach of contract or of a lease covenant may also give rise to liability in tort. See, e.g., Acadia, California, Ltd. v. Herbert, 54 Cal. 2d 328, 353 P.2d 294, 5 Cal. Rptr. 686 (i960)(Willful failure to supply water under a contract is both breach of contract and an intentional tort. Under the latter theory punitive damages are recoverable.); Urban v. Hartford Gas Co., 139 Conn. 301, 93 A.2d 292 (1952) (Unreasonable infliction of emotional distress arising from wrongful repossession compensable in tort.); Jones v. Kelly, 208 Cal. 251, 280 P. 942 (1929)(Act of lessor in willfully cutting off water supply to lessee constitutes constructive eviction and also states good cause of action in tort.). It appears to be the general view that, in those instances in which the conduct of the breaching party indicates a motive to destroy some interest of the adverse party, a tort action may lie and items of damage not available in contract actions will be allowed.\nIf the defendant acted merely as a contracting party (at legal liberty perhaps to breach its agreement upon payment of damage), that is one thing. But if the defendant went further, and acted with intent to inflict injury beyond that contemplated as a result of the mere breach of contract, I would hold that the contract does not grant the defaulter immunity from tort liability.\nSchisgall v. Fairchild Publications, Inc., 207 Misc. 224, 232, 137 N.Y.S.2d 312 (1955). See Peitzman v. Illmo, 141 F.2d 956 (8th Cir. 1944); Taylor v. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry., 92 F. Supp. 968 (W.D. Mo. 1950); Wampler v. Palmerton, 250 Ore. 65, 439 P.2d 601 (1968).\nA separate line of cases, supportive of the Court of Appeals decision herein, holds that, though a breach of duty under a contract or lease necessarily interferes with the injured party's business relations with third parties, the injured party is limited to an action for breach of contract and may not recover in tort for business interference. Hein v. Chrysler Corp., 45 Wn.2d 586, 277 P.2d 708 (1954); Glazer v. Chandler, 414 Pa. 304, 200 A.2d 416 (1964). See N.A. Berwin & Co. v. American Safety Razor Corp., 108 N.Y.S.2d 677 (Sup. Ct. 1951); Sax v. Sommers, 108 N.Y.S.2d 467 (Sup. Ct. 1951). In Glazer, at page 308, the rule applicable to this group of cases is set forth as follows:\n[W]here, as in this case, the allegations and evidence only disclose that defendant breached his contracts with plaintiff and that as an incidental consequence thereof plaintiff's business r nation ^hips with third parties have been affected, an action lie., only in contract for defendant's breaches, and the consequential damages recoverable, if any, may be adjudicated only in that action.\nThe distinguishing feature between the two lines of cases would seem to be whether the interference with business relations was a mere incidental consequence of the breach or a motive or purpose therefor. We have held that, in some instances, intentional interference with a business expectancy may be \"privileged\" and therefore not a basis for tort recovery. Calbom v. Knudtzon, supra; Scymanski v. Dufault, 80 Wn.2d 77, 491 P.2d 1050 (1971). A privilege to interfere may be established if the interferor's conduct is deemed justifiable, considering such factors as: the nature of the interferor's conduct; the character of the expectancy with which the conduct interferes; the relationship between the various parties; the interest sought to be advanced by the interferor; and the social desirability of protecting the expectancy or the interferor's freedom of action. Calbom v. Knudtzon, supra; Scymanski v. Dufault, supra. See also Restatement of Torts \u00a7 767 (1939).\nWhere the evidence supports the submission to the jury, as it does in this case, of an intentional breach of a lease covenant resulting from actions or motives not privileged on the basis of consideration of the factors above set forth, this can provide a basis for tort liability where it results in an interference with a valid business expectancy of another party to the lease agreement. Tort liability therefore can properly be imposed, as it is here, when the evidence adequately establishes the underlying motive for the intentional breach by the lessor was not the economic viability of the lessor's investment, in its present state, but rather was economic considerations outside the scope of the parties' obligations under their existing agreement.\nA party to a lease or contract should not be held liable in tort for a willful breach of an agreement which it is no longer economically feasible for the party to respect. As stated in the Schisgall case, a party is in such an instance at \"legal liberty\" to breach the agreement upon payment of ordinary contract damages demonstrated to have resulted from the breach. But here, the record fails to indicate that the Lewis Building would not provide the lessor with a satisfactory return if the wall had been repaired by the lessor and the lessees' rights under the lease respected. There is, instead, evidence in the record from which the jury could have inferred the lessor used the condition of the wall as a means to oust the petitioners and gain possession of the leased premises in order that the lessor might put those premises to a different and perhaps considerably more profitable use. Proof of a breach based upon such a motive demonstrates a failure to make a good faith effort to meet obligations under the lease and may give rise to liability in tort.\nIn evaluating the evidence we must assess it in view of the lessor's challenge to the denial of a motion for directed verdict on the issue of intentional interference. See Cherberg v. Peoples Nat'l Bank, 15 Wn. App. 336, 347 n.2, 549 P.2d 46 (1976). In considering such a motion for directed verdict the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and the motion should be granted, or the denial thereof reversed, only if it can be determined no evidence or reasonable inferences therefrom exist which would be sufficiently substantial to sustain a verdict for the nonmoving party. Shelby v. Keck, 85 Wn.2d 911, 541 P.2d 365 (1975); Hemmen v. Clark's Restaurant Enterprises, 72 Wn.2d 690, 434 P.2d 729 (1967); Browning v. Ward, 70 Wn.2d 45, 422 P.2d 12 (1966).\nAn examination of the testimony presented at trial when considered in a light most favorable to petitioners, indicates a number of facts from which an inference of a bad faith motive for breach might be drawn. The respondent's efforts to purchase petitioners' leasehold interest were halted almost immediately upon discovery of the structural defect in the wall. Some of respondent's conduct during negotiations could be argued to be an effort to intimidate the petitioners in such a way as to force abandonment of their position. The respondent's assertion that it would be posting the building as unsafe, followed by the failure to do so once the petitioners closed their business, coupled with the evidence that repair of the wall was feasible and was in fact accomplished at considerably lower cost than the lessor's original estimates, is also damaging to the lessor. The lessees could also argue that the respondent showed an unusual lack of concern for the effect of demolition and construction adjacent to and underneath the Lewis Building upon the petitioners' business, and failed to use its best efforts to minimize the disruption to the lessees' business.\nOur examination of the record indicates that evidence was presented to the jury sufficient to provide a basis for liability for the tort of intentional interference with business expectancies. The motion for a directed verdict on that issue was therefore properly denied. The record also contains testimony from several witnesses about the effect of respondent's conduct on the petitioners and the mental distress, inconvenience, and discomfort suffered by the petitioners as a result of that conduct. The damages awarded are not so disproportionate to the injuries proven as to be indicative of passion or prejudice and we will therefore not disturb the jury verdict. Rasor v. Retail Credit Co., 87 Wn.2d 516, 554 P.2d 10"

    "Rosellini, J.\nThis is an appeal from a judgment awarding damages for flooding of the plaintiffs\u2019 basement by reason of the defendant\u2019s neglect. The action was tried to the court, and no error has been assigned to any of the court\u2019s findings.\nRule on Appeal 43, 34A Wn. (2d) 47, as amended, effective January 2, 1953, provides in part:\n\u201cIn appeals from all actions at law or in equity tried to the court without a jury, the findings of fact made by the court will be accepted as the established facts in the case unless error is assigned thereto.\u201d\nThis rule has been followed without exception.

(2d) 1046.\nThe facts found by the court are as follows: The property of the plaintiffs, a dwelling house with a partial basement, located at 2002 west Pioneer, Puyallup, was flooded on December 11, 1955, by water coming through a window or windows from floodwater which had covered the yard to a considerable depth. The water rose in the basement to and above the lower level of the floor joists of the house, causing the joists to become saturated with water and the framework of the house to become damaged by water.\nThe flooding and damage to the plaintiffs\u2019 property were caused by the failure of the defendant to install pumps of sufficient capacity at its pumping station on west Pioneer avenue and the failure of the city to provide an adequate by-pass to Clarks Creek in event of pump failure at the station.\nAs a direct and proximate result of the flood, plaintiffs incurred the following damage: Furnace repair and replacement in the sum of $250, and permanent warping and damage to the floor joists and building in the sum of $300, a total damage of $550.\nOn January 5, 1956, the plaintiffs caused their written claim for damages to be served upon the defendant.\nJudgment for the plaintiffs was entered accordingly.\nThere is no contention that the judgment is not supported by the findings. The only errors assigned pertain to the admission of certain evidence regarding the amount of damages and the probative value of that evidence. These matters inhere in the findings, which cannot be disturbed.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nHill, C. J., Donworth, Foster, and Hunter, JJ., concur."

    "Utter, J.\nIn this case, we once again consider the constitutionality of portions of the City of Seattle\u2019s Residential Housing Inspection Program (RHIP). In Margola Assocs. v. Seattle, 121 Wn.2d 625, 854 P.2d 23 (1993), we were confronted with a number of constitutional challenges to the funding provisions of the RHIP. We rejected most of these challenges, including those based on taking without just compensation, substantive due process, equal protection, and the impairment of contracts. Margola, 121 Wn.2d at 642-54. We remanded the case for further proceedings, however, because a material question of fact persisted as to whether the funding provisions were an impermissible tax or a permissible fee. Margola, 121 Wn.2d at 640-41.\nHere, we are faced with a constitutional challenge to the manner in which Seattle has implemented the RHIP. A number of Seattle landowners assert that \"inspection warrants\u201d issued by a superior court in implementation of the RHIP violate the fourth amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 7 of the Washington State Constitution. They argue the warrants are unconstitutional because they were issued without probable cause to believe the buildings to be searched were in violation of the pertinent building and housing codes.\nWe hold that under Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7, the warrants must be quashed.\nI\nAs we noted in Marg\u00f3la, Seattle previously enforced its building and housing codes, including the Building Code, the Electrical Code, the Housing Code, etc. (collectively, \"the housing codes\u201d), solely on a complaint and probable cause basis. 121 Wn.2d at 631-32. That is, the City\u2019s Department of Construction and Land Use (DCLU) would investigate potential violations of the housing codes only when there was either a complaint of a violation or if DCLU had other evidence constituting probable cause to believe a violation had occurred.\nIn 1986, DCLU concluded the complaint-based system was inadequate and that some form of \"proactive\u201d enforcement program was needed. The agency therefore proposed to the Seattle City Council that research be done in the direction of formulating such a program. In 1987, the Seattle city council accepted DCLU\u2019s recommendation, determining that \"housing code enforcement on a complaint basis frequently delays City intervention until structures have become seriously deteriorated.\u201d Seattle City Ordinance 113531 (July 30, 1987). The city council therefore directed DCLU to develop and implement a \"demonstration program\u201d involving proactive enforcement, in which inspections would be based on objective factors such as building size, age, and geographic location rather than on probable cause. Ordinance 113531, \u00a71.\nThe demonstration program operated from 1987 through the end of 1988. Three hundred fifty apartment buildings were chosen at random from the City\u2019s housing stock and inspected for housing violations. DCLU then compiled the data from the inspections. DCLU reported to the city council that while 78 percent of the 350 buildings inspected had some sort of housing code violation, only a \"small percentage\u201d had \"serious\u201d code violations. Clerk\u2019s Papers, at 197. However, DCLU also reported that over 80 percent of the buildings with violations had not been the subject of complaints under the previous system. Clerk\u2019s Papers, at 197. In light of the findings of the demonstration program, DCLU recommended to the city council some sort of permanent proactive enforcement program be adopted.\nThe city council therefore directed the agency by resolution to \"design and propose a proactive enforcement program\u201d. Seattle City Resolution 28046 (Sept. 18, 1989). The council indicated that any proposed program should employ computer modeling of objective factors in order to identify the worst \"30 percent\u201d of the City\u2019s multifamily apartment buildings for inspection. Resolution 28046. Pursuant to Resolution 28046, DCLU developed the RHIP.\nUnfortunately, the precise characteristics of the RHIP are not contained within a single legislative or administrative document; instead, the details of the RHIP must be gleaned from the various affidavits and declarations which are present in the record. In brief, the RHIP is a \"predictive model\u201d inspection program, whereby DCLU chooses to inspect buildings on the basis of certain objective factors associated with those buildings rather than on specific information of a violation of the housing codes. The \"predictive model\u201d which is the source of the RHIP\u2019s inspection decisions was developed by a private economics consultant. The consultant employed multiple regression analysis, a common statistical tool, to identify correlations between objective factors, like a building\u2019s age, and likelihood of serious code violations. Based on the data from the demonstration program, he ultimately identified three objective factors which had a statistically significant relationship to the likelihood of violations: building age, assessed value per unit, and number of code violations in the past 5 years. Using these three factors as predictors, the consultant selected the 30 percent of Seattle\u2019s multifamily apartment buildings with the highest likelihood of serious code violations.\nDCLU implemented an inspection program with respect to the buildings on the 30 percent list through a system of owner notification, tenant consent, and, finally, search warrants. According to the official who manages the RHIP, apartment building owners are notified as a \"matter of courtesy\u201d. Clerk\u2019s Papers, at 342. A letter is sent to each of the affected tenants explaining the RHIP and requesting the tenant\u2019s consent to inspect. If the tenant refuses entry to the city\u2019s inspectors, a search warrant is sought ex parte. It is unclear from the record whether notice of the warrant proceeding is provided to the nonconsenting tenant. One tenant has indicated he received no notice, Clerk\u2019s Papers, at 1388, while another was informed a warrant would be sought, though not on what date or in what forum, Clerk\u2019s Papers, at 1173.\nResolution 28046 had directed DCLU to \"design and propose\u201d a proactive inspection program. While this language might imply the city council intended to review the RHIP before its implementation and pass an authorizing ordinance, no ordinance has been issued enacting the RHIP. However, the council has taken a number of actions indicating its support for DCLU and the program. As part of its budget ordinance for 1990, the council approved funds for the implementation of the RHIP. See ordinance 114800 (Dec. 1, 1989) and Clerk\u2019s Papers, at 250. The council also enacted an ordinance providing civil penalties for persons who interfered with RHIP inspections. Ordinance 116315 (Aug. 21, 1992). And finally, on July 13,1992, the council issued a resolution, in which the mayor \"concurred\u201d, recognizing that warrants might be necessary in order to carry out the RHIP. Resolution 28562 (July 13, 1992).\nOn April 2, 1991, prior to seeking any warrants, Seattle filed a class action in superior court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the RHIP was valid under both the Fourth Amendment and Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7. The complaint named a number of the appellants, including James and Ann. Mc-Cready, George Lott, and Marv Kaercher, as representatives of the class of \"owners of multi-family rental housing\u201d. Clerk\u2019s Papers, at 1564. It also named a number of individuals, including Siobhan Stewart, Greg Marshall, and Kels Koch, as representatives of the class of \"all tenants living in multi-family housing\u201d. Clerk\u2019s Papers, at 1564.\nSeattle\u2019s attempts to carry its declaratory judgment complaint forward as a class action suit were rebuffed, however, when the superior court denied certification of the owner and tenant classes. Seattle then continued its action with the former class representatives as defendants, moved for summary judgment on the constitutional issues, and presented the superior court with four specific warrant applications. The warrant applications applied to two apartments at 1737 Belmont Avenue, a building co-owned by Kaercher, an apartment at 1729 Boylston Avenue, and an apartment at 924 16th Avenue, a building owned by the McCreadys.\nAccording to declarations attached to the warrant applications, Seattle had requested consent to inspect from each of the tenants occupying the apartments for which warrants were sought and consent had been refused in each case. Clerk\u2019s Papers, at 343-44, 353-55. The declarations also described the RHIP in some detail, including the demonstration program which provided the data on which the RHIP was based. Based on these warrant applications and other documents which were before the superior court as a consequence of the declaratory judgment action, the court issued the four requested search warrants on July 17, 1992. The court concluded that while the apartment building owners did have standing to challenge the RHIP, the program was constitutional under both the Fourth Amendment and Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7.\nEach warrant directed representatives of DCLU to inspect the named apartments \"during the daylight hours between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on a business day (Monday through Friday).\u201d See, e.g., Clerk\u2019s Papers, at 1270. The warrants further directed: \"inspection shall be strictly limited to those places where 0 violations of the Housing and Building Maintenance Code might reasonably be found.\u201d See, e.g., Clerk\u2019s Papers, at 1270.\nThe defendants appealed the warrants to this court on July 20. Clerk\u2019s Papers, at 1251-52. In conjunction with that appeal, the defendants moved for an emergency stay of the warrants pending review. On July 23, the court commissioner granted the emergency stay with respect to only three of the four warrants, since neither the owner nor the tenant at 1729 Boylston challenged the warrant with respect to that property. After a further determination by the commissioner that the case was properly appealable, this court accepted direct review.\nII\nThis case requires us to consider, construe, and apply the provision of our state fundamental law which provides that \"[n]o person shall be disturbed in his private affairs, or his home invaded, without authority of law.\u201d Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7. It is by now commonplace to observe Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7 provides protections for the citizens of Washington which are qualitatively different from, and in some cases broader than, those provided by the Fourth Amendment. See, e.g., Seattle v. Mesiani, 110 Wn.2d 454, 456, 755 P.2d 775 (1988); State v. Gunwall, 106 Wn.2d 54, 65, 720 P.2d 808, 76 A.L.R.4th 517 (1986); State v. Stroud, 106 Wn.2d 144, 148, 720 P.2d 436 (1986).\nThe import of Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7 in any given context is not established merely by describing the differences between that provision and the Fourth or Fifth Amendments to the federal constitution. Rather, the focus is on whether the unique characteristics of the state constitutional provision and its prior interpretations actually compel a particular result. See First Covenant Church v. Seattle, 120 Wn.2d 203, 234-35, 840 P.2d 174 (1992) (Utter, J., concurring); Stroud, 106 Wn.2d at 158 (Durham, J., concurring in result). It was for this purpose, and for the purpose of assisting counsel in developing state constitutional arguments, that we originally established the familiar six nonexclusive Gunwall factors, State v. Boland, 115 Wn.2d 571, 575, 800 P.2d 1112 (1990), and then exercised our discretion to refuse to consider state constitutional claims \"neither timely nor sufficiently argued by the parties\u201d, State v. Wethered, 110 Wn.2d 466, 472, 755 P.2d 797 (1988), when parties inadequately argued the critical Gunwall factors to the court. See also Guimont v. Clarke, 121 Wn.2d 586, 604, 854 P.2d 1 (1993); In re A,B,C,D,E, 121 Wn.2d 80, 90 n.6, 847 P.2d 455 (1993); State v. Reding, 119 Wn.2d 685, 696, 835 P.2d 1019 (1992). In this case, the extensive briefing of the parties and amicus on the Const. art*. 1, \u00a7 7 issue clearly meets the demands of Gunwall and Wethered.\nThe solution to this case is found in the unique characteristics of Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7, particularly its language and preexisting state case and statutory law.\nAppellants and amicus present two arguments that the search warrants violate Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7. They first contend the RHIP was not properly promulgated by Seattle since DCLU\u2019s authority to develop the program was contained only in a \"resolution\u201d and not in an \"ordinance\u201d, in violation of the Seattle City Charter. Second, they urge this court to reject the Fourth Amendment standards for administrative inspection established by the United States Supreme Court in Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 18 L. Ed. 2d 930, 87 S. Ct. 1727 (1967), and See v. Seattle, 387 U.S. 541, 18 L. Ed. 2d 943, 87 S. Ct. 1737 (1967), and impose the traditional criminal law test of probable cause on administrative search warrants as a matter of state constitutional law.\nWe appreciate the parties\u2019 desire to attain a definitive ruling from this court on the status of administrative search warrants in Washington, but we find that such a ruling is unnecessary to the resolution of this case. It is unnecessary due to an issue which presents itself to us with \"disquieting obtrusiveness\u201d upon our examination of the record. Wiles v. Department of Labor & Indus., 34 Wn.2d 714, 719, 209 P.2d 462 (1949). That issue is the constitutional authority of a superior court to issue these search warrants at all in the absence of a specific authorizing statute or court rule. We deemed this issue to be of sufficient importance that we requested additional briefing from the parties pursuant to RAP 12.1(b).\nOrdinarily, the failure of the parties to raise an issue would preclude its examination at this stage. However, this court has frequently recognized it is not constrained by the issues as framed by the parties if the parties ignore a constitutional mandate, a statutory commandment, or an established precedent. See Maynard Inv. Co. v. McCann, 77 Wn.2d 616, 623, 465 P.2d 657 (1970) (court raising applicability of statute sua sponte); Obert v. Environmental Research & Dev. Corp., 112 Wn.2d 323, 333-34, 771 P.2d 340 (1989) (same); State v. Danforth, 97 Wn.2d 255, 257, 643 P.2d 882 (1982) (same). This court has the inherent discretionary authority to reach issues not briefed by the parties if those issues are necessary for decision. See Hanson v. Snohomish, 121 Wn.2d 552, 557, 852 P.2d 295 (1993); Alverado v. WPPSS, 111 Wn.2d 424, 429, 759 P.2d 427 (1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1004 (1989); see also RAP 12.1(b) (describing procedure by which courts may obtain additional briefing on issues not addressed by the parties).\nThe issue is one which implicates constitutional rights. Cf. State v. McCullum, 98 Wn.2d 484, 487, 656 P.2d 1064 (1983). To uphold the warrants in this proceeding without addressing the question of the magistrate\u2019s authority to issue those warrants would be to potentially countenance a serious governmental intrusion in contravention of the mandate of Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7. Ignoring the issue at this stage could lead to difficult implementation problems below. Regardless of our decision on the level of suspicion necessary to uphold a search warrant under Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7, the question of the issuing magistrate\u2019s authority would remain open and leave this area of the law in continuing uncertainty. In addition, the question is a purely legal one. Among the reasons courts often adduce for declining to address issues not properly briefed is the absence of a complete factual record. See, e.g., John Doe v. Puget Sound Blood Ctr., 117 Wn.2d 772, 784-85, 819 P.2d 370 (1991). When the issue is entirely legal, that concern does not exist. The issue is also not one which was raised by this court sua sponte following argument. Instead, we requested the parties to provide briefing and argument on the question pursuant to RAP 12.1(b). The parties have therefore had an opportunity to present their positions. For these reasons, we deem the question of the superior court\u2019s authority to issue these warrants, consistent with Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7, to be properly before us for decision.\nIll\nConst. art. 1, \u00a7 7 breaks down into two basic components: the disturbance of a person\u2019s \"private affairs\u201d or the invasion of his or her home, which triggers the protection of the section; and the requirement that \"authority of law\u201d justify the governmental disturbance or invasion. The language of Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7, strikingly divergent from the Fourth Amendment, appears to be derived from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 29 L. Ed. 746, 6 S. Ct. 524 (1886). See Sanford E. Pitler, Comment, The Origin and Development of Washington\u2019s Independent Exclusionary Rule: Constitutional Right and Constitutionally Compelled Remedy, 61 Wash. L. Rev. 459, 521-22 (1986). There, the Court stated that the protective mantle of the constitution extended to \"all invasions on the part of the government and its employ\u00e9s of the sanctity of a man\u2019s home and the privacies of life.\u201d Boyd, 116 U.S. at 630. See also In re Pacific Ry. Comm\u2019n, 32 F. 241, 251 (N.D. Cal. 1887). A disturbance of a person\u2019s private affairs generally occurs when the government intrudes upon \"those privacy interests which citizens of this state have held, and should be entitled to hold, safe from government trespass\u201d. State v. Boland, 115 Wn.2d 571, 577, 800 P.2d 1112 (1990) (quoting State v. Myrick, 102 Wn.2d 506, 510-11, 688 P.2d 151 (1984)). The assessment of whether a cognizable privacy interest exists under Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7 is thus not merely an inquiry into a person\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy but is rather an examination of whether the expectation is one which a citizen of this state should be entitled to hold. Many of the cases which comprise our Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7 jurisprudence have involved consideration of whether a particular governmental activity disturbed or intruded upon legitimate entitlements of privacy under Washington law. See, e.g., State v. Salinas, 119 Wn.2d 192,197-98, 829 Wn.2d 1068 (1992) (private conversations where one party consents to electronic recording of the conversation); State v. Boland, supra (garbage placed curbside for collection); State v. Gunwall, 106 Wn.2d 54, 720 P.2d 808, 76 A.L.R.4th 517 (1986) (information derived from a pen register); State v. Myrick, supra (aerial surveillance of property).\nSeattle does not claim, nor could it, that a nonconsensual inspection of residential apartments is not a disturbance of \"private affairs\u201d under Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7. Moreover, it does not claim, nor could it, that the inspection of such apartments does not trigger Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7 because this challenge to the validity of the inspections is being brought by the owners of the apartment buildings rather than by the occupants of the apartments. The only question under Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7 is therefore whether there exists adequate \"authority of law\u201d to justify the manifest disturbance of appellants\u2019 private affairs represented by the issuance and potential execution of these warrants.\nWe have in the past recognized that the authority of law for a particular governmental disturbance of a person\u2019s private affairs may be provided by a search warrant. See Gunwall, 106 Wn.2d at 68-69; see also Tacoma v. Houston, 27 Wn.2d 215, 221, 177 P.2d 886 (1947). Since Seattle has here obtained warrants for the search of appellants\u2019 apartment buildings from a superior court, this would appear to provide the authority of law necessary to justify Seattle\u2019s intrusion into appellants\u2019 private affairs.\nThe warrant requirement, however, cannot be satisfied merely by the existence of a document which is labeled a warrant; instead, Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7 demands the existence of a valid warrant. See State v. Myers, 117 Wn.2d 332, 337, 815 P.2d 761 (1991) (describing a number of art"

    "Weaver, J.\nThis is an appeal from an order granting plaintiff a new trial after a jury verdict in favor of defendant. The action was one for damages resulting from the flooding of plaintiff\u2019s property. The new trial was granted solely upon the ground that the court erred in giving a certain instruction relating to contributory negligence.\nThe appellant contends the instruction was a proper one. Respondent argues that it was improper, but that, if we hold the instruction to have been proper, then we\n\u201c. . . may pass upon and determine all the questions of law involved in the cause presented upon such appeal and necessary to the final determination of the cause. Respondent may present and urge claimed errors by the trial court in instructions and rulings which, if repeated on a new trial, would constitute prejudicial error.\u201d 34A Wn. (2d) 23, Rule 16, Rules on Appeal.\nPursuant to this rule, respondent urges that the trial court erred in giving certain additional instructions and in refusing to submit to the jury certain requested instructions.\nIn Ellefsen v. Wilt, 36 Wn. (2d) 56, 217 P. (2d) 318, we said:\n\u201cWe have held in a long line of cases, beginning at least as early as Davis v. Gilliam, 14 Wash. 206, 44 Pac. 119, that when no other verdict than that rendered by the jury could be permitted to stand, it is unnecessary to determine whether the trial court erred in giving or refusing to give an instruction, [citing cases]\n\u201cAnother long line of cases based on the same reasoning holds that where no other verdict than that rendered by the jury could be permitted to stand, errors in instructions given or refused are not material and cannot be made the basis for granting a new trial. A number of these cases are cited in Sellman v. Hess, 15 Wn. (2d) 310, 130 P. (2d) 688.\u201d (Italics ours.) (p. 57)\nBefore we can examine the propriety and correctness of the instruction relating to contributory negligence and the other instructions given and refused to which complaint is directed, we must, of necessity, determine whether a verdict other than the verdict rendered by the jury could be permitted to stand. We will not needlessly discuss multiple assignments of error relating to instructions, when, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party requesting a new trial, it cannot be said that the jury, under proper instructions, could have brought in any other verdict than that which it rendered.\nSpecifically, we must first concern ourselves with the question of the possible primary negligence of the city, for it would be idle to decide questions of contributory negligence as included in the instructions if the evidence does not disclose primary negligence. If the evidence was insufficient to justify a verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor, it was error for the trial court to award a new trial.\nPlaintiff\u2019s property is located in the southern portion of a natural watershed within the city limits of Seattle. Although its boundaries vary according to topography, generally the watershed is bounded on the north by east 85th street; on the east by 50th avenue N. E.; on the south by Union Bay; and on the west by 34th avenue N. E. It contains approximately eight hundred twenty acres. The east, north, and west limits slope toward its center. To drain this area of water flowing toward its center from its natural slopes, a natural stream flowed from the north end of the watershed in a southerly direction, eventually emptying into Union Bay.\nThe stream ran in an open channel. When it intersected streets it was carried, for many years, by thirty-six-inch covered culverts or pipes, but was otherwise permitted to flow in its natural bed.\nIn the southern portion of the drainage area, 40th avenue N. E. (running north and south) intersects east 55th street (running east and west), at right angles. Since this intersection is an important one for the purpose of this case, we will, for the sake of brevity, hereafter refer to it as \u201c40-55.\u201d This intersection is approximately two thousand feet in a straight line from the point where the stream entered plaintiff\u2019s property. The stream, running in a southeasterly direction, was carried under \u201c40-55\u201d by a thirty-six-inch pipe. Numerous exhibits show it as being under the northeast side of the intersection. From there it ran through several properties, under a railroad right of way and Sandpoint way near east 50th street by means of thirty-six-inch pipes, and, as an open stream, entered the east side of the unimproved property later purchased by plaintiff, flowing in a southwesterly direction for about three hundred feet and .then turned slightly to the right, leaving the property at a point on 40th avenue N. E.\nWe now turn to two situations described with much detail in the evidence: first, the sewage and drainage system of the area prior to September, 1948, the date the city commenced revamping the sewage and drainage system; and second, what the city did between that date and February 10, 1949, the date plaintiff\u2019s property was first flooded; for we are searching the record in order to find facts constituting actionable negligence on the part of defendant city.\nPrior to 1931, all natural drainage of the area was handled by the stream, sometimes described as a rivulet or small creek. In 1931, the city installed some combination storm and sanitary sewer lines to handle the sewage and drain a portion of the storm water from the area. These lines funneled the sewage and some of the storm waters into the intersection at \u201c40-55.\u201d This intersection was the lowest point in the watershed where water could enter the trunk sewer by gravity. At that point, the stream became a part of the sewage system of the city in a rather complex manner.\nThe stream was carried under the intersection through a thirty-six-inch pipe which came out near the southeast corner of the intersection, from which point the open stream bed carried it.\nAt or near the intersection were four manholes. Under each was a collection chamber. Just east of the intersection there was an overflow manhole into which a thirty-inch sewer line from .the east emptied. From that manhole a twelve-inch line ran into a manhole near the south line of the intersection. From the east manhole there was also an overflow pipe running into the thirty-six-inch culvert which carried the stream. When the twelve-inch line could not handle the flow, a weir diverted the excess into the overflow pipe and thence to the stream.\nJust east of the intersection there was a manhole serving an eight-inch sewer. From this manhole an eight-inch line ran to the south manhole.\nThe drainage area to the west was served by a twenty-one-inch sewer which ran into a manhole on the west side of the intersection. This manhole was so constructed that by means of a weir, a ten-inch pipe would conduct the combined sewage and drainage to the south manhole. If the flow into the west manhole became more than the capacity of the ten-inch pipe, the weir diverted the excess to a twenty-one-inch pipe which crossed the intersection from the west in a southeasterly direction to the stream.\nThe fourth manhole was, of course, the south one. In addition to the lines already described as emptying into it, it received drainage from a twelve-inch sewer coming from the north under 40th avenue N. E. The south manhole was the entrance to the 40th avenue N. E. main trunk twenty-four-inch sewer. If there was an overflow from the south manhole, it too returned to the stream.\nThe evidence shows the convergence, at the south manhole, of pipes capable of carrying forty-two inches of sanitary sewage and drainage which drains into a twenty-four-inch trunk sewer. Any time the twenty-four-inch sewer was carrying its capacity, all additional water was returned to the stream. Or, in other words, for almost twenty years the stream was an integral part of the sewer system of this particular drainage area and carried all of the drainage north of east 55th street except that which was collected by the existing catch.basins and sewer lines and channeled through the intersection at \u201c40-55\u201d into the twenty-four-inch trunk sewer. The stream, in its natural state below the intersection, was at all times sufficient to accommodate all sewage and drainage returned to the stream. There was no evidence presented that the stream ever overflowed its banks under this condition.\nThis was the condition which existed when plaintiff\u2019s predecessor acquired its property in 1946. It is bounded on the west by 40th avenue N. E., diagonally on the north by Sandpoint way, on the south by east 45th street, and on the east by some vacant property to the north and by private homes to the south. The stream crossed the property as we have heretofore described.\nIn 1947, plaintiff decided to improve the property by building garden-type apartment buildings thereon. Along with problems of future sewering, and a proposed paved public street through the property (which eventually was built over a part of the stream after it had been filled in by plaintiff), plaintiff\u2019s officers were concerned about what could be done with the stream. Plaintiff\u2019s officers and agents held two conferences with the city engineer. The trial court received statements made by the city engineer, not as evidence of defendant\u2019s negligence, but as bearing upon the narrower issue of whether, in following the advice of the city engineer, plaintiff\u2019s agents had used due care. The statements were, in the words of the trial court, \u201cjust an opinion of some citizen.\u201d What the city engineer advised will be taken by us as what any engineer consulted by plaintiff might have advised.\nThe city engineer stated that plans were completed for the drainage of the entire area, and that, by the time plaintiff had finished construction, or had gotten under way with construction, the stream would not be a problem. He recommended, however, \u201cfor your own satisfaction,\u201d that a twelve-inch pipe be laid to carry the stream across plaintiff\u2019s property, stating that it would be sufficient to handle the flow of the stream.\nPlaintiff commenced construction of its project in October, 1947. Shortly after the second conference with the city engineer, plaintiff laid a fifteen-inch concrete culvert in the open stream bed across its property. At its portal the stream bed was filled, in to a depth of four or five feet in order to create a \u201chead.\u201d The balance of the creek bed was filled in in March, 1948, and thereafter as the construction progressed. The flow of the stream at that time was equal to the capacity of a six or eight-inch pipe. For the first three hundred feet,' the fifteen-inch pipe sloped approximately three per cent. Where the stream changed course on plaintiff\u2019s property, a manhole was installed. The stream continued from the manhole through the fifteen-inch pipe laid on a one per cent grade. During the floods which followed, water backed up in this manhole to a depth of six or seven feet. Where plaintiff\u2019s fifteen-inch pipe left its property on a one per cent grade, the city continued it on a five per cent slope across 40th avenue N. E. After the floods, plaintiff asked the city to remove this extension. It did so, but the water level at the intake of the fifteen-inch pipe remained the same.\nIn the fall of 1948, the city began construction of the \u201c40th Avenue N. E. Trunk and Lateral Sewer System\u201d which would drain the entire area and, when completed, eliminate .the stream. Its complete description is complicated, and we describe only so much of it as bears upon the problem here.\nWhen completed, the intersection at \u201c40-55\u201d was to be served by a fifty-four-inch pipe which would eliminate the necessity of the overflow pipes from the manholes. To accomplish this, the city built a diversion and overflow chamber immediately south of the intersection. The two existing overflow manholes were connected to it. North of the chamber a thirty-six-inch sewer was started but had been connected with only a few houses at the time in question. This chamber was connected with a manhole to the existing twenty-four-inch sewer. The new fifty-four-inch sewer had not yet reached the chamber from the south. Temporarily, it was necessary to provide for possible overflow from the chamber, just as it was necessary to return water to the stream from the manholes prior to construction of the chamber.\nDuring construction, the city did exactly what it had always done. It returned to the stream the water and sewage which was beyond the capacity of the original twenty-four-inch pipe. At a time when no water was present, the city dug a ditch from the outlet of the new overflow chamber to the stream. In the chamber was a weir. When the capacity of the twenty-four-inch sewer was reached, the weir directed the excess to the ditch, which, in turn, returned the water to the stream. The weir and ditch took the place of the overflow and return system as it existed from the manholes. The ditch was a precautionary device, in the event of heavy rains, much the same as the pipes which emptied into the stream had been precautionary. They prevented the sewers above 55th street from overflowing. After this change was made, and prior to completion of the fifty-four-inch sewer from the south, the stream continued to be called upon to carry the same burden as before, the only difference being that the overflow waters returned to it a short distance below the intersection, instead of at the intersection.\nThe United States department of commerce monthly climatological summary for February, 1949, introduced by plaintiff, discloses some interesting facts. Mean temperature was below normal. It was the coldest February since 1936. There was 6.82 inches of precipitation. Normal for the month was 3.89 inches. Only two prior Februarys since 1891 had more: 8.10 inches in 1902, and 6.85 inches in 1916. In addition, 10.4 inches of snow fell, when 3.3 inches was normal. This was the heaviest February precipitation since the system was installed in 1931.\nPlaintiff\u2019s building designated as number 10 was in the northeast portion of its property below the mouth of the fifteen-inch pipe installed by plaintiff in the creek bed.\nOn February 9th and February 10th, 1.44 inches of rain fell, as well as .06 inches of snow. Water backed up at the mouth of plaintiff\u2019s fifteen-inch pipe, the point at which plaintiff had filled in to create a \u201chead,\u201d and inundated the basement of building number 10, which housed the central heating plant. For a few days, there was only a trace of precipitation, and then, on February 15th and February 16th, 1.42 inches of rain fell. The basement and heating plant were again flooded. On February 19th, 3.3 inches of snow fell. It rained continuously for twenty-four hours on February 21st, with a total precipitation of 1.89 inches. The next day, .55 inches of rain was added, for a two-day total of 2.44 inches. Needless to say, a further outrage was visited on the oft-violated basement of building number 10. It was for the damage thus suffered that plaintiff sued.\nActionable negligence consists of a duty, its breach, and a resulting injury. Christensen v. Weyerhaeuser Timber Co., 16 Wn. (2d) 424, 133 P. (2d) 797; McCoy v. Courtney, 25 Wn. (2d) 956, 172 P. (2d) 596, 170 A. L. R. 603. If the city owed or breached no duty to plaintiff, it was not guilty of negligence toward it. Before a municipality is liable for causing an injury, it must appear that some duty, incumbent upon it to perform, has been neglected or has been improperly discharged.\nA city is hable for flooding property required to be connected to its sewers, which, though sufficient when constructed, have become insufficient to carry off the sewage and drainage conducted into them. Boyer v. Tacoma, 156 Wash. 280, 286 Pac. 659, 70 A. L. R. 1342; Tombari v. Spokane, 197 Wash. 207, 84 P. (2d) 678. We find no fault with this rule. It is simply inapplicable here. Plaintiff was not required to, and did not, connect its sewers to the stream. Nor is there any evidence that the stream was, in its natural condition, or as supplemented by the sewer system in 1931, insufficient as a sewer of the city to carry off sewage and surface water.\nSeveral of plaintiff\u2019s theories sift down to the claim that a peculiar responsibility was cast upon the city by reason of using the stream as a part of its sewage system. However, in the absence of statute to the contrary, a municipality has the right to discharge its sewers into a stream flowing within its limits, and to use it as a portion of its drainage system, so long as no more water is put into the stream than it could accommodate in its natural condition. 11 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d ed.) 226, \u00a7 31.27; 18 Id. 529, \u00a7 53.136.\nIt is clear from the evidence that the ratio of sewage volume to drainage was small; and that very little more sewage was drained into the system in February, 1949, than had been drained into it at any time during the previous two years, during part of which time the fifteen-inch pipe was in use by plaintiff.\nIn O\u2019Donnell v. Syracuse, 184 N. Y. 1, 76 N. E. 738, plaintiff claimed that her property, which was down stream from defendant, was flooded after a heavy rain because defendant emptied its sewers into the stream. In holding that defendant was not liable, the court said:\n\u201cThe plaintiff and the other citizens affected by the flood were no worse off than they would have been if the creek had not been used at all for sewerage purposes, except for the incidental deposit of the sewage matter. The drainage of sewers into the channel, however, did not cause the flood, although, naturally, contributing to the volume of the stream. The flood was an extraordinary and an unusual one, resulting from the natural causes of the action of the elements and of the lay of the land.\u201d (p. 16)\nPlaintiff argues that, by doing additional paving and surfacing north of 55th street, as well as diverting the ditch into the stream, the city breached its duty to plaintiff, in that the flow of the stream was artificially accelerated and incidentally increased. It is well settled that the flow of surface water along natural drains may be hastened or incidentally increased by artificial means, so long as the water is not ultimately diverted from its natural flow onto the property of another. Annotations 5 A. L. R. 1530; Annotations 36 A. L. R. 1463. A city is not negligent if it increases the flow of water through a natural drainway, due to streets and catchbasins, unless the drainage is increased beyond the capacity of the watercourse in its natural condition. In Bowling Green v. Stevens, 205 Ky. 161, 265 S. W. 495, the court said:\n\u201cThe argument is that the new buildings and streets had the effect of causing to flow into the drain a quantity of water that would have been absorbed by the natural surface of the land. Manifestly, the rights of the lower proprietor are subject to the right of the upper proprietor to use his land in the natural and ordinary way, so long as there is no substantial change in the natural flow of the water. Hence, though the upper proprietor has no right to open or remove natural barriers and turn on lower lands surface water which would not otherwise flow in that direction, he has the right, even by ditches and drains, to drain the surface water from his own land into the channels which nature has provided, even though the quantity of water thrown upon the lower lands is thereby increased. [Citing cases.] The rule has been applied in favor of a municipal corporation and its right to carry off surface water in order to improve the streets and render its territory more suitable for building purposes has been recognized.\u201d (p. 162)\nThere is no evidence that the city was negligent in accelerating drainage by the installation of street paving north of 55th street, and hence it did not violate the rule we have heretofore announced in Bonthuis v"

    "Utter, J.\n\u2014 The City of Seattle appeals from a ruling by the trial court awarding damages to John P. King and his wife. The damages were for the City\u2019s alleged intentional and wrongful refusal to issue street use and building permits to the Kings.\nThe City contends that its acts are immune from liability because they involve the erroneous exercise of discretion and, even if no immunity exists, that its acts were not the proximate cause of the Kings\u2019 damages. We find no immunity under the facts of this case, but conclude there is no showing that the City\u2019s acts were the proximate cause of the Kings\u2019 damages.\nThe Kings were contract purchasers of lots submerged in Lake Union in Seattle. The lots abut Fairview Avenue East which is itself partially submerged along the edge of the lake where it adjoins the lot boundaries. The Kings first applied for a building permit in January 1969 to construct an apartment building on the lots. They were unable to obtain a lease from the State of Washington for adjoining state land which would have been necessary to meet the zoning requirements for construction of an apartment building. Their failure to obtain the leased land resulted in denial of the building permit.\nIn March of 1970 the Kings applied for a building permit to enable them to construct an office building on the same lots.\" This building did not require the use of additional land. A condition precedent to the granting of the building permit, however, was the issuance of a street use permit by the Board of Public Works, an agency of the City. The Board of Public Works denied the application for the street use permit at that time, based upon their judgment that a street use permit might conflict with a pending local improvement district plan, not yet enacted by ordinance. The building department denied the building permit at that time because no street use permit was granted.\nThe Kings then brought a mandamus action on May 15, 1970, to require the issuance of street use and building permits by the City. On'June 11, 1970, a judgment was entered directing issuance of the building permit and street use permit either in the form requested or upon reasonable terms and without unreasonable delay. The court also found that the prior action of the City in refusing the same was arbitrary and capricious and without justification in law. The building permit was issued on June 16,1970, and a street use permit authorizing construction of two ramps from the existing improved street area to the Kings\u2019 property was issued on July 22,1970.\nOn May 26, 1970, however, the United States Corps of Engineers had changed its regulations to require permits over water areas inside the harbor or pierhead lines. For 70 years prior to this the Corps had required permits only in navigable waters beyond the established harbor or pierhead lines. After the issuance of the street use permit pursuant to court order, the Kings did not make application to the Corps for an overwater building permit for their office building but, apparently, abandoned the project. They ceased making payments on the property in the summer of 1970 and in November 1970, quitclaimed their interest in the property to the vendor following service of a notice of forfeiture. No attempt was made to sell their interest in the property nor was it listed with a real estate broker.\nThe Kings, in this action, seek from the City damages and expenses for their loss of profit on the office building which they were unable to construct. The trial court found that \u201c[fjollowing the revision of the Army Corps regulations, it became impossible for Plaintiffs to construct the proposed office building . . .\u201d (Finding of fact No. 8.), \u201cthe said actions of the Defendant City of Seattle were a proximate cause of the losses and damage sustained by Plaintiffs, and the nature of said damage was reasonably foreseeable\u201d (Finding of fact No. 9.), and \u201cthe actions of the Defendant City of Seattle in refusing to issue a permit to Plaintiffs for an office building, from and after May 7, 1970, and in denying Plaintiffs any access to their own property involved no exercise of discretion, and in no manner were legislative or part of the planning process\u201d (Finding of fact No. 10.).\nThe trial court awarded damages for costs and expenses of $54,524.36 and for lost profits on the proposed office building of $311,018.02.\nThe City appears to attempt to relitigate the characterization of the nature of its acts of April 22 in denying the street use permit and refusing to grant a building permit as arbitrary and capricious and without justification in law. The City\u2019s failure to appeal the findings of fact, conclusions of law and judgment in that case collaterally estops them from litigating those issues and is binding on the parties as to those issues in this case. Parties are collaterally estopped by judgment where the facts and issues claimed to be conclusive on the parties in the second action have been actually and necessarily litigated and determined in a prior action. Henderson v. Bardahl Int\u2019l Cory., 72 Wn.2d 109, 431 P.2d 961 (1967). The doctrine of collateral estoppel differs from res judicata in that, instead of preventing a second assertion of the same claim or cause of action, collateral estoppel prevents a second litigation of issues between the same parties even in connection with a different claim or cause of action. Bordeaux v. Ingersoll Rand Co., 71 Wn.2d 392, 429 P.2d 207 (1967); Goetz v. Board of Trustees, 203 Kan. 340, 454 P.2d 481 (1969).\nThe City urges, however, that its acts were purely of a governmental, policy-implementing character and the abrogation of governmental immunity in Washington did not expose the City to tort liability when performing such functions. Laws of 1963, ch. 159, \u00a7 2 (RCW 4.92.090) provides: \u201cThe state of Washington, whether acting in its governmental or proprietary capacity, shall be liable for damages arising out of its tortious conduct to the same extent as if it were a private person or corporation.\u201d This statute, by its terms, does not render the State liable for all official misconduct. As we said in Evangelical United Brethren Church v. State, 67 Wn.2d 246, 253, 407 P.2d 440 (1965), it is necessary to determine where, in the act of government processes, orthodox tort liability stops and the act of governing begins. \u201cIt is a gross understatement to say . . . that marking a definitive dividing line, with any degree of clarity or certainty, is fraught with some legal as well as factual difficulty.\u201d\nImmunity of governmental officials for discretionary acts historically has been independent of that advanced to justify the immunity of the state from liability for torts for which its agents are liable. The justification for this immunity, as stated by Judge Learned Hand in Gregoire v. Biddle, 177 F.2d 579, 581 (2d Cir. 1949), is that \u201cit is impossible to know whether the claim is well founded until the case has been tried, and that to submit all officials, the innocent as well as the guilty, to the burden of a trial and to the inevitable danger of its outcome, would dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible, in the unflinching discharge of their duties. ... In this instance it has been thought in the end better to leave unredressed the wrongs done by dishonest officers than to subject those who try to do their duty to the constant dread of retaliation.\u201d See also Muskopf v. Corning Hosp. Dist., 55 Cal. 2d 211, 359 P.2d 457, 11 Cal. Rptr. 89 (1961).\nThese fears are not founded upon fact, however, if it is the municipality and not the employee who faces liability. The most promising way to correct the abuses, if a community has the political will to correct them, is to provide incentives to the highest officials by imposing liability on the governmental unit. The ranking officials, motivated by threats to their budget, would issue the order that would be necessary to check the abuses in order to avoid having to pay damages. K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, \u00a7 25.17 (Supp. 1970) at 864-65. The idea that public entities and not officers or employees should ultimately bear liability springs from United States v. Gilman, 347 U.S. 507, 98 L. Ed. 898, 74 S. Ct. 695 (1954).\nAs noted in K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, \u00a7 25.18 (Supp. 1970), at 870:\nA discretionary function exception is essential to a good system of law on governmental tort liability, but the exception should not be pushed beyond the reasons behind it. . . .\n. . . Fears that a system of liability for deliberate torts may cause unwanted results are satisfactorily answered by the experience in New York and California, where governmental units are often liable for deliberate torts of their agents.\nAs we recognized in Evangelical Church, at page 254, \u201c \u2018Liability cannot be imposed when condemnation of the acts or omissions relied upon necessarily brings into question the propriety of governmental objectives or programs or the decision of one who, with the authority to do so, determined that the acts or omissions involved should occur or that the risk which eventuated should be encountered for the advancement of governmental objectives.\u2019 \u201d We then set forth, at page 255, four preliminary questions to assist in ascertaining whether an act was a discretionary governmental process and therefore nontortious, regardless of its lack of wisdom. \u201c (1) Does the challenged act, omission, or decision necessarily involve a basic governmental policy, program, or objective? (2) Is the questioned act, omission, or decision essential to the realization or accomplishment of that policy, program, or objective as opposed to one which would not change the course or direction of the policy, program, or objective? (3) Does the act, omission, or decision require the exercise of basic policy evaluation, judgment, and expertise on the part of the governmental agency involved? (4) Does the governmental agency involved possess the requisite constitutional, statutory, or lawful authority and duty to do or make the challenged act, omission, or decision?\u201d This court concluded that \u201c[i]f these preliminary questions can be clearly and unequivocally answered in the affirmative, then the challenged act, omission, or decision can, with a reasonable degree of assurance, be classified as a discretionary governmental process and nontortious, regardless of its unwisdom. If, however, one or more of the questions call for or suggest a negative answer, then further inquiry may well become necessary, depending upon the facts and circumstances involved.\u201d\nIn further refining what process must be entered into by the court in determining whether an act is discretionary or not, the court in Johnson v. State, 69 Cal. 2d 782, 788, 790, 793, 794, 447 P.2d 352, 73 Cal. Rptr. 240 (1968), rejected as semantic inquiry into the meaning of \u201cdiscretionary\u201d inasmuch as \u201c\u2018[I]t would be difficult to conceive of any official act, no matter how directly ministerial, that did not admit of some discretion in the manner of its performance, even if it involved only the driving of a nail.\u2019 \u201d The court recognized that \u201c \u2018Since obviously no mechanical separation of all activities in which public officials may engage as being either discretionary or ministerial is possible, the determination of the category into which a particular activity falls should be guided by the purpose of the discretionary immunity doctrine.\u2019 \u201d It stressed that judicial abstension should be assured in areas in which the responsibility for \u201cbasic policy decisions has been committed to coordinate branches of government.\u201d The court directed those seeking to determine whether an act is discretionary or not to \u201cfind and isolate those areas of quasi-legislative policy-making which are sufficiently sensitive to justify a blanket rule that courts will not entertain a tort action alleging that careless conduct contributed to the governmental decision.\u201d\nImmunity for \u201cdiscretionary\u201d activities serves no purpose except to assure that courts refuse to pass judgment on policy decisions in the province of coordinate branches of government. Accordingly, to be entitled to immunity the state must make a showing that such a policy decision, consciously balancing risks and advantages, took place. The fact that an employee normally engages in \u201cdiscretionary activity\u201d is irrelevant if, in a given case, the employee did not render a considered decision.\nIn Weiss v. Fote, 7 N.Y.2d 579, 586, 200 N.Y.S.2d 409, 167 N.E.2d 63 (1960), the Buffalo Board of Safety, exercising its discretion, chose a time interval between red and green in traffic lights which a trial jury found to be negligent. The appellate court reversed, reasoning that \u201cabsent some indication that due care was not exercised in the preparation of the design or that no reasonable official could have adopted it \u2014 and there is no indication of either here \u2014 we perceive no basis for preferring the jury verdict, as to the reasonableness of the \u2018clearance interval\u2019, to that of the legally authorized body which made the determination in the first instance.\u201d\nWhatever policy reasons may exist for discretionary immunity, we do not find them present in this case. The finding of fact that the City, through its Board of Public Works, acted arbitrarily and capriciously and without foundation in law and that it \u201cintended to harass and discriminate against Plaintiffs and to prevent Plaintiffs from constructing a commercial building on their property\u201d brings it within the language in the Johnson and Weiss cases. Their holding that it is improper to extend the discretionary activity analysis to those cases where employees do not render a considered decision or render decisions that no reasonable official would have adopted applies here. The question whether the City\u2019s acts complained of here were of a kind usually nominated \u201cministerial\u201d or \u201cdiscretionary\u201d is not material to our determination because earlier they had been determined conclusively to have been arbitrary and capricious.\nThough not characterized by the parties, the tort complained of here is interference with prospective economic advantage. There are three elements to the tort. The plaintiff must prove that he had a relationship with others contemplating a contract, with at least a reasonable expectancy of fruition, that this relationship was known, or reasonably apparent, to the interferor, and that the interference which caused the termination of the relationship or expectancy was intentional. Scymanski v. Dufault, 80 Wn.2d 77, 491 P.2d 1050 (1971).\nThere is a reasonable basis from which to support the trial court\u2019s findings that the City intentionally acted to interfere with the plaintiffs\u2019 known or reasonably foreseeable business expectancy. The City was under a duty to act fairly and reasonably in its dealings with the plaintiffs. The findings of fact from the previous mandamus action, which the City is here collaterally estopped to deny, are to the effect that the City\u2019s acts were arbitrary and capricious and established the City\u2019s patent breach of duty. The City, however, argues in effect that it could not have foreseen the risk of harm which occurred. Specifically, it argues that the City could not and did not foresee the change in the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 overwater building permit criteria which required, for the first time, a Corps permit for over-water building inside the pierhead line and that the City breached no duty to the plaintiffs and was, therefore, not liable for any resulting damage.\nWe have earlier held that foreseeability of the risk of harm to the plaintiff is an element of the duty question. If the risk of harm which befell the plaintiff as a result of the defendant\u2019s act was not reasonably foreseeable, our cases have held, then, as to that plaintiff, no duty respecting that act was owed. Thus, no duty was breached, and no legal liability attached to the defendant for that plaintiff\u2019s loss. Rikstad v. Holmberg, 76 Wn.2d 265, 456 P.2d 355 (1969) ; Wells v. Vancouver, 77 Wn.2d 800, 467 P.2d 292 (1970) . A more complete discussion of the problem is found in Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R., 248 N.Y. 339, 162 N.E. 99, 59 A.L.R. 1253 (1928), dissenting opinion per Andrews, J.; Gregory, Proximate Cause in Negligence \u2014\u2022 A Retreat from \u201cRationalization\u201d, 6 U. Chi. L. Rev. 36, 50 (1938); Prosser, Proximate Cause in California, 38 Cal. L. Rev. 369, 396 (1950).\nLiability extends to foreseeable results from unforeseeable causes. It was foreseeable that arbitrary and capricious delay of the plaintiffs\u2019 building project could cause them damages, increase in the price of materials, the cost of labor, the interest rate on borrowed money, and many other specific areas of harm. Liability is not predicated upon the ability to foresee the exact manner in which the injury may be sustained. Berglund v. Spokane County, 4 Wn.2d 309, 103 P.2d 355 (1940).\nIn Johnson v. Kosmos Portland Cement Co., 64 F.2d 193 (6th Cir. 1933), the defendant failed to remove the hydrocarbon residue from an oil barge, causing it to fill with highly volatile gas. Lightning struck the barge and exploded the gas, killing everyone on board. It was argued that the risk of lightning striking the barge and exploding the gas was not foreseeable and that, therefore, the defendant was not liable for the damages. The defendant was found liable, however. The court reasoned, \u201cwhen the thing done produces immediate danger of injury, and is a substantial factor in bringing it about, it is not necessary that the author of it should have had in mind the particular means by which the potential force he has created might be vitalized into injury.\u201d Johnson v. Kosmos Portland Cement Co., supra at 196. In this case, the result of the City\u2019s action was foreseeable, and the City breached a duty owed to the plaintiffs to protect them from harm of that general nature.\nThe City\u2019s actions here were a cause in fact of the plaintiffs\u2019 damages, and the amount of damages is not disputed. But for the City\u2019s acts which delayed plaintiffs\u2019 ability to begin construction, the plaintiffs would have been able to build the structure over water before the changed Corps rule required a federal permit.\nThis is the sense in which the term \u201cproximate cause\u201d is often discussed. See WPI 15.01. Cause in fact is not, however, the sole determinate of proximate cause, and in a broader sense the question of law as to whether legal liability should attach, given cause in fact, is the question still before us in this case. The plaintiffs here do not present a good cause of action against the City for interference with prospective economic advantage.\nAs a matter of policy we cannot say on these facts that the defendant City should be legally liable for the plaintiffs\u2019 loss. Conceding all the other elements of tort liability are present, they are not sufficient in themselves to make out a prima facie case. The court still must adduce from the record whether, as a policy of law, legal liability should attach to the defendant if the other factual elements are proven and no affirmative defense is made out. \u201c [C] ausation, as such, is a question of fact. Proximate causation is a question of law. The entire doctrine [of proximate cause] assumes that a defendant is not necessarily to be held responsible for all the consequences of his acts.\u201d McLaughlin, Proximate Cause, 39 Harv. L. Rev. 149,155 (1925).\nThe trial court in finding of fact No. 9 determined that the City\u2019s acts were \u201ca proximate cause\u201d of the plaintiffs\u2019 damages. We treat this finding as a conclusion of law, its proper designation, subject to the review of this court as a question of law. See L. Green, Rationale of Proximate Cause, ch. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 3-4 (1927); 1 T. Street, Foundations of Legal Liability, 110 (1906); Terry, Proximate Consequences in the Law of Torts, 28 Harv. L.

    "Andersen, J.\nFacts of Case\nAt issue in this case is whether violations of the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973 come under the Consumer Protection Act.\nThis case of first impression was certified to this court by the State of Washington Court of Appeals, Division One, at the request of the Attorney General. In making such request the Attorney General's office represented that it was \"important that the Attorney General establish whether Residential Landlord-Tenant Act violations indeed violate the Consumer Protection Act\" and that \"because of the significant impact that a ruling on any issue adverse to the state would have, it is probable that legislative changes would need to be sought.\"\nThe defendants in this case are Anthony Schwab and his wife. For convenience, we will refer to Mr. Schwab as though he were the sole defendant. He bought a number of submarginal Seattle residential housing units at tax and lien foreclosure sales and thereafter rented them, usually for less than $150 per month. This litigation primarily concerns four of those units.\nThe defendant's management philosophy, as found by the trial court, was this: \"Defendant Schwab prepared rental agreements for his tenants to sign. These agreements generally provided that in exchange for low rent, the tenant was required to take the premises on an 'as is' basis and that defendant Schwab would not provide repairs or landlord services.\" The defendant's business practices were somewhat informal, at best. For example, the rental agreements were handwritten, and the tenant in one of his units here involved paid no rent at all for the 3V2 years of his tenancy prior to the trial.\nTwo of the tenants complained to the Consumer and Business Fair Practices Division of the State Attorney General's office. Following an investigation, that office filed a Complaint for Injunctive and Additional Relief under the Consumer Protection Act in the Superior Court of the State of Washington for King County.\nFollowing a 4-day trial to the court, the court found as facts that the defendant had violated sections of the City of Seattle Housing Code, Seattle Municipal Code 22.200, and of the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973, RCW 59.18. At this point it should be observed parenthetically that the city housing code violations are, by reference in the landlord-tenant act, RCW 59.18.060(1), made violations of the landlord-tenant act and they are so considered herein. The trial court concluded that the defendant's acts were violations of the landlord-tenant act and of the Consumer Protection Act, RCW 19.86.020.\nActing pursuant to provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, the trial court awarded restitution in the sum of $125 to a tenant found to have made a security deposit that had not been returned and awarded judgment to the State against the defendant for $8,800 in civil penalties and $25,000 in attorneys' fees. Thus, the total judgment against the defendant was $33,925 plus costs. The defendant was also enjoined from further similar acts. In argument before this court the defendant states that he has since sold the houses involved.\nThe defendant appeals; the State cross-appeals alleging that the trial court abused its discretion in not awarding an additional $20,158.05 in attorneys' fees.\nOne question is dispositive of the various issues raised by the appeal and cross appeal.\nIssue\nAre residential tenancies subject to the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act?\nDecision\nConclusion. Residential landlord-tenant problems are within the express purview of the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973, RCW 59.18, and we perceive the Legislature's intent to clearly be that violations of that act do not also constitute violations of the Consumer Protection Act, RCW 19.86. We reverse the trial court.\nIn the interest of readability, the citations in this opinion have been placed in the margin wherever feasible.\nThe Consumer Protection Act, RCW 19.86, declares unlawful \"[ujnfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce\". RCW 19.86.020. The authority of the Attorney General to proceed under the act is found in the following section thereof:\nThe attorney general may bring an action in the name of the state against any person to restrain and prevent the doing of any act herein prohibited or declared to be unlawful; and the prevailing party may, in the discretion of the court, recover the costs of said action including a reasonable attorney's fee.\nThe court may make such additional orders or judgments as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any moneys or property, real or personal, which may have been acquired by means of any act herein prohibited or declared to be unlawful.\nRCW 19.86.080.\nAs this court held in the leading 1972 Consumer Protection Act case of State v. Reader's Digest Ass'n, 81 Wn.2d 259, 275, 501 P.2d 290 (1972), appeal dismissed, 411 U.S. 945, 36 L. Ed. 2d 406, 93 S. Ct. 1927 (1973):\nIn the final analysis, the interpretation of RCW 19.86.020 is left to the state courts. This enables us to arrive at the statute's meaning by the same \"gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion\" used by the federal courts. . . . But in each case the question of what constitutes an \"unfair method of competition\" or an \"unfair or deceptive act or practice\" under RCW 19.86.020 is for us, rather than the federal courts, to determine.\nIn the more than a decade since that decision, this court and the other courts of this state have been engaged in that \"gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion\". Since prevailing claimants in Consumer Protection Act cases are entitled to recover, in addition to actual damages, reasonable attorneys' fees and in some cases treble damages, there has been no dearth of litigation under the act.\nThe Legislature, which adopted the Consumer Protection Act in the first instance, has further facilitated this inclusion and exclusion process. It has done so by responding from time to time to problems in the marketplace by including certain designated activities within the ambit of the act. The Legislature has, for example, specifically placed within the scope of the Consumer Protection Act such widely diverse activities as charitable solicitations, chain distributor schemes, usurious contracts, camping clubs, unfair motor vehicle business practices, discriminatory practices, consumer leases, time share activities, land development, debt adjusting, hearing aid sales, embalming and funeral directing businesses and telephone equipment sales.\nAs will be looked at shortly, the Legislature has also considered, hut rejected, the inclusion of other activities within the act.\nBy inclusion of the foregoing activities within the act, not only is the Attorney General's office authorized to act in such matters, as it has in this case, but private litigants are likewise empowered to utilize the remedies provided them by the act.\nThere is a marked difference between the judicial and legislative processes of inclusion and exclusion of activities under the Consumer Protection Act. In the legislative process, the people engaged in the activity sought to be specifically included within the act have the full opportunity to be heard and to have their particular problems considered at legislative hearings. Furthermore, the merits of any such proposed inclusion are subject to debate and amendment in legislative committees and on the floor of the respective houses of the Legislature.\nThe judicial process, on the other hand, does not always provide equivalent opportunities. In the present case, for example, the State Attorney General's office represents the interests of the public (and indirectly the rights of the individual tenants), whereas the landlord appearing pro se represents himself in a case which potentially affects every person in the state who rents out or ever will rent out one or more dwelling units. Although the Legislature has mandated that the \"act shall be liberally construed that its beneficial purposes may be served\", RCW 19.86.920, that is not to say that the judiciary should not give the most careful consideration to the \"process of judicial inclusion and exclusion\" of activities under the act.\nThe Attorney General in this case, as suggested by some commentators in the past, urges this court to hold that the Consumer Protection Act, RCW 19.86, is available as a vehicle for enforcing tenants' rights as those rights are established by the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973, RCW 59.18. One recurring argument, as expressed in the Attorney General's brief herein, is that \"violations of statutes promulgated in the public interest constitute per se violations, thus creating in the state a power of enforcement in order that the beneficial purposes of the statutes are carried out.\" Since all statutes are presumably promulgated by the Legislature in the public interest, this is tantamount to arguing that any violation of a statute is a per se violation of the public interest and that a Consumer Protection Act action can be brought thereon by either the Attorney General or a private party. This court rejected that precise argument in Haner v. Quincy Farm Chems., Inc., 97 Wn.2d 753, 761-63, 649 P.2d 828 (1982). As succinctly put in Sato v. Century 21 Ocean Shores Real Estate, 101 Wn.2d 599, 601, 681 P.2d 242 (1984), \"not every violation of a statute results in a per se consumer protection action.\"\nIt would serve no useful purpose to recite all of the Attorney General's arguments herein other than to note that in substantial part they track the above referenced law review commentators. With due consideration to those arguments, we nevertheless perceive the following three aspects of this matter to be determinative.\nFirst, nothing in the legislative history of the enactment of the Consumer Protection Act suggests that it was ever intended by the Legislature to be applied to the rental of residential housing. The Consumer Protection Act had as its genesis a study conducted by the Washington State Consumer Advisory Council, a 33-person committee appointed by the Governor and chaired by the State Attorney General. We have found nothing in the history of that committee's work, which was completed in I960, or in the 1961 legislative deliberations on the bill which became the Consumer Protection Act, which in any way suggests that the vast array of residential landlord-tenant problems were among the types of unfair, deceptive and fraudulent acts or practices that the Consumer Protection Act was intended to address.\nThis is not to suggest that this historical perspective is determinative of the coverage of the Consumer Protection Act in this case; it is not. The unfair practices and competition language of RCW 19.86.020 was intentionally drawn with a broad brush to cover a broad range of human inventiveness. The history of the act is, however, a relevant factor to be considered when confronted, as we are here, with an effort to include for the first time the residential landlord-tenant relationship within the 2V2-decade-old Consumer Protection Act aimed at abuses in \"trade\" and \"commerce\".\nSecond, the respective rights and duties of residential tenants and landlords are spelled out in great detail, and an array of specific remedies provided for violations thereof, in a single comprehensive enactment, the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973, RCW 59.18. Nothing in that enactment purports to give the Attorney General any enforcement authority for violations of it.\nExhaustive efforts on the part of concerned parties and legislators went into the drafting and enactment of the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973. This work included the following: unsuccessful efforts in pre-1973 legislative sessions to pass such a bill; negotiations extending over a 9-month period by an ad hoc citizens' committee under the auspices of the Joint Interim Judiciary Committee; the introduction in the 1973 legislative session of bills in both the House and the Senate; numerous committee hearings on the bills in both houses; and the fashioning of a compromise bill by a joint House-Senate committee that worked on the bills. In addition, before the bill finally passed the Legislature at the 1973 legislative session, there was considerable floor debate in both houses, including 2 full days of debate on the Senate floor. The consideration of the bill included numerous floor amendments in both houses, the adoption of some 22 amendments in the House and the adoption of about half of the 110 floor amendments considered by the Senate.\nThe Governor thereupon exercised his item veto on the bill 14 times. In due course, this court was heard from on the bill and in Washington Ass'n of Apartment Ass'ns, Inc. v. Evans, 88 Wn.2d 563, 564 P.2d 788 (1977), the item vetoes were declared invalid. The enactment thus became settled law in the form in which it passed the Legislature.\nIn sum, it is hard to perceive of a more thoroughly considered piece of legislation than the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973. The history of that enactment shows the care exercised by the Legislature in writing the act and in delineating the specific rights, duties, and remedies of both landlords and tenants. For this reason, along with the other reasons stated herein, we decline to now expand the coverage of that act by interpretation so as to include a Consumer Protection Act cause of action.\nAt this point it is appropriate to observe parenthetically that the tenants who were renting premises on an \"as is\" basis here, in violation by the landlord of the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973, had the right to themselves proceed directly against the landlord and recover their actual damages as well as reasonable attorneys' fees under the protective provisions of that act.\nThird, the 1973 Legislature first considered, then rejected, an amendment to the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973 which by its express terms would have provided that violations \"of the provisions of this chapter shall be construed, for the purposes of application of the Consumer Protection Act, chapter 19.86 RCW, to constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice or an unfair method of competition in the conduct of trade or commerce.\" This amendment was considered on the floor of the Senate. Before the amendment was voted down, one senator questioned whether the Attorney General's office had sufficient staff to handle such a job, and another senator questioned the wisdom of opening the door to treble damages under the Consumer Protection Act when a double damages amendment had just been voted down. This demonstrates that the Senate was well aware of the effect of what it was doing when it turned down the amendment extending the Consumer Protection Act to violations of the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973; so too does the fact that this same Legislature enacted legislation expressly applying the Consumer Protection Act to other activities such as charitable solicitations and chain distribution schemes.\nIt is the duty of this court to ascertain and give effect to the intent and purposes of the Legislature as expressed in its enactments. This court has held that the Consumer Protection Act \"is not applicable and will not support a private action where there is a specific legislative declaration that the public does not have an interest in a particular subject matter.\" Anhold v. Daniels, 94 Wn.2d 40, 43, 614 P.2d 184 (1980), citing Brown v. Charlton, 90 Wn.2d 362, 583 P.2d 1188 (1978) with approval. That same reasoning applies where the Legislature has otherwise clearly evinced its intent that designated activities not be covered by the Consumer Protection Act as in this case.\nBased on the foregoing three reasons, we perceive the intent of the Legislature to have been that residential landlord-tenant problems not be included within the Consumer Protection Act, RCW 19.86, either directly through that act or indirectly through means of the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973, RCW 59.18, and the per se doctrine. Neither the statutory direction to liberally construe the Consumer Protection Act nor the right to resort to remedies \"otherwise provided by law\" as expressed in the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973, justify the judicial extension of a remedy at odds with a clearly demonstrated legislative intent to the contrary.\nThus, the trial court erred in holding as it did.\nIf, as argued by the Attorney General, it is important from a public policy standpoint for that office (and thereby for private litigants as well) to be empowered to proceed under the Consumer Protection Act for egregious violations of the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973, then the request for such authority should appropriately be addressed to the Legislature.\nReversed and dismissed.\nUtter, Brachtenbach, Dolliver, Dimmick, and Pearson, JJ., concur.\nFinding of fact 9.\nRCW 19.86.090; RCW 19.86.080.\nRCW 19.09.340.\nRCW 19.102.020.\nRCW 19.52.036.\nRCW 19.105.500.\nRCW 46.70.220.\nRCW 49.60.030(3).\nRCW 63.10.050.\nRCW 64.36.170.\nRCW 58.19.270.\nRCW 18.28.185.\nRCW 18.35.180.\nRCW 18.39.350.\nRCW 19.130.060.\nRCW 19.86.080.\nRCW 19.86.090.\nSeaboard Sur.

    "Rosellini, J.\nThese actions were brought by owners of waterfront properties on the west shore of Lake Washington, near the point where Thornton Creek flows into the lake. Thornton Creek is a natural watercourse draining a large area in Seattle and King County. Silt carried by the stream is deposited at its mouth, forming a delta. It was the theory of the plaintiffs that activities of the city had increased the amount of siltation, causing the delta to build up rapidly and interfere with the use and enjoyment of their property. The causes were consolidated and tried before a jury, which returned a verdict in favor of the city.\nPrior to submission of the issue of constitutional damaging to the jury, the parties had stipulated that the question of damages only should be submitted, while the determination of whether injunctive relief should be afforded would be reserved for the court. Consequently, after the verdict was returned, the trial court took under consideration the question whether the delta constituted a nuisance, made findings that it did, and enjoined the city in each case from\n\u201c. . . maintaining a drainage system which collects and discharges into Thornton Creek any amount or any rate of silt or sediment in excess of the amount or rate which Thornton Creek transported in its natural condition. For the purposes of this injunction the natural capacity and the amount and rate of silting and sedimentation of Thornton Creek, in its natural condition, shall be as Thornton Creek existed prior to the year 1921.\u201d\nThe injunction continued:\n\u201cIt Is Further Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that unless the City of Seattle takes corrective measures to prevent the deposit of silt and sediment in excess of the amount or rate which Thornton Creek transported in its natural condition, then the City of Seattle shall be liable in damages to the plaintiffs.\u201d\nThis injunction was founded upon the following conclusion of law entered by the court:\n\u201cThe defendant City of Seattle in the erection, operation, and maintenance, use and repair of a connected system of storm sewage throughout the Thornton Creek watershed, within the corporate limits of the City of Seattle, created a nuisance specially injurious to the plaintiffs by reason of the silt deposits upon the property of the plaintiffs, proximately caused by the acts of the defendant City of Seattle in the maintenance of its storm drainage system and its control of surface water within the area of the Thornton Creek watershed within its municipal boundaries.\u201d\nIt is the position of the city that this conclusion and the injunctive decrees were not justified by the facts. The evidence was that the city had annexed about two thirds of the watershed in recent years, and that there has been a rapid urbanization of the area. The stream in question flows over private property for the most part, except where it crosses city streets. The city paved streets and constructed ditches and culverts to direct the flow of surface waters. It did not increase the area of the watershed or the amount of surface waters. It did construct sanitary sewers to serve a large part of the area, and these sewers diverted some of the water that had previously drained into the creek. It also took over a diversion weir which had been previously constructed and which was designed to take care of overflow.\nThere had twice been a flooding of properties of some of the plaintiffs during heavy rainfalls. Damages were awarded for these two invasions of the properties, and the city does not question the propriety of these awards. There was no evidence that the banks of the stream had overflowed on other occasions.\nThere was evidence that the channeling of surface water into ditches and the paving of streets and making of other improvements on land in the watershed resulted in an increased turbulence in the stream, which caused a greater amount of silt to be carried down the stream than was the case when the watershed was in its natural state.\nWe need not consider the city\u2019s contention that the jury verdicts foreclosed any determination by the trial court that it had created a nuisance. We think the applicable rule of law is clear. It is set forth in the case of Laurelon Terrace v. Seattle, 40 Wn. (2d) 883, 246 P. (2d) 1113, and was recently restated in Buxel v. King Cy., 60 Wn. (2d) 404, 374 P. (2d) 250.\n' In the Laurelon case, the city had constructed sewers which utilized a natural stream for overflow of waters which the sewers collected in the watershed served, by the stream. There was no showing that the city increased the flow beyond its natural capacity. During heavy rains, property of the plaintiff was flooded by the stream; the plaintiff brought suit against the city. In holding that the evidence would support no verdict other than one in favor of the defendant, and after holding that the discharge of sewage into the stream was not actionable unless it increased the flow beyond its natural capacity, we said:\n\u201cPlaintiff argues that, by doing additional paving and surfacing north of 55th street, as well as diverting the ditch into the stream, the city breached its duty to plaintiff, in that the flow of the stream was artificially accelerated and incidentally increased. It is well settled that the flow of surface water along natural drains may be hastened or incidentally increased by artificial means, so long as the water is not ultimately diverted from its natural flow onto the property of another. Annotations, 5 A.L.R. 1530; Annotations 36 A.L.R. 1463. A city is not negligent if it increases the flow of water through a natural drainway, due to streets and catchbasins, unless the drainage is increased beyond the capacity of the watercourse in its natural condition. In Bowling Green v. Stevens, 205 Ky. 161, 265 S. W. 495, the court said:\n\u201c \u2018The argument is that the new buildings and streets had the effect of causing to flow into the drain a quantity of water that would have been absorbed by the natural surface of the land. Manifestly, the rights of the lower proprietor are subject to the right of the upper proprietor to use his land in the natural and ordinary way, so long as there is no substantial change in the natural flow of the water. Hence, though the upper proprietor has no right to open or remove natural barriers and turn on lower lands surface water which would not otherwise flow in that direction, he has the right, even by ditches and drains, to drain the surface water from his own land into the channels which nature has provided, even though the quantity of water thrown upon the lower lands is thereby increased. [Citing cases.] The rule has been applied in favor of a municipal corporation and its right to carry off surface water in order to improve the streets and render its territory more suitable for building purposes has been recognized.\u2019 (p.162)\u201d\nAs in that case, there is no evidence here that the city was negligent in accelerating drainage by the installation of street paving, culvert, and ditches.\nIn Trigg v. Timmerman, 90 Wash. 678, 156 Pac. 846, where damage resulting from the construction of channels by an upper riparian owner was claimed, we quoted with approval the following language from Manteufel v. Wetzel, 133 Wis. 619, 114 N. W. 91, 19 L.R.A. (N.S.) 167:\n\u201c \u2018Where the upper proprietor does no more than collect in a ditch, which ditch follows the course of the usual flow of surface water, the surface water which formerly took the same, course toward the land of the lower adjacent proprietor, and causes to pass through this ditch the surface water which formerly took the same course but spread out over the surface, he has committed no actionable legal wrong of which the lower proprietor can complain, or upon which such lower proprietor can maintain an action. In other words, causing surface water to flow in its natural direction through a ditch on one\u2019s own land, instead of over the surface or by percolation as formerly, where no new watershed is tapped by said ditch and no addition to the former volume of surface water is caused thereby, except the mere carrying in a ditch what formerly reached the same point on defendant\u2019s land over a wider surface by percolation through the soil, or by flowing over such wider surface, is not, when not negligently done,' a wrongful or unlawful act.\u2019 \u201d\nThe plaintiffs cite many authorities, but none of them pertain to the question presented here. For the most part, they concern the construction of sewers by municipalities, or the maintenance of same, in such manner as to cause damage to the property of others. None stands for the proposition that a city can be held liable for the nonnegligent constructing of streets, culverts, and ditches, simply because these improvements cause an acceleration of the velocity and turbulence of water in a stream which is the natural receiver of surface waters drained from the area.\nThe injunction decreed by the trial court purported to place upon the city a greater burden than that imposed by law. For this reason it must be dissolved. If at some future time the plaintiffs can show that activities of the city have increased the flow of the stream beyond its natural capacity, with resultant damage to them, that will afford the basis for another law suit.\nIn a cross-appeal, the plaintiffs contend that verdicts should have been directed in their favor. As we have previously stated, the evidence supports only verdicts in favor of the city.\nThe judgments are reversed insofar as they grant injunc-tive relief to the plaintiffs, and in all other respects they are affirmed.\nOtt, C. J., Hill, Hunter, and Hale, JJ., concur."

    "Wright, J.\nThis is an action for property damage allegedly caused by the defective design and installation of a certain faulty refrigeration system and equipment in a cold storage warehouse.\nAppellant Cohodas-Lancaster-Frank Company, Inc. is the owner of a cold storage warehouse in the city of Yakima, Washington which it leases to the Yakima Fruit & Cold Storage Company, Inc. The owners and officers of the Yakima Fruit & Cold Storage Company, Inc. are: S. M. Cohodas, President; Paul Lancaster, Vice-president; and Herbert Frank, Secretary-Treasurer and General Manager. Respondent, Central Heating & Plumbing Company, Inc., is a corporation engaged in construction work specializing, inter alia, in refrigeration systems.\nOn July 3, 1961, Yakima Fruit and respondent entered into a written contract whereby respondent was to construct and install a refrigeration system and equipment in the above-mentioned warehouse in order to modernize its use as a cold storage warehouse.\nThe refrigeration system and equipment were to be similar to those in another of Yakima Fruit\u2019s cold storage warehouses located across the street from the structure here involved. The installation in the warehouse across the street had been designed by a registered professional engineer, and that system was copied, as closely as was feasible. In conjunction with the installation of the refrigeration system, an entire floor of the warehouse was removed. Eighteen thousand feet of pipe, which had been attached to the same building for more than 40 years, was refashioned and reinstalled to the building, utilizing approximately 500 welds to join the system in as permanent a fashion as was possible.\nPayment for the work done by the respondent was made by the owner of the building, Cohodas-Lancaster-Frank Company, Inc., after the work had been completed during the calendar year 1961.\nOn May 26,' 1968, a portion of the cold storage systeni and equipment collapsed, causing damage to fruit stored in the warehouse in excess of $100,000.\nAppellants\u2019 complaint for property damage was dismissed upon respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment, on the basis that the action was barred by RCW 4.16.300 through 4.16.320, because such action did not accrue within 6 years of the date of completion of the work performed by the respondent. This appeal is taken from the trial court\u2019s summary judgment of dismissal.\nThe first issue raised on appeal is whether the trial court erred in granting the respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment and thereby finding that no genuine issue existed as to any material fact.\nPursuant to CR 56(c), a summary judgment is only available where, \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d\nFor purposes of a summary judgment procedure, a reviewing court is required, as was the trial court, to review material submitted for and against a motion for summary judgment in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made. Robert Wise Plumbing & Heating, Inc. v. Alpine Dev. Co., 72 Wn.2d 172, 432 P.2d 547 (1967). The motion should be granted only if, from the evidence, reasonable men could reach but one conclusion. CR 56 (c); Meissner v. Simpson Timber Co., 69 Wn.2d 949, 421 P.2d 674 (1966).\nIn the instant case, appellants urge that a material question of fact was presented, i.e., whether the construction by respondent constituted an improvement to real property (making RCW 4.16.300 et seq. applicable) or whether it constituted installation of a removable trade fixture, which would be personalty.\nWhile in some cases the line between what is real property and what is personal property may be difficult to define, here it seems extremely plain that we are dealing with realty.\nIn Wade v. Donau Brewing Co., 10 Wash. 284, 38 P. 1009, 64 A.L.R. 1224 (1894), a refrigerating plant installed in a brewery was held to be a part of the realty. The court adopted as the test for determining whether improvements or installations on the realty retain their character as personalty or become a part of the realty, the rule that the manner, purpose and effect of annexation to the freehold must be regarded. Referring to Cherry v. Arthur, 5 Wash. 787, 32 P. 744 (1893), the court stated that if a building is erected for a definite purpose, whatever is built into it to enhance its value for occupation becomes a part of it.\nIndeed, the above-cited case is strikingly similar to the instant case. The building here in question could be utilized as a cold storage warehouse only if it remained refrigerated, as it had since 1919. The owner of the warehouse paid for the reinstallation of pipe, coils, hangers and rods which replaced those which had been an integral part of the building for 40 years. The purpose of this reinstallation was definite; i.e., to maintain the structure as a cold storage warehouse. This system could not be removed with both the system and building remaining intact.\nFor the reasons set forth above, it cannot be reasonably concluded that a material question of fact was presented as to whether the construction by respondent constituted an improvement to real property within the purview of RCW 4.16.300 et seq. Accordingly, the trial court was correct in granting respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment of dismissal.\nThe second issue raised on appeal is whether the respondent committed acts which would prohibit respondent from relying upon RCW 4.16.300 et seq.\nThe basis for that contention is the failure of respondent to employ a licensed engineer. The contract called for respondent to design as well as to install the refrigeration system. It is alleged by appellants that respondent, by designing the system, did an unlawful act under RCW 18.43.010. Therefore, respondent allegedly would not be entitled to claim protection under the nonclaim statute for work performed that it was not licensed to do. See Meyer v. Simpson, 34 Wn.2d 486, 209 P.2d 294 (1949).\nThe record reflects that no design work was involved, because the installation of refrigeration equipment was to be based on design specifications of a professional engineer for a prior installation by respondent in appellants\u2019 similar building across the street from the structure in question. Moreover, RCW 4.16.300 et seq. can be used by any person having constructed, altered or repaired any improvement upon real property; and respondent would, therefore, fit into the statute regardless of its allegedly having furnished design services in violation of another statute.\nThe third issue raised on appeal is whether RCW 4.16.300 et seq. is constitutional.\nAppellants contend that the statute is special class legislation forbidden by the Washington Constitution, article 1, section 12. On the same basis, appellants allege that the statute in question violates the United States Constitution, amendment 14, section 1, which forbids states to pass any laws denying equal protection to any of their citizens.\nSince 1961, more than 20 states have enacted similar statutes relative to actions arising out of defects in improvements to real property. One of these states is the neighboring state of Oregon, which has just recently held its similar statute is constitutional. Josephs v. Burns, 93 Ore. 1340, 491 P.2d 203 (1971).\nThe case of Skinner v. Anderson, 38 Ill. 2d 455, 231 N.E.2d 588 (1967), declared the Illinois statute unconstitutional as being special legislation in favor of only architects and contractors. The same cannot be said of RCW 4.16.300 et seq. because the scope of the Washington provision is not limited as to vocation. The subject statute bars actions against any person having constructed, altered or repaired any improvement upon real property.\nThe court of no other state than Illinois has found its similar statute unconstitutional; nor has the legislature of any state other than Illinois repealed the legislation.\nThe judgment of dismissal is affirmed.\nHamilton, C.J., Finley, Rosellini, Hunter, Hale, Neill, Stafford, and Utter, JJ., concur.\nPetition for rehearing denied January 31, 1973."

    "Hunter, J.\nThis is an unlawful detainer action in which the plaintiff (respondent), Ronald D. Foisy, is seeking the possession of his real property, unpaid rent and damages. The defendant (appellant), Richard Kent Wyman, appeals from a judgment in favor of the plaintiff.\nIn his complaint, the plaintiff alleged in effect; (1) That on December 31, 1970, the defendant took possession of a house which the plaintiff is seeking to recover, pursuant to a 6-month lease requiring $300 to be paid for said term, plus water and other utility charges; (2) that during the term of the lease the defendant paid the sum of $95, leaving $205 still owing for the 6-month period; (3) that the defendant remained upon the premises after the expiration of the lease; (4) that the rental payment after the expiration of the lease was to be $75 per month; (5) that after the defendant refused to pay the accrued rent, the plaintiff served a 3-day notice to pay rent or vacate upon the defendant on August 27, 1971; (6) that the defendant failed to pay any of the amounts owing after the 3-day notice was served upon him.\nThe defendant\u2019s answer raised several affirmative defenses including breach of implied warranty of habitability.\nDuring trial the defendant testified that he took possession of the house on March 3, 1971. It appears that the parties executed the lease in question on March 8, 1971, although the lease was dated December 31, 1970, and was to cover a term of 6 months, which was to commence on January 1,1971, and end on June 30,1971.\nThe lease in question also contained an option to purchase. The testimony of the defendant indicates that he thought he was purchasing the house rather than renting it. His testimony also indicates that the house contained a number of defects when he entered into the lease and it indicates that he was aware of some of the defects when he agreed to rent the house, but not all of them.\nThe trial court concluded that the defendant was guilty of unlawful detainer of the premises rented to him by the plaintiff. However, it refused to enforce the provisions of what it termed the \u201cpurported lease.\u201d It found that the reasonable rental for the period of occupancy of the premises was the sum of $50 per month commencing with March 3, 1971, until such time as the defendant removed himself. In effect, the court held the lease was invalid. The court also held that a writ of restitution should issue to the sheriff to require the surrender of possession if the defendant did not voluntarily withdraw and that damages for the period March 3, 1971, through April 3, 1972, were to be doubled if the defendant did not surrender the premises by April 3, 1972. The defendant appeals, although the plaintiff does not cross-appeal from the court\u2019s findings.\nThe primary contention raised by the defendant is that the trial court erred in refusing to accept evidence as to his affirmative defense of breach of implied warranty of habitability. The defendant argues that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to maintain the premises in a habitable condition constitutes a failure of consideration upon the part of the plaintiff and relieves the defendant of his obligation to pay rent. We agree that the tenant should have been permitted to introduce evidence at trial in support of this theory of defense.\nThe premises in question, according to the testimony of the defendant, contained a number of defects including a lack of heat, no hot water tank, broken windows, a broken door, water running through the bedroom, an improperly seated and leaking toilet, a leaking sink in the bathroom, broken water pipes in the yard and termites in the basement. No objection was made to the introduction of this testimony. The testimony of the defendant also indicates that he painted the interior and made repairs upon the premises, but ceased making repairs when he learned of a municipal court action being initiated against the plaintiff as a result of numerous housing code violations within the house. In addition, the record reveals that the landlord was informed of the defects and was prosecuted successfully for violations of the Seattle housing code.\nDuring the trial the defendant attempted to introduce the testimony of two housing inspectors as to the housing code violations which existed on the premises. The trial court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s objections to this testimony upon the theory that the condition of the premises was not relevant to the issue before the court. We disagree with the reasoning of the trial court in refusing to accept the evidence as to the condition of the premises, although it should be stated that this issue has not been heretofore specifically addressed in this jurisdiction in relation to our unlawful detainer statutes.\nThroughout the United States, the old rule of caveat emptof in the leasing of premises has been undergoing judicial scrutiny.\nIn Pines v. Perssion, 14 Wis. 2d 590, 596, 111 N.W.2d 409 (1961), the court stated:\nTo follow the old rule of no implied warranty of habitability in leases would, in our opinion, be inconsistent with the current legislative policy concerning housing standards. The need and social desirability of adequate housing for people in this era of rapid population increases is too important to be rebuffed by that obnoxious legal clich\u00e9, caveat emptor. Permitting landlords to rent \u201ctumble-down\u201d houses is at least a contributing cause of such problems as urban blight, juvenile delinquency, and high property taxes for conscientious landowners.\nSee Reste Realty Corp. v. Cooper, 53 N.J. 444, 251 A.2d 268 (1969); Marini v. Ireland, 56 N.J. 130, 265 A.2d 526 (1970); Lemle v. Breeden, 51 Hawaii 426, 462 P.2d 470 (1969); Javins v. First Nat\u2019l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925, 27 L. Ed. 2d 185, 91 S. Ct. 186 (1970), and Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill. 2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).\nIn Lemle v. Breeden, supra, the court reviewed the rule of caveat emptor and the current trend toward finding an implied warranty of habitability in leases, and stated on page 433:\nThe application of an implied warranty of habitability in leases gives recognition to the changes in leasing transactions today. It affirms the fact that a lease is, in essence, a sale as well as a transfer of an estate in land and is, more importantly, a contractual relationship. From that contractual relationship an implied warranty of habitability and fitness for the purposes intended is a just and necessary implication. It is a doctrine which has its counterparts in the law of sales and torts and one which when candidly countenanced is impelled by the nature of the transaction and contemporary housing realities. Legal fictions and artificial exceptions to wooden rules of property law aside, we hold that in the lease of a dwelling house, such as in this case, there is an implied warranty of habitability and fitness for the use intended.\n(Footnote omitted.)\nIn Javins v. First Nat\u2019l Realty Corp., supra, the court analyzed the various exceptions to the common-law rule that the lessor has no duty to repair and stated on page 1078:\nThese as well as other similar cases demonstrate that some courts began some time ago to question the common law\u2019s assumptions that the land was the most important feature of a leasehold and that the tenant could feasibly make any necessary repairs himself. Where those assumptions no longer reflect contemporary housing patterns, the courts have created exceptions to the general rule that landlords have no duty to keep their premises in repair.\nIt is overdue for courts to admit that these assumptions are no longer true with regard to all urban housing. Today\u2019s urban tenants, the vast majority of whom live in multiple dwelling houses, are interested, not in the land, but solely in \u201ca house suitable for occupation.\u201d Furthermore, today\u2019s city dweller usually has a single, specialized skill unrelated to maintenance work; he is unable to make repairs like the \u201cjack-of-all-trades\u201d farmer who was the common law\u2019s model of the lessee. Further, unlike his agrarian predecessor who often remained on one piece of land for his entire life, urban tenants today are more mobile than ever before. A tenant\u2019s tenure in a specific apartment will often not be sufficient to justify efforts at repairs. In addition, the increasing complexity of today\u2019s dwellings renders them much more difficult to repair than the structures of earlier times. In a multiple dwelling repair may require access to equipment and areas in the control of the landlord. Low and middle income tenants, even if they were interested in making repairs, would be unable to obtain any financing for major repairs since they have no long-term interest in the property.\n(Footnotes omitted.)\nWe find the reasoning of these cases extremely persuasive. Any realistic analysis of the lessor-lessee or landlord-tenant situation leads to the conclusion that the tenant\u2019s promise to pay rent is in exchange for the landlord\u2019s promise to provide a livable dwelling. As Judge Skelly Wright stated in the Javins case on page 1074:\nWhen American city dwellers, both rich and poor, seek \u201cshelter\u201d today, they seek a well known package of goods and services \u2014 a package which includes not merely walls and ceilings, but also adequate heat, light and ventilation, serviceable plumbing facilities, secure windows and doors, proper sanitation, and proper maintenance.\n(Footnote omitted.) Javins v. First Nat'l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925, 27 L. Ed. 2d 185, 91 S. Ct. 186 (1970). The value of the lease today then, whether it is oral or written, is that it gives the tenant a place to live, and he expects not just space but a dwelling that protects him from the elements of the environment without subjecting him to health hazards.\nIn House v. Thornton, 76 Wn.2d 428, 457 P.2d 199 (1969), we rejected the doctrine of caveat emptor as it applied to the sale of a new residence and found an implied warranty that the structure is fit for the buyer\u2019s intended purpose. In doing so, we noted that the old rule of caveat emptor has little relevance to the sale of a brand-new house by a vendor-builder to a first buyer for the purposes of occupancy. By analogy, the old rule of caveat emptor has little relevance to the renting of premises in our society. There can be little justification for following a rule that was developed for an agrarian society and has failed to keep pace with modern day realities. We therefore hold that in all contracts for the renting of premises, oral or written, there is an implied warranty of habitability and breach of this warranty constitutes a defense in an unlawful detainer action. See Javins v. First Nat\u2019l Realty Corp., supra; Lund v. MacArthur, 51 Hawaii 473, 462 P.2d 482 (1969); Marini v. Ireland, 56 N.J. 130, 265 A.2d 526 (1970); Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill. 2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).\nIt can be argued, however, that the defendant should not be entitled to the protection of an implied warranty of habitability since he knew of a substantial number of defects when he rented the premises and the rent was reduced from $87 per month to $50 per month. We believe this type of bargaining by the landlord with the tenant is contrary to public policy and the purpose of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability. A disadvantaged tenant should not be placed in a position of agreeing to live in an uninhabitable premises. Housing conditions, such as the record indicates exist in the instant case, are a health hazard, not only to the individual tenant, but to the community which is exposed to said individual. As the court recognized in Pines v. Perssion, supra, such housing conditions are at least a contributing cause of such problems as urban blight, juvenile delinquency and high property taxes for the conscientious landowners.\nOur belief that public policy demands such a result is reinforced by our review of Laws of 1973, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 207, which became effective July 16, 1973. The legislature in passing this bill and the Governor in signing it have recognized that public policy demands this result. Laws of 1973, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 207, provides in part:\nSec. 6. The landlord will at all times during the tenancy keep the premises fit for human habitation, and shall in particular:\n(1) Maintain the premises to substantially comply with any applicable code, statute, ordinance, or regulation governing their maintenance or operation, which the legislative body enacting the applicable code, statute, ordinance or regulation could enforce as to the premises rented;\n(2) Maintain the roofs, floors, walls, chimneys, fireplaces, foundations, and all other structural components in reasonably good repair so as to be usable and capable of resisting any and all normal forces and loads to which they may be subjected;\n(5) Except where the condition is attributable to normal wear and tear, make repairs and arrangements necessary to put and keep the premises in as good condition as it by law or rental agreement should have been, at the commencement of the tenancy;\n(7) Maintain all electrical, plumbing, heating, and other facilities and appliances supplied by him in reasonably good working order;\n(8) Maintain the dwelling unit in reasonably weather-tight condition;\n(10) Except where the building is not equipped for the purpose, provide facilities adequate to supply heat and water and hot water as reasonably required by the tenant;\nSec. 8. The tenant shall be current in the payment of rent before exercising any of th\u00e9 remedies accorded him under the provisions of this chapter: Provided, That this section shall not be construed as limiting the tenant\u2019s civil remedies for negligent or intentional damages: Provided Further, That this section shall not be construed as limiting the tenant\u2019s right in an unlawful detainer proceeding to raise the defense that there is no rent due and owing.\nSec. 10.\n(6) Nothing in this section shall prevent the tenant from agreeing with the landlord to undertake the repairs himself in return for cash payment or a reasonable reduction in rent, the agreement thereof to be agreed upon between the parties, and such agreement does not alter the landlord\u2019s obligations under this chapter.\nIt may also be argued that the defendant should not be afforded the protection of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability since the defendant signed a lease which contained an option to purchase. However, as heretofore stated, the trial court failed to recognize the validity of the lease. There is no cross-appeal from this determination and we are therefore bound by the trial court\u2019s decision.\nThe plaintiff argues that the trial court was correct in disregarding the Seattle housing code as it was improperly pleaded and no properly authenticated copy of the housing code was offered. These issues were not before the court when it rejected the testimony of the housing inspectors. It was not until after the court had rejected the testimony of the housing inspectors on the basis of their testimony being irrelevant that the housing code was offered into evidence. Had the court rejected the housing code on the grounds suggested by the plaintiff, the defendant would have been in a position to move to amend his pleadings. The argument as to the housing code not being properly authenticated, we believe, is without merit in view of RCW 5.44.080 which states:\nWhen the ordinances of any city or town are printed by authority of such municipal corporation, the printed copies thereof shall be received as prima facie evidence that such ordinances as printed and published were duly passed.\nThe copy of the housing code that was offered into evidence by the defendant is printed by authority of the City of Seattle and is therefore prima facie evidence that the ordinances as printed and published were duly passed.\nThe testimony relating to the housing code violations should have been admitted into evidence, and the trial court erred in ruling that the condition of the premises was not relevant to the issue of rent due and owing. While the housing code violations in and of themselves do not establish a prima facie case that the premises are uninhabitable, they are evidence which aids in establishing that the premises are uninhabitable.\nThe plaintiff argues, in effect, however, that the unlawful detainer statutes are not designed for defenses such as breach of implied warranty of habitability due to the nature of the action. In light of our previous discussion, we believe this to be without merit.\nOne of the basic issues in an unlawful detainer action of this nature is whether or not there is any rent due. RCW 59.12.170, which governs the entry of judgment and execution in an unlawful detainer action, states that upon a finding of default in the payment of rent, \u201cthe judgment shall also declare the forfeiture of the lease, agreement or tenancy.\u201d RCW 59.12.030 provides:\nA tenant of real property for a term less than life is guilty of unlawful detainer either:\n(3) When he continues in possession in person or by subtenant after a default in the payment of rent, and after notice in writing requiring in the alternative the payment of the rent or the surrender of the detained premises . . .\nSince the affirmative defense of breach of implied warranty of habitability goes directly to the issue of rent due and owing, which is one of the basic issues in an unlawful detainer action as the above statutes indicate, we now hold said defense is available in an unlawful detainer action of this nature. See Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill. 2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).\nThe defendant also contends that the trial court erred in rendering judgment in the instant case, since the amount demanded in the 3-day notice was more than the trial court found was actually due and owing. We disagree.\nIn Provident Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Thrower, 155 Wash. 613, 617, 285 P. 654 (1930), we stated:\nAs to the form and contents of the notice or demand, a substantial compliance with the statute is sufficient.\nSee Sowers v. Lewis, 49 Wn.2d 891, 307 P.2d 1064 (1957). See also Erz v. Reese, 157 Wash. 32, 288 P. 255 (1930) (wherein we stated on page 35 that \u201cwe have never adopted the strictest rule of construction as to the form or contents of such notices under our unlawful detainer statutes, chiefly for the reason, doubtless, that the statutes prescribe no form.\u201d). In the Provident Mutual case the notice was defective in three respects: (1) It contained the signature of the agent rather than the owner; (2) it overstated the amount of rent due by $165 as found by the trial court; and (3) it defectively described the premises. Although we did not specifically address the issue of the overstatement of the amount of rent due, we did hold the notice substantially complied with the requirements of Rem. Comp. Stat. \u00a7 812 (now RCW 59.12.030).\nIn the instant case, the 3-day notice to pay rent or vacate the premises that was served upon the defendant called for the payment of $205, the balance due under the lease, plus $75 per month for July and August. There was no dispute as to the monthly rental payment under the terms of the purported lease; however, there was a conflict as to the amount of the monthly rental due for the months of July and August. The plaintiff testified the rent for those months was to be $75 per month, and the defendant testified that it was to be $50 per month. It appears that the plaintiff\u2019s demand for rental in the notice was in conformity with his good faith determination as to the amount of rental due, and that the defendant was not prejudiced as he could have tendered to the plaintiff the amount of rental due according to his understanding, of the agreement. See C. J. Peck, Landlord and Tenant Notices, 31 Wash. L. Rev. 51, 61 (1956). In tendering the amount due to the plaintiff, of"

    "Finley, C. J.\nAppellant, petitioner below, purchased a single-family dwelling and moved it to his lot in Everett. He intended to rent the house, and in preparing it for rental found it necessary to do some plumbing work therein. He applied for a permit to do the plumbing, intending to purchase the materials and do the work himself. Appellant is not a certified plumbing contractor, and made no application for such certification. The permit was denied because the plumbing he intended to do was not in a house occupied or designed to be occupied by him.\nSnohomish County has adopted the Uniform Plumbing Code, 1961 Edition, promulgated by the Western Plumbing Officials Association. The preamble to this code states that it is:\nAn ordinance providing for the protection of the public health and safety, and the qualification and registration of persons engaged in the business of plumbing, or laboring at the trade of plumbing; requiring a permit and inspection for the installation or alteration of plumbing and drainage systems ....\nSection 1.8 of said code provides that no plumbing work shall be commenced in any building without a permit. The challenged portion of the code, section 1.10, provides that no permit shall be issued for any plumbing or drainage work regulated by the code except to a person holding a valid, unexpired and unrevoked plumbing contractor\u2019s certificate of qualification.\nHowever, subsection (c) to said section 1.10 contains an exception to the certification requirement under six conditions:\n(1) When the person desires to do plumbing or drainage work in a single family dwelling;\n(2) When such dwelling is to be used exclusively for living purposes;\n(3) When the person who will do the work is the bona fide owner of the dwelling;\n(4) When the dwelling is occupied or designed to be occupied by said owner;\n(5) Provided that said owner shall personally purchase all material; and\n(6) Provided that such owner shall personally perform all labor in connection therewith.\nThe code also sets out detailed requirements for materials to be used, and for inspection and testing of all work before it is covered or hidden from view. The person doing the work is required to notify the board of plumbing inspectors when the work is ready to be inspected, and the work must meet the minimum standards set out by the code before approval will be given.\nAppellant petitioned the trial court for a writ of mandamus, requiring respondent to issue a plumbing permit to appellant. His affidavit in support of his application for the writ stated that appellant was willing to comply with the standards for plumbing set out in the code, and to have his work inspected according to the code.\nAppellant contends that since he intends to comply with the code standards, the requirement that nonresident homeowners be licensed to do plumbing on their own premises is not reasonably related to the public health, and therefore unduly restricts his lawful activities upon private property, in violation of the due process provisions of the Washington State Constitution, article 1, section 3, and in violation of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution. Appellant contends also that the classification set out in section 1.10 (c) between resident homeowners and nonresident homeowners with regard to the requirement for certification is arbitrary and unreasonable, in that it is not designed to protect the public health and safety, and therefore deprives him of equal protection of the laws, in violation of article 1, section 12 of the Washington State Constitution, and in violation of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution.\nDue Process\nThe trial court, dismissing appellant\u2019s application for writ of mandamus, held that section 1.10 of the plumbing code does not violate state or federal constitutional due process standards.\nHere on appeal, we must determine whether requiring certification or licensing of persons who desire to do plumbing work on residences which they own but do not intend to occupy, is reasonably related to the public health and safety, considering the detailed requirements set down in the plumbing code, and considering appellant\u2019s avowed intention to follow these requirements.\nIt has been long established that the police power extends to protection of the public health and safety, Tacoma v. Fox, 158 Wash. 325, 290 Pac. 1010 (1930), and that regulation of plumbing in the interest of health and safety is a valid exercise of the police power. Spokane v. Latham, 181 Wash. 161, 42 P.2d 427 (1935). Whether the facts of a particular case justify assertion of the police power is a question for the courts. Bowes v. Aberdeen, 58 Wash. 535, 109 Pac. 369 (1910); Spokane v. Latham, supra. There is a presumption that facts justifying a regulation exist if such facts reasonably can be presumed. The test when lawful activity upon private property is involved has been said to be more stringent, however. This court stated in Seattle v. Ford, 144 Wash. 107, 257 Pac. 243 (1927), that where private rights exist the courts should review the legislative action and determine whether the legislative body has imposed unnecessary restrictions upon a lawful occupation or a lawful right. In Brown v. Seattle, 150 Wash. 203, 210, 272 Pac. 517 (1928), we quoted briefly from Seattle v. Ford, supra as follows:\n\u201cThe courts will go far in sustaining the exercise of the police power for the preservation of the public health and safety, and in so doing private rights in conflict therewith are overriden; but on the other hand, the courts are equally concerned to see that, under the guise of protecting the public, private business\u2014especially that carried on upon private property\u2014is not arbitrarily restricted ....\nWe conclude that the requirement in section 1.10 for certification of nonresident homeowners is part of the total enforcement scheme of the code, and as such is reasonably related to the public health and safety. Such requirement is a valid exercise of the police power, and is not a violation of federal or state due process standards.\nThis conclusion is based upon the reasoning that a property owner who does plumbing for others, i.e. for prospective tenants or purchasers of his property, has a similar impact upon the public to a commercial plumber. He is to some extent carrying on a commercial activity since plumbing is an integral part of the property he intends to rent or sell.\nAppellant concedes that licensing of commercial plumbers is reasonably related to the public health and safety. Likewise, it must be conceded that one who does any amount of plumbing for others than himself and his immediate family, although it be more limited than that done by commercial plumbers, is in a position similar to commercial plumbers, and can be required to be certified as to requisite skills.\nAlthough one who does plumbing in a residence which he intends to rent or sell is subject to the laws of landlord-tenant, or of contract, such laws are not designed to protect the public health and safety. Nor are such laws adequate for this purpose.\nTestimony at trial indicated that some plumbing defects are extremely difficult to detect, even under the detailed inspection required by the plumbing code, and that the plumbing inspectors rely to some extent upon the skill and care of commercial plumbers. Licensed plumbers generally do better work than do nonlicensed plumbers. It is, therefore, reasonable to limit noncertified work, and even though all work must be inspected, there is a legitimate reason for the certification requirement set out in section 1.10.\nWe cannot say that there is no reasonable relation to public health and safety in the requirement that nonresident homeowners be licensed to do plumbing for others; nor can we say that appellant has been arbitrarily deprived of a lawful right.\nIt is reasonable to assume that the county, when adopting the plumbing code, had such considerations in mind when it limited the right of homeowners to plumb their own premises. Obviously the impact to the public health and safety increases with the number of homeowners who might wish to plumb their premises for rental or sale, and with the number of such premises.\nEqual Protection\nThe state and federal constitutional provisions for equal protection of the laws require that class legislation must apply alike to all persons within a class, and that reasonable grounds for the distinction must exist between those within and those without a designated class. Clark v. Dwyer, 56 Wn.2d 425, 353 P.2d 941 (1960).\nWe conclude that the trial court was correct in finding no violation of equal protection of the laws in this case.\nWe said in Clark v. Dwyer, supra, at 431:\nWhere possible, it will be presumed that the legislature has affirmatively determined any special facts requisite to the validity of the enactment, even though no legislative finding of fact appears in the statute. State ex rel. Collier v. Yelle, 9 Wn. (2d) 317, 333, 115 P. (2d) 373.\nSince it is reasonable to assume that homeowners who do plumbing work for themselves and their immediate families in residences in which they reside or intend to reside, will tend to perform the work more carefully than would those who do plumbing work for strangers, it is reasonable to require certification of the latter class while not requiring certification of the former class. The public health and safety may adequately be protected in the first case by the inherent concern one has for his own welfare and that of his immediate family. This immediate concern may not be present when strangers are to use the premises, and therefore there is no adequate substitute for the certification requirement. We find a logical connection between the object of the legisaltion, i.e., the protection of the public health and safety, and the requirement that one must intend to live in a residence himself if he is to be issued a permit to do plumbing work without first being examined as to requisite skill and certified as a plumbing contractor.\nAppellant\u2019s most telling argument is that since in any event all work must be inspected and must meet the minimum standards set out by the plumbing code, it does not matter who does the work. Appellant concedes, of course, that such reasoning does not apply to commercial plumbers who hold themselves out for hire. The additional requirement that such plumbers be licensed after passing an examination for requisite skill is reasonably related to the public health and safety.\nWe hold that the additional licensing requirement for nonresident homeowners who desire to do plumbing work for members of the public other than themselves and their immediate families is also reasonably related to the public health and safety.\nThe judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\nDonworth, Hunter, Hamilton, Hale, and Neill, JJ., concur."

    -8.658387184143066,
    "Finley, J.\nThis appeal involves a dispute between the state of Washington and Commercial Waterway District No. 1 of King county, a municipal corporation (hereinafter re- \u25a0 ferred to as the district), established under the provisions of chapter 11, Laws of 1911, p. 11 [cf. RCW 91.04.010, et seq.]. The state and the district are both claiming title or ownership to certain portions of the beds and shores of the natural channel of the Duwamish river, and the district initiated this lawsuit to. have title quieted in it.\nThe portions of the beds and shores of the Duwamish river here involved are located within the boundaries of the district and, allegedly, have been abandoned or have been ceded by the state of Washington to the waterway district pursuant to certain provisions contained in \u00a7 8, chapter 11, Laws of 1911, p. 21 [cf. RCW 91.04.200],\nAllegedly, this came about because the particular provisions of \u00a7 8 purportedly became operative \u25a0 as a result of the diversion of the Duwamish river from its former natural channel to a man-made (deepened, widened, and straightened) channel known as the Duwamish waterway. The activities or proceedings of the district which resulted in the alleged diversion of the. Duwamish river were authorized and accomplished under certain other provisions of chapter 11, Laws of 1911. The problem here involved necessitates an interpretation of the language of \u00a7 8, chapter 11, Laws of 1911, which we have italicized in quoting \u00a7 8 in full, as follows:\n\u201cAll the right, title and interest of the State of Washing-ington in and to so much of the beds and shores of any navigable river, stream, waterway or watercourse located within the boundaries of any commercial waterway district up to and including the line of ordinary high tide in waters where the tide ebbs and flows and up to and including the line of ordinary high water within the banks of any navigable rivers and lakes, to the extent that the same, under any proceedings to be had under this act, shall cease to become [be] part of such river, stream, waterway or watercourse by reason of the diversion of such river, stream, waterway or watercourse, under any proceedings had under this act, are hereby given and granted and vested in the respective commercial waterway districts now existing, or hereafter to be formed, and the commissioners of such respective commercial waterway districts are hereby given the right, power and authority to sell such beds and shores in such manner and upon such notice and proceedings as govern, under the existing laws of the state, the board of county commissioners in the sale and disposition of any real estate belonging to the counties of this state. The proceeds of such sales are to be used for the benefit of such commercial waterway districts, and the payment of any expenses connected with the construction of such commercial waterways or maintenance thereof: Provided, however, That the commissioners of such commercial waterway district may, in their discretion, exchange such abandoned beds and shores, for other property needed in the straightening, deepening or widening of such rivers, watercourses or streams, and which exchange may be made upon such terms and conditions and in such areas as, in the discretion of such commissioners, they may deem advisable and for the best interests of such commercial waterway district without any notice or other formality or proceedings whatever.\u201d (Italics ours.)\nAfter considering the evidence and hearing the arguments of counsel, the trial court interpreted \u00a7 8, chapter 11, Laws of 1911 (hereinafter referred to as \u00a7 8), in a manner that gives the water district title to the portions of the beds and shores of the river involved in this lawsuit. The state has appealed.\nAs will be inferred from the foregoing, the statute here involved, including \u00a7 8, was enacted by the 1911 legislature. The act permitted the creation of commercial waterway districts and authorized them to deepen, widen, and otherwise improve rivers, streams, waterways, and watercourses located within the boundaries of such commercial waterway districts.\nPursuant to the statute, Commercial Waterway District No. 1 was established. It adopted a plan for the improvement of the Duwamish river, and wherever necessary, by purchase and by condemnation, acquired a right of way five hundred feet wide. Pursuant to the plan, the district dredged and constructed a deeper, wider, straighter \u2014 and therefore a more navigable and more usable \u2014 man-made waterway or channel for the river.\nThe new channel or waterway was dredged (a) for a distance of approximately four and one-half miles (b) to a depth of sixteen feet below the line of extreme low tide level and (c) to a width of approximately one hundred fifty feet at its bottom, with the sides of the waterway from the bottom thereof somewhat taking their natural slope upward and outward. At some several points, for varying distances, the new, man-made waterway, or channel for the river, overlaps and follows the old or natural course of the river. At certain points, the new waterway leaves the old channel of the river, but in a relatively straight line again intersects, rejoins, or overlaps the old channel as it proceeds across the Seattle tide flats to Elliott bay.\nTo obtain a visual picture of the new waterway and its relationship to the old or natural channel of the river, it must be kept in mind that the lower stretches of the old channel of the river in its natural state followed a twisting and turning snakelike pattern for a distance of approximately twelve miles across the tide flats of south Seattle. The Duwamish waterway as constructed by the district reduces the distance now traversed by the river by several miles. As the result of the construction of the new waterway, there are a number of crescent or circular shaped slips or loops of the old channel lying on each side of the new waterway. Reference to the following map should be helpful in analyzing (a) the problem here involved and (b) our discussion of it.\nAfter the construction of the new waterway, some of the slips or loops of the former channel of the Duwamish river were filled in, and clearly ceased to be a part of the river by reason of the construction of east Marginal way, a well-known street of the city of Seattle. It is conceded that title to the portions of the former shores and bed of the river which lie east of east Marginal way has passed to the district. In other slips or loops of the original channel, which have not been filled in, the tide still ebbs and flows as it does throughout the length and breadth of the new waterway.\nThere is testimony in the record to show that at the time of mean low tide, or at other lower stages of the tide, the river flows in and is entirely contained by the new waterway. There is also some testimony in the record showing that at mean low tide level there is no tidewater and no river water or current in the slips or loops which have been left in their natural state, their depth not having been increased by dredging operations. In other slips or loops, dredging operations by adjacent owners permit tidewater to flow in a portion thereof at mean low tide. However, the district itself has never conducted dredging operations in any of the disputed slips or loops.\nThe principal point emphasized by the state seems to be that at high tide, and at other stages above mean low tide level, the tide still ebbs and flows in the slips or loops of the old channel which are located to one side or the other of the new Duwamish waterway; i.e., that the tide still ebbs and flows over the portions of the beds and banks of the old river channel which are the subjects of this litigation. From this the state contends that these slips or loops, portions of the former river channel, have not been abandoned, and that title to the same has not been vested in the district by the operative effect of \u00a7 8. It seems to us that this contention of the state, if carried to its logical conclusion, would mean that no portions of the old river bed, or of the shores thereof located within the boundaries of the district, could ever be affected by \u00a7 8, because at certain stages of the tide all such portions are affected by tidal action, except possibly those portions which were filled in to permit the construction of east Marginal way and as to which no question is raised in this lawsuit.\nThus, in effect, the state\u2019s contention would completely nullify \u00a7 8, and the action of the legislature in enacting the section would be abortive. It appears crystal clear to us that the legislature certainly contemplated that its enactment of \u00a7 8 would have some force and effect.\nWhere one interpretation renders an enactment entirely inoperative and useless, but another interpretation gives some force and effect to the action of the legislature, the courts frequently adopt the- interpretation which will give the enactment effect and will advance the purposes thereof.\nBe that as it may, we think that in the instant case the state\u2019s position is untenable and that the language of \u00a7 8 crucial to this appeal is clear and unambiguous. Its obvious purpose is to give to waterway districts the title or ownership of those portions of the beds and shores of rivers, streams, waterways, and watercourses affected by tidal action which are by-passed or abandoned as the result of activities or proceedings of the districts in straightening, deepening, and widening such rivers, streams, waterways, and watercourses located within the geographical boundaries of such districts.\nIn other words, we agree with the trial judge\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 8. Based thereon, the trial judge entered findings of fact and conclusions of law. These were to the effect that (a) the activities or proceedings of the district under the act have diverted the Duwamish river to the man-made Duwamish waterway with the result (b) that the portions of the old channel involved in this lawsuit have, in effect, been abandoned, and (c) that under the provisions of \u00a7 8, and by reason of their operative effect, title or ownership of these has become vested in the district. The foregoing findings and conclusions are supported by the evidence in the record; consequently, on appeal we will not substitute our judgment for that of the court.\nIn connection with the trial court\u2019s and our interpretation of \u00a7 8, and in supplementation and support thereof, it may be noted that \u00a7 8 authorizes waterway districts\n\u201cto sell such beds and shores\u201d or to \u201cexchange such abandoned beds and shores, for other property needed in the straightening, deepening, or widening of such rivers, watercourses or streams, and which exchange may be made upon such terms and conditions and in such areas as, in the discretion of such commissioners, they may deem advisable and for the best interests of such commercial waterway districts without any notice or other formality or proceedings whatever.\u201d\nThe purposes of these provisions is to permit waterway districts to control abandoned beds and shores of rivers or watercourses within the boundaries of such districts and to facilitate, financially and otherwise, the construction and maintenance of improvements. Such purposes are consistent with and support the interpretation we have given heretofore to the language of \u00a7 8, which is crucial to the disposition of this appeal.\nWe note that in support of its contentions the state of Washington has cited the following decisions: Hill v. Newell, 86 Wash. 227, 149 Pac. 951; Commercial Waterway Dist. No. 1 v. King County, 200 Wash. 538, 94 P. (2d) 491; Ghione v. State, 26 Wn. (2d) 635, 175 P. (2d) 955. Our analysis of these cases indicates that they are hardly pertinent and certainly not controlling as to the interpretation and effect which w.e think was contemplated by the legislature with respect to \u00a7 8.\nThe trial court entered judgment against the state for costs. In Clark v. Seiber, 49 Wn. (2d) 502, 304 P. (2d) 708, we held that costs cannot be assessed against the state except where the action is \u201cprosecuted in the name and for the use of the state,\u201d (see RCW 4.84.170), and cited Washington Recorder Pub. Co. v. Ernst, 1 Wn. (2d) 545, 97 P. (2d) 116; see, also, Ghione v. State, supra. Under the authority of these cases, we hold that the trial court erred in assessing costs against the state, and the judgment is modified accordingly.\nFor the reasons indicated hereinbefore, the judgment of the trial court, as modified relative to costs, should be affirmed.\nIt is so ordered.\nHill, C. J., Mallery, Donworth, and Ott, JJ., concur."

    "Chambers, J.\n\u2014 The 1515-1519 Lakeview Boulevard Condominium Association (homeowners) are the owners of three condominiums that were rendered uninhabitable when the soil underlying the property gave way precipitously during winter storms. The homeowners brought suit against several parties, including the City of Seattle (city). The homeowners argued the city should not have permitted the condominiums to be built due to the latent risk of soil movement, and that the city\u2019s storm drains had contributed to the slide. Before allowing the condominiums to be constructed, the city, concerned about the possibility of landslides, had imposed several conditions on the developer. These conditions included a covenant exculpating the city from liability for damages caused by soil movement. In this case, we are asked to determine whether an exculpatory covenant recorded in a deed runs with the land, and whether an action may be maintained against the city for alleged negligence in maintaining storm drains and granting permits. The trial court dismissed all claims against the city at summary judgment. The Court of Appeals agreed that the claims arising from permitting should be dismissed, but reinstated the claims arising from negligently maintained storm drains. We affirm the Court of Appeals dismissal of the negligent permitting claims (though on different grounds), affirm reinstatement of the claims relating to the storm drains, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nISSUES\n1. Does a covenant exculpating a city from liability for damages caused by soil movement run with the land?\n2. Does a city have a duty to homeowners (1) to refuse to grant a building permit when there is a known risk of significant soil movement; or (2) to exercise due care to maintain a public drain system?\nFACTS\nThis is the second case accepted for review by this Court (and the third where review was sought) arising out of the same unfortunate condominium project. These condominiums were built on a steep slope in between the city\u2019s Capitol Hill and Eastlake districts. The slope consists mostly of a permeable mixture of sand and fill resting on top of an impermeable mixture of silt and clay, a configuration that often leads to landslides.\nApartment Sales Corporation sought and received a permit from the city to build three townhouse condominiums on this site, 1515-1519 Lakeview Boulevard. The site consisted of a small, flat area and a steep slope running down to a section of freeway. Because the sites were in a potential slide area, the developers were required to obtain several zoning variances.\nIn addition to the variances, the city imposed three specific conditions before it would grant building permits. First, the developers were required to inform all purchasers of the risk of soil movement. Second, continuous insurance was required. Third, the developers were required to grant and record a covenant releasing the city from liability for damages caused by soil movement, except for damages caused by the city\u2019s sole negligence. The covenant reads in relevant part:\nWHEREAS, the property is located in a \u201cpotential slide area\u201d as defined in City of Seattle Director\u2019s Rule 2-87,[] which rule requires as a condition of the issuance of land use and construction permits that this covenant be signed, acknowledged and recorded in the records of King County; NOW, THEREFORE, Owner(s) agree(s) as follows:\n1. Owner(s) will inform his/her successors and assigns of the property described in Exhibit \u201cA\u201d that the property is in a potential slide area, of the risks associated with development thereon, of any conditions or prohibitions on development imposed by the City, and of any features in this design which will require maintenance or modification to address anticipated soils changes.\n2. Owner(s) on his/her own behalf and on behalf of his/her heirs, successors and assigns hereby waives any right to assert any claim against the City for any loss, or damage to people or property either on or off the site resulting from soil movement by reason of or arising out of the issuance of the permit(s) by the City for development on this property except only for such losses that may directly result from the sole negligence of the City.\n3. Requirements for continuous insurance as required by the permit authorizing the development.\nClerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 44-45.\nThis covenant was referenced in the Preliminary Commitment for Title Insurance for the Fukuis, owners of 1515 Lakeview Boulevard. No documentation has been supplied on the other two units; however, the other homeowners do not dispute that it was properly recorded or that they had notice.\nThe homeowners received numerous assurances from the developers that the site was stable and the homes would not slip. The homeowners\u2019 complaint alleges they were assured the units would be safe, even if the soil slid away. Lakeview was flooded at least four times between November 1992 and November 1996. In each flood, at least a foot of water inundated the garages and basements of the units. Perhaps not coincidentally, the public storm drain system overflowed each time the condominiums flooded. The homeowners provided the declaration of an engineering geologist, Mackey Smith, which stated that failures of the city-maintained public drain system permitted thousands of gallons of water to inundate the condominiums. Smith also stated that these drain overflows were a contributing cause of the soil movement. There was other evidence of infrastructure failure: in November 1996 a city inspector discovered \u201cthe pipe leading from the manhole/catch basin of the former Lakeside Boulevard alignment had separated and was blocked. . . . This break was repaired.\u201d CP at 18.\nIn late December 1996, two severe storms dumped heavy snow onto soils already at or near saturation. Rain followed, saturating the snow because it could not penetrate frozen soil beneath. Then a warm rain quickly melted the saturated snow. Between December 30, 1996 and January 1, 1997 \u201ctemperatures rose rapidly and all of the snow was melted by intense warm air. The combination of saturated soil, freezing temperatures, and snow, followed by rapid thaw and warm rain, triggered widespread flooding and landslides throughout the Puget Sound region.\u201d CP at 265.\nAll three townhouses had been occupied about four years when the sites experienced significant soil movement. At approximately 6:00 a.m. on January 3, 1997, early rising homeowners in the Lakeview complex realized they had no running water. This was because the property had moved, breaking the connection with the water main. Water was \u201c \u2018bubbling out of the ground.\u2019 \u201d CP at 19. Within a day, the property had sunk between four and six feet and had moved west two feet. The homes were rendered uninhabitable.\nThe homeowners sued the city, the developers, the geotechnical engineer, the architect, the contractor, and the structural engineer. The homeowners settled with the developers, and this Court ultimately dismissed the claim against the builders based on the statute of limitations. 1519-1525 Lakeview Blvd. Condo. Ass\u2019n v. Apartment Sales Corp., 144 Wn.2d 570, 29 P.3d 1249 (2001). The city successfully moved for summary judgment based on the covenant, assumption of the risk, and the public duty doctrine. The homeowners appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed. That court specifically found that the covenant did not run with the land, but found the negligent permitting claims were barred by the public duty doctrine. The Court of Appeals reinstated claims related to negligent maintenance of the storm drains. The city petitioned for review, which we granted.\nANALYSIS\nThis case is here on summary judgment presenting only questions of law. All questions will be reviewed de novo. Rivett v. City of Tacoma, 123 Wn.2d 573, 578, 870 P.2d 299 (1994).\nDoes the Exculpatory Language in the Deed Run With the Land?\nA. Sovereign Immunity\nWe must first decide whether the abolition of sovereign immunity, RCW 4.96.010, is violated when a local government requires, as a condition of granting a building permit, an exculpatory covenant tailored to alleviate specific concerns unique to a particular project. We hold that exculpatory covenants do not categorically violate sovereign immunity. However, blanket grants of immunity secured routinely for performance of public functions do not differ meaningfully from ordinances immunizing local governments for their own negligence, and will be invalidated under Rivett, 123 Wn.2d 573, and Employco Personnel Services, Inc. v. City of Seattle, 117 Wn.2d 606, 817 P.2d 1373 (1991). See also Howe v. Douglas County, 146 Wn.2d 183, 43 P.3d 1240 (2002). These issues will not be substantially revisited here.\nThe city contends innovative land use instruments, such as exculpatory covenants, should be encouraged because the Growth Management Act, chapter 36.70A RCW, is channeling development onto more and more marginal lots. The city is also concerned that if it denies building permits, it runs the risk of committing regulatory takings or inverse condemnation, as well as potentially frustrating the laudable goals of the Growth Management Act. The city argues that requiring the release and requiring the developers to have insurance and inform subsequent purchasers of the danger is a fair way to allow development. This argument suggests that property owners of land marginal for development because of the composition, topography, location, or other characteristic of the property should be free to propose creative solutions, and accept the risks of development.\nWe hold that a local government and a property owner may reach an arms-length, bargained-for agreement which may include waivers of liability for risks created by the proposed use of property because of the shape, composition, location or other characteristic unique to the property sought to be developed. Here we find that the exculpatory language of the covenant was tailored to the specific risks presented by the proposed development of the property and appropriately limited in scope to the danger of soil movement. Therefore it does not violate this State\u2019s abolition of sovereign immunity by functionally enacting blanket immunity.\nB. Enforceability of the Covenant against Successive Owners\nThe homeowners argue that this covenant may not be enforced against them on the theory exculpatory waivers do not \u201crun with the land\u201d and therefore cannot bind successors in interest. Accordingly, we turn now to the requirements for a covenant to run/\nCovenants are deeply rooted in our law, dating at least to the 14th century. Restatement (Third) of Prop: Servitudes, Introduction at 5 (2000). The seminal Spencer\u2019s Case, 77 Eng. Rep. 72 (Q.B. 1583) established the general requirements. Spencer\u2019s Case involved a covenant by a tenant to build a wall. The tenant covenanted on behalf of himself and his executors, administrators, and assigns to build a brick wall on a leased lot. After executing the covenant, the tenant assigned the property to another. The new tenant refused to build the wall. \u2018Although there is some doubt from the report as to who won, the case is famous because the judges laid down three propositions about the running of the burden of covenants.\u201d Jesse Dukeminier & James E. Krier, Property 856 (3d ed. 1993). There must be intent to bind successors, the obligation must touch and concern the land, and there must be privity of estate. Id. Otherwise, the \u201ccovenant\u201d is merely a contract and will not bind future possessors of the land. William B. Stoebuck, Running Covenants: An Analytical Primer, 52 Wash. L. Rev. 861, 863-64 (1977). Through much of their history, the requirements for a covenant to run varied depending on whether it was \u201creal\u201d (developed and enforced in courts of law) or \u201cequitable\u201d (developed and enforced in the Chancery). However, the distinctions have largely vanished from our law. See Hollis v. Garwall, Inc., 137 Wn.2d 683, 690, 974 P.2d 836 (1999).\nGenerally, there are five elements required for a covenant to run:\n(1) a promise which is enforceable between the original parties;\n(2) which touches and concerns; (3) which the parties intended to bind successors; and (4) which is sought to be enforced by an original party or a successor, against an original party or a successor in possession; (5) who has notice of the covenant or has not given value.\nStoebuck, supra, at 909-10. Four of these elements are not seriously disputed by the parties before this Court. The issue before us is whether an exculpatory covenant touches and concerns the land.\nProfessor Stoebuck noted:\nIf there ever was a rule that a running covenant had to touch and concern land in a physical sense, it has long since been abandoned in America. The most that can be said concerning American doctrine is that the meaning of touch and concern tends to become less clear as physical contact becomes less direct.\nStoebuck, supra, at 870 (footnote omitted). This Court has not adopted a strict test for \u201ctouch and concern\u201d; instead, we have established an analytical approach:\n\u201c \u2018Generally speaking, a covenant touches or concerns the land if it is such as to benefit the grantor or the lessor, or the grantee or lessee, as the case may be. As the term implies, the covenant must concern the occupation or enjoyment of the land granted or demised and the liability to perform it, and the right to take advantage of it must pass to the assignee. Conversely, if the covenant does not touch or concern the occupation or enjoyment of the land, it is the collateral and personal obligation of the grantor or lessor and does not run with the land.\u2019 \u201d\nRodruck v. Sand Point Maint. Comm\u2019n, 48 Wn.2d 565, 574-75, 295 P.2d 714 (1956) (quoting City of Seattle v. Fender, 42 Wn.2d 213, 218, 254 P.2d 470 (1953) (quoting Pelser v. Gingold, 214 Minn. 281, 8 N.W.2d 36, 39 (1943))). It is an open question whether a covenant warning of risk and exculpating liability for that risk touches and concerns the land. The only court to reach whether such covenant would run held, without analysis of touch and concern, that it did run. Phillips v. Altman, 1966 OK 46, 412 P.2d 199 (holding that a covenant not to sue for damages arising from oil and gas pollution ran with the land and was not void as against public policy).\nThe city relies upon Hollis, 137 Wn.2d at 690 to support an argument that this Court has abandoned the requirement of \u201ctouch and concern.\u201d Hollis does not extend so far. Hollis was limited to mutual covenants in a subdivision. The requirements for covenants running in subdivisions have been relaxed compared to covenants running in other contexts; it is even possible for covenants to be enforced against those who have no covenant appearing on their title. See Stoebuck, supra, at 908-10; see also 17 William B. Stoebuck, Washington Practice, Real Estate: Property Law \u00a7 3.2, at 127-28 (1995). Further, this Court was not considering in Hollis generalized rules governing covenants; instead, the argument focused on whether the liberalized parole evidence rule of Berg v. Hudesman, 115 Wn.2d 657, 801 P.2d 222 (1990) applied to covenants. This Court has not relaxed the touch and concern requirement for the enforceability of covenants in settings other than subdivisions and we decline to do so now.\nWe conclude that this covenant satisfies the touch and concern doctrine as used in this State. Read as a whole, the covenant burdens the use of land, since the covenant is limited to the reasonable enjoyment of the land and limits rights normally associated with ownership. Further, few things touch and concern land more than the soil itself. This is sufficient to meet the requirements of Rodruck. The city is exculpated for losses that are not caused by the city\u2019s own negligence arising from soil movement, as reasonably contemplated by the parties to the covenant. Therefore, we hold that this covenant runs with the land.\nNEGLIGENCE\nA. Negligent Permitting Claim\nWhile not raised to this Court, given our disposition of the issues we will briefly address whether the city, when granting a permit to the developers, had a duty to future homeowners enforceable in tort. We hold it did not. Alleged negligent permitting alone cannot be the basis of a negligence claim against local government, absent a recognized exception. See Howe, 146 Wn.2d 183; Taylor v. Stevens County, 111 Wn.2d 159, 759 P.2d 447 (1988). Homeowners have not established that they fall within a recognized exception. Therefore, we affirm both the trial court and the Court of Appeals dismissal of this claim.\nB. City\u2019s Duty to Maintain Drainage System\nThe trial court dismissed the negligent maintenance claims against the city, finding they were barred by the public duty doctrine. The trial court granted summary judgment to the city on this claim. The Court of Appeals reversed.\nThe homeowners contend the city\u2019s storm drain system had been negligently maintained, and that negligence proximately caused the land to slide. They pleaded facts tending to show that they fall within the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d exception to the public duty doctrine. To fall within the special relationship exception on their negligent maintenance claim, the homeowners must establish: \u201c(1) there is direct contact or privity between the public official and the injured plaintiff which sets the latter apart from the general public, and (2) there are express assurances given by a public official, which (3) gives rise to justifiable reliance on the part of the plaintiff.\u201d Taylor, 111 Wn.2d at 166.\nThe homeowners also contend that negligent maintenance occurred both to the drainage system on the developed site and off of the developed site. According to the homeowners, the drainage system for the Lakeview property had two components: foundation drains channeling water from the foundation area into a storm sewer system, and lines conducting water from the downspouts off site. The homeowners submitted facts tending to show that the drainage system was built so that it was not tightly lined into the storm sewer system but connected to an infiltration gallery. Instead of taking the surface water away from the site, it introduced the water to the area of the foundation. The defective drainage system was apparently buried before it was inspected by a representative of the city.\nThe Fukuis filed a claim with the city for flood damage, and were compensated. Aware of the drainage problems, the city installed catch basins in front of the Fukui residence. Ms. Fukui submitted an affidavit saying she relied on assurances from the city that it would maintain the storm drains. She has demonstrated, sufficient to defeat a claim for summary judgment, direct contact, express assurances, and justifiable reliance. She falls within the special relationship exception with regards to damages occasioned by actual negligence in maintaining the storm drain system. Therefore, we affirm the Court of Appeals reversal of the trial court\u2019s dismissal of this claim and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nCONCLUSION\nIn summary, we conclude the city is not liable for negligently granting a permit to build on this site. We also hold the exculpatory covenant is valid to the extent it releases the city from liability resulting from soil movement \u201cresulting from . . . the issuance of the permit.\u201d The covenant does not, and may not, exculpate the city for soil movement-related losses caused by the city\u2019s own negligence. The homeowners may pursue claims against the city arising out of negligent maintenance of the storm and water drain system. Accordingly, we reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nAlexander, C.J., and Smith, Johnson, Madsen, Sanders, Ireland, Bridge, and Owens, JJ., concur.\nNo argument about the constitutionality or legality of this rule was made at an"

    "Hamilton, J.\nPlaintiff, King County, appeals from a summary judgment granted in favor of defendants, The Boeing Company (hereafter referred to as Boeing) and Isaacson Iron Works (hereafter referred to as Isaacson).\nThe suit between the parties revolves about drainage of surface waters from the southerly portion of the King County Airport, also known as Boeing Field. There is no substantial dispute as to the facts. The parties disagree as to the governing legal principles.\nIn 1911, Commercial Waterway District No. 1 of King County (hereafter referred to as the district) was formed, pursuant to Laws of 1911, chapter 11, p. 11, RCW 91.04.010, et seq. The purpose of the district was to straighten, widen, and dredge the natural course of the Duwamish River, a navigable stream, which flowed northwesterly into Elliott Bay, and to make thereof a ship canal or man-made waterway. In 1913, the district began construction of the canal, which is now known as the Duwamish Waterway. At several points, this waterway intersected and followed the old or natural thread of the river, then left the course of the river in a straight line to the next point of intersection. About 1916, the waterway was completed and the river was diverted from its natural channel and has since flowed in the waterway. By reason of this diversion, substantial portions of the natural channel of the river were bypassed and abandoned, leaving a number of crescent or oxbow loops lying on both sides of the waterway, the title to which vested in the district. The abandoned portions of the river lying east of the waterway and west of East Marginal Way are referred to as \u201cslips\u201d. There are seven such slips, all of which now have been sold by the district. The abandoned portions of the river channel lying east of East Marginal Way, between Slips 4 and 5, were sold by the district to King County, filled, and now lie beneath the airport.\nThe following map portrays the area between Slips 4 and 5, including the waterway, the airport area, and the abandoned portions of the river lying east and west of East Marginal Way. The superimposed arrows indicate the original direction of the river\u2019s flow. All but 900 feet of Slip 5 has heretofore been filled.\nBefore and after construction of the waterway and the airport, surface waters drained naturally in a northerly and westerly direction. The present runways of the airport are at a grade of .38 per cent from south to north. Before and after construction, the waters of the river and the waterway were affected by the ebb and flow of the tides in Elliott Bay. When the tides are in, the unfilled portion of Slip 5 is flooded. When the tides go out, Slip 5 drains westerly into the waterway.\nIn 1943, the airport was owned and operated by the United States Government, during which time a drainage system was installed. By this system, the surface waters upon the southerly portion of the airport are collected in an elaborate system of underground pipe and catch basins, and then pumped, by a series of six pumps, westerly through a 4-foot drain pipe that runs beneath East Marginal Way, several railroad tracks, and some buildings located on property belonging to Isaacson. The terminus or outfall of this drain discharges the surface waters pumped through it into the remaining 900 feet of Slip 5, from whence it flows into the waterway.\nThis drainage system was constructed without the knowledge or consent of the district, which then owned Slip 5. In 1947, Isaacson granted a 12-foot easement over its property, conforming to the route of the existing drain pipe.\nThe United States Government sought an easement through Slip 5, which was refused by the district.\nIn 1956, the district sold Slip 5 to Isaacson and Boeing\u2019s predecessor. Isaacson now owns the northerly portion of Slip 5 and Boeing the southerly portion. Both Isaacson and Boeing own land adjacent to their respective portions of the slip.\nThe present dispute arose when Isaacson commenced filling its portion of Slip 5 with impervious material to bring it to the level of its adjacent property. It is undisputed that if Isaacson and Boeing fill Slip 5 the existing drainage system for the southerly portion of the airport will be blocked and, unless remedied, the airport flooded.\nIsaacson offers an easement through Slip 5 to permit extension by King County of its drain pipe. King County consents to extension of its pipe by defendants. Herein lies the core of the controversy: Who shall pay for extension of the drain pipe through Slip 5?\nKing County commenced this action, seeking to enjoin the filling of Slip 5. A temporary restraining order was issued ex parte. Issue was joined and a motion for summary judgment interposed. The trial court, upon the basis of the undisputed facts, as presented by the pleadings and affidavits submitted, concluded King County had no legal right to discharge surface waters from the airport into Slip 5, the property of Isaacson and Boeing, and dissolved the temporary restraining order.\nKing County, on appeal, makes five assignments of error, which by argument are reduced to two basic contentions: (a) Slip 5 is a natural water or drainage course, and (b) Isaacson and Boeing are estopped from interfering with or obstructing the existing drainage system.\nKing County\u2019s contentions must be considered against the backdrop of the following applicable principles, which we consider established by previous decisions of this court:\n(1) The bypassed and abandoned portions of the bed and shores of the Duwamish River ceased to be a part of the Duwamish river, waterway, or watercourse, and title thereto, with the power of alienation, vested in Commercial Waterway District No. 1.

(2d) 178; RCW 91.04.170, 91.04.200.\n(2) Surface waters are ordinarily those vagrant or diffused waters produced by rain, melting snow, or springs. Alexander v. Muenscher, 7 Wn. (2d) 557, 110 P. (2d) 625.\n(3) A natural watercourse, insofar as riparian rights be concerned, and as related in appropriate instances to drainage rights, is defined as a channel, having a bed, banks or sides, and a current in which waters, with some regularity, run in a certain direction. Geddis v. Parrish, 1 Wash. 587, 21 Pac. 314; Tierney v. Yakima Cy., 136 Wash. 481, 239 Pac. 248; In re Johnson Creek, 159 Wash. 629, 294 Pac. 566; DeRuwe v. Morrison, 28 Wn. (2d) 797, 184 P.

(2d) 887.\n(4) Surface waters are to be regarded as outlaw or common enemy waters, against which every proprietor of land may defend himself, even to the consequent injury of others. Cass v. Dicks, 14 Wash. 75, 44 Pac. 113; Harvey v. Northern Pac. R. Co., 63 Wash. 669, 116 Pac. 464; Wood v. Tacoma, 66 Wash. 266, 119 Pac. 859; Thorpe v. Spokane, supra; Miller v. Eastern R. & Lbr.

(2d) 204.\n(5) Surface waters may not be artificially collected and discharged upon adjoining lands in quantities greater than, or in a manner different from, the natural flow thereof. Noyes v. Cosselman, 29 Wash. 635, 70 Pac. 61; Sullivan v. Johnson, 30 Wash. 72, 70 Pac. 246; Peters v. Lewis, 33 Wash. 617, 74 Pac. 815; Holloway v. Geck, 92 Wash. 153, 158 Pac. 989; Whiteside v.

(2d) 451.\n(7) The doctrine of estoppel will not be readily extended when the effect thereof is to divest an estate in real property. Finley v. Finley, 43 Wn. (2d) 755, 264 P. (2d) 246, 42 A.L.R. (2d) 1379.\nKing County first contends that Slip 5 was originally and is presently a natural watercourse or drainway for properties lying east of East Marginal Way. Among the reasons asserted in support of this contention is that the flux and reflux of the tide caused waters within the old channel, and now causes waters within Slip 5, to flow both east and west.\nWe cannot agree with King County\u2019s contention for three reasons. First, it is undisputed that the natural current and flow of the original Duwamish River through that portion of its channel which is now known as Slip 5 was in an easterly direction. Second, the normal and natural drainage of surface waters from the properties lying east of East Marginal Way was originally and is presently north and northwesterly, rather than westerly toward Slip 5. And, third, the ebb and flow of the tides in either the Duwamish River, the Duwamish Waterway, or Slip 5, in nowise alters the natural drainage direction of surface waters from surrounding properties.\nIn short, absent consent of the proprietors, King County has no legal right to artificially collect and discharge surface waters upon or into Slip 5 in quantities greater than, or in a manner different from, the natural flow of such surface waters.\nKing County next contends Isaacson and Boeing are estopped from interfering with or obstructing discharge of waters into Slip 5 from the existing drainage system. This contention is premised upon King County\u2019s assertion that (a) Commercial Waterway District No. 1, as common grantor of the abandoned portions of the Duwamish River channel, rendered necessary artificial drainage of the airport properties by construction of the Duwamish Waterway; (b) by its grant of an easement through its property, in 1947, Isaacson acquiesced and consented to the construction and maintenance of the artificial drainage system discharging into Slip 5; and (c) Boeing, through its predecessors in interest, including Commercial Waterway District No. 1, and Isaacson, as a tenant in common, is bound by the visible use and patent necessity of Slip 5 as a drainway.\nWe find no merit in King County\u2019s contention. It has cited no authority, and we have found none, erecting, by operation of law, an extension of an easement such as is here sought under the circumstances here present. The record is devoid of any fact from which it might be inferred that King County, or its predecessor in interest, the United States Government, relied upon the actions of Commercial Waterway District No. 1, the Isaacson grant of easement, or the conduct of Boeing, or its predecessors in interest, as according any easement beyond the outfall of the existing drainage system. In fact, the record indicates without dispute that King County\u2019s predecessor in interest frankly recognized the necessity for acquiring easement rights through Slip 5, and failed in its efforts to perfect such rights. We do not attribute to King County a lesser knowledge.\nThe judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\nOtt, C. J., Donworth, Finley, and Weaver, JJ., concur.\nCommercial Waterway Dist. No. 1 of King Cy. v. State, 50 Wn. (2d) 335, 311 P. (2d) 680."

    "Rosellini, J.\nThe plaintiffs in these actions own and operate business properties in the vicinity of First avenue south and Yesler way, in Seattle. On January 17, 1954, a twenty-inch cast iron water main owned, maintained and operated by the defendant city burst at the intersection of First avenue and Yesler way and flooded the properties of the plaintiffs. Their suits against the city were consolidated and tried to the court, which found that the negligence of the city was not proved. The cause of the break of the water main was not shown. The court concluded that the city was liable, regardless of fault, and entered judgments in favor of the plaintiffs.\nThe case is before this court on the findings of fact. According to these findings, the pipe in question was laid in the year 1890, and was designed to last one hundred years; it was manufactured according to the best known engineering methods; was installed in accordance with good engineering practices; was laid upon an adequate foundation in original ground; and was subsequently covered over with a fill to a depth of approximately 6.8 feet. Portions of the pipe were inspected whenever they were exposed for other purposes and were found to be in reasonably good condition. The water was shut off as soon as possible after - the break occurred. The pipe was strong enough to stand th\u00e9 pressure exerted upon it at the time of the break and was within the standard specifications. The cause of the break was unknown.\nThe finding of fact most pertinent to this appeal reads as follows:\n\u201cNo negligent act on the part of the city has been shown. The break of the water main in question does not ordinarily occur unless some person connected with manufacture, installation or operation has been at fault. The defendant city has endeavored, insofar as reasonably possible to determine the cause of the break, and such investigation so far as it has gone has shown that the city acted with due care in the operations examined.\u201d\nIt is the contention of the appellant that the doctrine enunciated in Rylands v. Fletcher, L. R. 1 Exch. 265, decided in 1866, and affirmed two years later in Fletcher v. Rylands, L. R. 3 H. L. 330, upon which the trial court based its decision, should not be applied to the facts of this case. The defendant in that case had caused a reservoir to be constructed on his land to provide water for his mill. The water seeped through an abandoned mine shaft into the plaintiff\u2019s mine, causing damage. Justice Blackburn, speaking for the Court of Exchequer Chamber, said:\n\u201cThe person who for his own purposes brings on his lands and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, must keep it in at his peril, and,, if he does not do so, is prima facie answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape. He can excuse himself by showing that the escape was owing to the plaintiff\u2019s default; or perhaps that the escape was the consequence of vis major, or the act of God; but as nothing of this sort exists here, it is unnecessary to inquire what excuse would be sufficient. The general rule, as above stated, seems on principle just. The person whose grass or corn is eaten down by the escaping cattle of his neighbour, or whose mine is flooded by the water from his neighbour\u2019s reservoir, or whose cellar is invaded by the filth of his neighbour\u2019s privy, or whose habitation is made unhealthy by the fumes and noisome vapours of his neighbour\u2019s alkali works, is damnified without any fault of his own; and it seems but reasonable and just that the neighbour, who has brought something on his own property which was not naturally there, harmless to others so long as it is confined to his own property, but which he knows to be mischevious if it gets on his neighbour\u2019s, should be obliged to make good the damage which ensues if he does not succeed in confining it to his own property. But for his act in bringing it there no mischief could have accrued, and it seems but just that he should at his peril keep it there so that no mischief may accrue, or answer for the natural and anticipated consequences. And upon authority, this we think is established to be the law whether the things so brought be beasts, or water, or filth, or stenches.\u201d\nThis court has applied the doctrine in cases where harm has befallen a plaintiff as a result of blasting operations carried on by the defendant. Foster v. Preston Mill Co., 44 Wn. (2d) 440, 268 P. (2d) 645 (strict liability limited to the risks inherent in blasting operations); Patrick v. Smith, 75 Wash. 407, 134 Pac. 1076; Schade Brewing Co. v. Chicago, Milwaukee & Puget Sound R. Co., 79 Wash. 651, 140 Pac. 897. We have found no case in this jurisdiction where liability has been .imposed upon a municipal corporation,, regardless of fault, for damage resulting from a broken water main.\nThe respondents call our attention to the case of Bridgeman-Russell Co. v. Duluth, 158 Minn. 509, 197 N. W. 971, wherein the doctrine of Rylands v. Fletcher, supra, was applied in favor of a plaintiff whose property had been damaged as a result of a bursting water main. In choosing to align itself with the courts which have approved the doctrine (admittedly a minority), the court in that case said:\n\u201cIf a break occurs in the reservoir itself, or in the principal mains, the flood may utterly ruin an individual financially. In such a case, even though the negligence be absent, natural justice would seem to demand that the enterprise, or what really is the same thing, the whole community benefited by the enterprise, should stand the loss rather than the individual. It is too heavy a burden upon one. The trend of modern legislation is to relieve the individual from the mischance of business or industry without regard to its being caused by negligence.\u201d\nThose courts which oppose the application of the doctrine generally adopt the theory that the imposition of liability without fault discourages enterprise and the most beneficial use of property.\nWhether the doctrine of Rylands v. Fletcher, supra, should properly be applied to cases of this nature is \u00e1 question which we need not decide at this time, since the decision of the trial court can be upheld on another ground, namely, that, under the findings, the defendant failed to sustain the burden of explaining the cause of the break in the main or showing its own freedom from negligence.\nIn its memorandum decision, the court indicated that it felt that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur was applicable, but that, under the rule as applied in the courts of this state, the presumption of negligence\n\u201c. . . merely supplied a presumption which enabled plaintiffs to get past a nonsuit, and that it could not take the place of evidence, nor be weighed against defendant\u2019s showing that it was free from negligence.\u201d\nIf this were not the case, the court indicated, it would have found the city liable under that doctrine. The court\u2019s ultimate finding on the city\u2019s negligence, or freedom from negligence, was that the city\u2019s investigation, \u201cso far as it has gone, has shown that the city acted with due care in the operations examined.\u201d The city, in other words, had shown it was free of negligence in the operations examined, but it had not yet discovered the cause of the break nor had it shown that it was free of negligence in regard to that cause.\nWhere a plaintiff\u2019s evidence establishes that an instrumentality under the exclusive control of the defendants caused an injurious occurrence, which ordinarily does not happen if those in control of the instrumentality use ordinary care, there is an inference, permissible from the occurrence itself, that it was caused by the defendant\u2019s want of care. Nopson v. Wockner, 40 Wn. (2d) 645, 245 P. (2d) 1022. Legal control or responsibility for the proper and efficient functioning of the instrumentality which caused the injury and a superior, if not exclusive, position for knowing or obtaining knowledge of the facts which caused the injury, provide a sufficient basis for application of the doctrine. Hogland v. Klein, 49 Wn. (2d) 216, 298 P. (2) 1099. When these circumstances are shown, the plaintiff has made a prima facie case, and it devolves upon the defendant to produce evidence to meet and offset the effect of the presumption. Hogland v. Klein, supra.\nHere, the water main was under the exclusive control of the defendant city, and the court found as a fact that a break of this sort does not ordinarily occur without the presence of negligence. It further found that the defendant had failed to explain the occurrence, and although it found that the defendant had exercised due care in many respects, the findings reveal that the defendant\u2019s evidence fell short of proving its freedom from negligence in regard to the break. It is evident, when the memorandum opinion is read in the light of the findings, that had the court had in mind the proper rule \u2014 that the inference of negligence is evidence to be weighed against the defendant\u2019s evidence \u2014 it would have based its decision on the premise that the inference to be drawn from the fact that the break occurred, outweighed the defendant\u2019s evidence of due care. This being the case, the judgments are affirmed.\nSchwellenbach, Donworth, Ott, and Foster, JJ., concur. \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u25a0\u25a0'\nMallery, J., dissents."

    "Rosellini, J.\nThe plaintiff recovered judgment in the trial court in the amount of three thousand dollars, the court having found that the defendant city had taken her property for public use and was maintaining a nuisance thereon, causing damage to her house. The city has appealed, assigning error to all of the material findings and conclusions.\nThe testimony showed that the home now owned by the plaintiff was built in the year 1911 over a gully or ravine, which is the east branch of Sylvia creek and is a natural drainage for certain portions of the city of Montesano. In the year 1913, the city of Montesano embarked upon a street building program whereby the grade of certain streets was brought up to level and new streets were constructed. Included in this project was Seventh street, which crossed this branch of Sylvia creek fifty feet east of the plaintiff\u2019s property, which was then owned by one Mitchell Zvono. One lot intervened between this property and Seventh street. We will refer to this lot hereafter as the Bogdanovich property and to the plaintiff\u2019s property as the Papac property.\nIn grading Seventh street, the city placed a tile drain pipe in the creek bed and filled the ravine to bring the street up to level. The fill was extended over the Bogdanovich property; and apparently some fill was also placed on the Papac property, although there was no direct evidence that this was done by the city. The then owner of the Bogdanovich property placed a tile drain, or culvert, under the fill, connecting with the city\u2019s culvert at Seventh street.\nIn its street improvement program, the city graded Fourth street three blocks east of Seventh. Mitchell Zvono testified that this increased the flow of water into the natural drainage of the east branch of Sylvia creek. This testimony was contradicted by an engineer who testified for the defendant. The trial court found that the grading of Fourth street almost doubled the flow of water in the east branch of Sylvia creek.\nWhen the plaintiff\u2019s house was built in 1911, a cedar plank culvert, which was sufficient to take care of the natural flow of water under the house, was built across the Papac property.\nIn 1916, Zvono and Papac, who later became the plaintiff\u2019s husband and is now deceased, left Montesano for Montana and Alaska. When Zvono returned in 1919, he found a large hole in the fill. He complained to the mayor, who referred him to what he described as the \u201cditch committee.\u201d The old culvert was replaced by the city with a culvert made of fir planking, and the hole was filled. In 1933, the city, through a public works project, replaced the fir culvert with two twelve-inch used city water pipes, which were made of wood and wrapped with wire.\nThe Papacs were deeded a one-half interest in the property in 1920, and the remaining interest in 1930.\nSometime between 1946 and 1948, a break occurred in one of the drain pipes. The pipes have since rotted out, and the house has deteriorated rapidly. The planks in the basement (constructed sometime between 1930 and 1940) have rotted, molded, and become termite-ridden, and the house has shifted on its foundation. The evidence regarding the causative factors was conflicting; but the trial court found that the damage was caused by the water overflowing from the rotted drain pipes. There was testimony that during the rainy season the ground is wet under the house, due to the fact that the water flows outside the pipes.\nThe city has no easement across the Papac property. There was no evidence that the work done there was authorized by the city council or that similar work had been done on other private property. Neither was there any evidence that the placing of a drain across the Papac property would benefit the public.\nThe trial court found that the damage in 1919 to the original culvert was due to the fill work and the increased flow of water, and that from that date the city assumed the burden of maintaining the culvert. The court concluded that the city, by allowing diverted drainage waters to flow uncontrolled over the plaintiff\u2019s land, is maintaining a public nuisance, which should be abated. It ordered the abatement of the nuisance either by the construction of adequate drainage across the plaintiff\u2019s property or by diverting the flow of water away from the property.\nThere is no question but that the gully over which the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor built his house is a natural drainage system, and there is nothing in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the flow of water in this gully was almost doubled by the grading of Fourth street. An engineer called by the defendant testified that the land east of Fourth street is lower than the grade of the street and that water would tend to drain east of the street as well as west. Zvono testified that there had always been drainage from east of Fourth street, but that it had increased after the street was graded. He did not attempt to say how much the flow had increased. There was no evidence that the increased flow would tend to cause a wooden culvert to rot. On the other hand, there was testimony by several witnesses for both parties that rotting is caused by the alternate moistening and drying out of wood, a condition which occurs as a result of the wet and dry seasons. We will assume, however, that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the flow of water was substantially increased and that it caused the wooden pipes to deteriorate more rapidly than they otherwise would have. The defendant maintains that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for such damage is barred by the statute of limitations.\nWhere property is taken or damaged in the exercise of the power of eminent domain, the three-year statute of limitations applies. Gillam v. Centralia, 14 Wn. (2d) 523, 128 P. (2d) 661. The damaging of land by the construction of a street or highway, causing it to be flooded by surface waters, is a taking and damaging, within the meaning of Art. I, \u00a7 16 (amendment 9) of the constitution. Harkoff v. Whatcom County, 40 Wn. (2d) 147, 241 P. (2d) 932; Ulery v. Kitsap County, 188 Wash. 519, 63 P. (2d) 352. The period of limitation begins to run when the project causing the damage is completed if substantial damage has already occurred (Gillam v. Centralia, supra), or when the first substantial injury is sustained. See Jacobs v. Seattle, 100 Wash. 524, 171 Pac. 662. If the injury is permanent, the measure of damages is generally the difference between the market value of the property immediately before, and immediately after, the damage; if it is temporary, the measure of damages is generally the cost of reconstruction, with compensation for loss of use in a proper case. Harkoff v. Whatcom County, supra.\nIt is apparent that the first substantial damage, occasioned by the regrading of Fourth street and the placing of the fill on the Papac property, occurred sometime prior to 1919. Whether the placing of the fill be regarded as a tortious invasion (in which case the three-year statute would apply, under the provisions of Rem. Rev. Stat. (Sup.), \u00a7 159 [cf. RCW 4.16.080]) or a taking or damaging under the power of eminent domain, any cause of action based thereon is long since barred. Furthermore, it appears from the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in title, Zvono, that any damage resulting from these actions was compromised and settled when the city replaced the pipe and restored the fill, and this work was accepted as satisfactory.\nIf the plaintiff has a cause of action against the city now, it must be based upon an undertaking by the city to maintain the drain pipes across the Papac property. It was upon this theory that the trial court acted when it awarded the damages claimed by the plaintiff.\nIn this regard, it must be borne in mind that this is not a case where it is claimed that the city has dammed up, or obstructed, the natural flow of water. The witnesses testified that the water flows freely through the culvert under Seventh street and the tile, or concrete, culvert constructed by the adjoining owners on their property. The complaint is that the wooden pipes which the city placed across the Papac property in 1933 (as a replacement of the deteriorated wooden culvert placed there by the city in 1919, which replaced the original culvert built by the owner)' have deteriorated and broken down, so that the water flows through its natural course outside the pipes rather than inside them, with the result that the timbers of the house are exposed to the flowing water.\nCases such as Ronkosky v. Tacoma, 71 Wash. 148,128 Pac. 2, cited by the plaintiff, are therefore not in point. The Ronkosky case dealt with the liability of \u00e1 city which had caused a culvert and fill to be constructed on one of its streets and had allowed the culvert to become obstructed, causing the plaintiff\u2019s property to be flooded and destroyed. We held that where a street is improved across a natural water course, it is incumbent upon the municipality not only to make an adequate bridge culvert or passage for the water in the first instance, but to keep it in such condition that it shall not obstruct the stream thereafter. It was this duty which the city of Montesano performed when it improved Seventh street, placed the culvert beneath it to carry the natural flow of water, and kept the culvert free of obstruction.\nThe plaintiff urges that the rule stated in 38 Am. Jur. 342, \u00a7 637, is applicable here. This section reads:\n\u201cIn the application of the principles governing municipal liability for injuries resulting from defects or obstructions in sewers, discussed in the preceding section, it is immaterial whether the actual construction of the sewer was done by the municipality or by a private individual, if it is under control of the municipality at the time. Moreover, the municipality is liable regardless of where the sewer is constructed, whether upon municipal property or private property., The fact that the particular drain may be a natural watercourse rather than an artificial construction does not alter the rule of municipal liability for damage resulting from obstructions, so long as the sewer or drain has been adopted by the municipality for drainage purposes and it has assumed control over it. The fact that the damage results from an extraordinary rainfall does not relieve the municipality from liability if the damage would not have resulted but for the obstruction, or if the obstruction contributed to the injury.\u201d (Italics ours.)\nCity of Fort Wayne v. Coombs, 107 Ind. 75, 7 N. E. 743, 57 Am. Rep. 82, is cited as authority for the italicized portion of the above quotation. The court held in that case that the city was within its rights when it constructed a sewer under its highway, even though the highway crossed a privately-owned canal; and the city was liable for its negligence in constructing the sewer.\nThe drainage system involved in this action is not upon a public highway, and the city has acquired no easement across the private property involved. In her testimony, the plaintiff made it plain that she had refused to allow the city to replace the culvert until it had paid her damages, certainly an indication that she did not regard the culvert as being under the control of the city.\nThe laying of the culvert underneath Seventh street was, of course, necessary to the improvement of the street, but it did not constitute an adoption of the natural waterway as a municipal drainage system. The record is silent as to the circumstances attending the laying of the pipes on the Papac property in 1933, and there is nothing to indicate that it was done as a part of a general improvement of the natural drainage system. This case is therefore distinguishable from the Indiana case cited in 38 Am. Jur., supra.\nLikewise, the cases cited in 18 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d. ed.), 467, \u00a7 53.118' (in support of the author\u2019s statement that where a municipality assumes control and management of a sewer or drainage system, it is immaterial by whom the system was constructed) involve facts very different from those we are dealing with here and cannot control our decision.\nThis court has held that the power given to cities by statute (RCW 35.21.090, Rem. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 9355), to construct dikes or improve natural water courses, is confined to public purposes; and a city is not authorized to put in a culvert on private property to keep open a nonnavigable natural watercourse which has become obstructed by private culverts and the failure of private owners to properly maintain the same. Wiley v. Aberdeen, 123 Wash. 539, 212 Pac. 1049. Here, as in that case, no public purpose was shown. The plaintiff merely contends that by placing the culvert on her property, the city assumed the duty of maintaining it. No authority is offered for this proposition. Wiley v. Aberdeen is directly contrary, as is Woodward v. Seattle, 140 Wash. 83, 248 Pac. 73, wherein we held that a city is not liable for injuries resulting from an ultra vires act, that is, for an act performed outside the scope of its statutory authority.\nThe plaintiff cites Sigurdson v. Seattle, 48 Wn. (2d) 155, 292 P. (2d) 214, as controlling the issue presented here. In the Sigurdson case, a drain had been constructed on county property by the WPA, and its maintenance had been assumed by the city. A break occurred in the drain, above the plaintiff\u2019s property, causing the hillside on which it was located to become saturated with water, which resulted in a landslide that severely damaged the plaintiff\u2019s property. We held that the drain was maintained for a public purpose, since without it the area constituted a hazard to the city streets; that if any private benefit resulted from the maintenance of the drain, it was only incidental, and distingished 'Wiley v. Aberdeen, supra, on that ground. While we also stated that in the Wiley case, the city had never maintained the culvert in question, it was not on this distinction that the case was decided. We assumed that the city was authorized to maintain the drain on county property. Sigurdson v. Seattle is not authority for the proposition that a city, by maintaining a drain on private property for a private benefit, may become liable to the property owner for damage resulting from defects in, or the failure to maintain, the drain.\nSo far as the record reveals, the improvements which the city placed upon the Papac property in 1919 and those placed there in 1933 were undertaken gratuitously. In neither case could the act of installing them result in a liability to maintain them, when they were neither authorized by official action nor installed for a public purpose.\nThe judgment is reversed and the mandatory injunction dissolved.\nOtt, Mallery, Hill, and Weaver, JJ., concur.\nJanuary 17, 1957. Petition for rehearing denied."

    "Dolixver, J.\nRichard and Elizabeth Hedreen challenge the unpublished decision of the Court of Appeals, Division One, affirming the trial court\u2019s reformation of a lease, into which they entered with Hedreen Company, to accord with a loan commitment letter issued to them by Washington Mutual Savings Bank. See Washington Mut. Sav. Bank v. Hedreen, noted at 71 Wn. App. 1019 (1993). They also challenge the trial court\u2019s ruling, affirmed but not discussed by the Court of Appeals, holding them personally liable to the bank for unpaid loan payments.\nJefferson Square is a mixed-use development in West Seattle, completed in 1987, which includes office, retail, and residential space. Defendants Richard and Elizabeth He-dreen (hereinafter Hedreen) are the developers. Upon completion of the development, Hedreen applied for a $13 million loan from Plaintiff Washington Mutual Savings Bank (hereinafter Washington Mutual) to permanently finance the retail and office portions of the project. The bank approved Hedreen\u2019s application and on September 24, 1987, it issued a commitment letter detailing the terms of the loan. Hedreen signed the commitment letter on October 4, 1987. The letter provided, inter alia, that (1) the loan was to be evidenced by a promissory note, and (2) Hedreen was to execute a \"Master Lease\u201d with R.C. Hedreen Company for all the office space unleased on the date of closing. R.C. Hedreen Company is a corporation, wholly owned by Hedreen.\nHedreen\u2019s chief financial officer prepared the Master Lease. It covered 24,525 square feet of office and retail space. The total amount of such space in the project equals 56,766 square feet. The difference represented space on which leases either shortly were to be finalized or were being negotiated. The Master Lease was forwarded to Washington Mutual on November 6, 1987, for review. A bank employee reviewed the Master Lease, but did not compare it to the leases that Hedreen had executed with tenants other than R.C. Hedreen Company, to determine if it actually covered all of the space not covered by those leases. Moreover, a bank attorney who reviewed the Master Lease failed to notice that the amount of space leased fell short of that required by the commitment letter.\nClosing occurred on December 21,1987, at which time He-dreen executed and delivered to Washington Mutual a promissory note. Hedreen did not bring the discrepancy between the Master Lease and the commitment letter to the attention of the bank at the time of the closing. Due to financial difficulties that resulted from his inability to secure tenants for the unleased space, Hedreen defaulted on the loan and ceased making payments on it in October 1989. At that time, Washington Mutual discovered the discrepancy between the Master Lease and the commitment letter. Accordingly, the bank filed an action against Hedreen for reformation of the Master Lease or, in the alternative, for breach of the commitment letter. Washington Mutual contended that if successful on either of these theories, it would be entitled to recover from Hedreen approximately $857,000, which equals the additional amount Hedreen would have collected in rent had the Master Lease been written to cover all 56,766 square feet of office and retail space. The bank based this contention on the premise that it would have received those rental payments from Hedreen as loan payments if the Master Lease had initially been written in accordance with the commitment letter.\nAfter reviewing the evidence, the trial court was convinced that Washington Mutual intended the Master Lease to cover all office space unleased at the time of the closing, and that Hedreen was aware of this intention. That court also found that Hedreen had represented to the bank that the Master Lease would cover all of the unleased space. The court therefore concluded both that Hedreen had a duty to inform the bank of the discrepancy between the Master Lease and the commitment letter, and that He-dreen breached this duty. Accordingly, the trial court found Hedreen culpable of inequitable conduct, and granted Washington Mutual\u2019s request to reform the Master Lease to cover all 56,766 square feet of unleased office and retail space as specified in the commitment letter. Additionally, the court subscribed to Washington Mutual\u2019s point of view that it was entitled to recover from Hedreen the $857,000 that Hedreen would have received had the Master Lease been drafted in accordance with the letter. Therefore, it held Hedreen personally liable for this amount. The Court of Appeals, Division One, affirmed the trial court rulings. Subsequently, Hedreen petitioned this court for review.\nIn pursuing its claim against Hedreen, the trial court also found that Washington Mutual incurred reasonable attorney fees in the amount of $258,450. The trial court therefore concluded that Washington Mutual is entitled to recover those fees as the prevailing party. Accordingly, that court entered a personal judgment against Hedreen for the aforementioned amount. The Court of Appeals, Division One, affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment without elaborating upon it. Hedreen requested this court to review this ruling.\nHedreen submits that the trial court erred in reforming the Master Lease. A party to a contract is entitled to reformation of the contract if either there has been a mutual mistake or one party is mistaken and the other party engaged in fraud or inequitable conduct. Gammel v. Diethelm, 59 Wn.2d 504, 507, 368 P.2d 718 (1962); Kelley v. Von Herberg, 184 Wash. 165, 174, 50 P.2d 23 (1935). Washington Mutual argues that the trial court correctly reformed the Master Lease because the bank was mistaken as to the coverage of the Master Lease and Hedreen engaged in inequitable conduct.\nA party has engaged in fraud or inequitable conduct if it conceals a material fact from the other party. Kelley, at 174. However, concealment only constitutes fraud or inequitable conduct when the party possessing the knowledge has a duty to disclose that knowledge to the other party. Oates v. Taylor, 31 Wn.2d 898, 904, 199 P.2d 924 (1948); Kelley, at 174-75.\nWashington Mutual contends that Hedreen had a duty to inform Washington Mutual at closing that the Master Lease did not cover all unleased office space. We agree. In general, \"[s]ome type of special relationship must exist before the duty [to inform] will arise.\u201d Colonial Imports, Inc. v. Carlton Northwest, Inc., 121 Wn.2d 726, 732, 853 P.2d 913 (1993). In those cases where a court has found a duty to disclose, the circumstances surrounding the transaction have created a relationship of trust and confidence upon which the injured party was entitled to rely. Kelley, at 175. New Washington cases addressing reformation of a contract have foc\u00fcsed on the duty to disclose issue. The following cases provide some guidance as to whether a duty to disclose has arisen in the instant case: Kaufmann v. Woodard, 24 Wn.2d 264, 163 P.2d 606 (1945); Kelley v. Von Herberg, supra; Waite v. Salestrom, 201 Neb. 224, 266 N.W.2d 908 (1978).\nHedreen relies primarily upon Kelley to support his position that he did hot have an affirmative duty to disclose. In Kelley, a lessee leased a plot of land from a lessor with the intention of constructing a building on it. The lease contained a provision allowing the lessee to assign the lease after completion if he was not in default, but did not contain any provision regarding his liability upon assignment.\nPrior to signing the lease, the parties had engaged in extensive negotiations regarding its terms. Throughout the negotiations the lessor assured the lessee that he would not be held liable on the lease upon assignment. The lessor prepared the lease. However, he did not include a provision that reflected his assurances. After construction was complete the lessee assigned the lease. He subsequently defaulted on the lease payments.\nThe lessor brought an action to recover past due rent. In response, the lessee requested that the court reform the lease to conform with the lessor\u2019s initial oral assurances. The lessee argued that the lessor was obligated to inform the lessee before execution that the lease did not contain a provision releasing the lessee from liability upon assignment. The court concluded that the lessor did not have such an affirmative duty because the parties dealt at arm\u2019s length and had access to the same means of acquiring information. Specifically, both parties had the opportunity to read the lease before signing it.\nIt is not clear whether the parties in Kelley reached an agreement regarding the lessee\u2019s postassignment liability prior to the execution of the lease. If the parties did not enter such an agreement with respect to this issue, Kelley would be inapplicable to the present case, in which the parties did indeed reach a preliminary agreement regarding the coverage of the Master Lease. However, even if the parties in Kelley are viewed to have entered a preliminary agreement, we decline to follow Kelley in the instant case for two reasons. First, Kelley is a plurality opinion in which only three justices voiced their belief that the lessor did not have a duty to inform the lessee that he would remain liable upon assignment. Second, and more importantly, Kelley directly conflicts with the decision of this court in Kaufmann v. Woodard, supra. Kaufmann, a case not cited by either of the parties in this action, was decided by this court 10 years after Kelley.\nIn Kaufmann, a seller contracted to sell two plots of land to a buyer. One of the plots was encumbered by a mortgage. Subsequently, the mortgagee of that plot and the seller negotiated an agreement which indicated that the mortgagee would release the seller from his obligations on the mortgage in exchange for assignment of the contract of sale into which the seller had entered with the buyer. Both parties understood that the assignment was to include the entire contract of sale, which encompassed both of the plots. The seller prepared the documents effecting the assignment. In doing so, he only included one of the two plots that were the subject of the sale contract. Because the mortgagee and the seller had previously transacted business, the mortgagee did not review the assignment documents before he signed them. The mortgagee subsequently sued to have those documents reformed to include both plots. This court affirmed the trial court\u2019s reformation of the documents, concluding that the seller had a duty to inform the mortgagee that the documents he had prepared covered only one plot.\nOne decision from outside Washington, Waite v. Salestrom, supra, is directly on point. In Waite, a seller and a buyer entered a written option agreement which gave the buyer the right to purchase the seller\u2019s land for a specified sum. A provision of the agreement stated that the seller agreed to subordinate his lien on the land to that of any party lending funds to the buyer to purchase the property. The buyer exercised the option.\nThe final documents were prepared by attorneys representing all parties. The terms of those documents did not conform to the subordination provision of the option. Instead, the documents provided for a series of deeds of trust and notes to be executed. However, all parties apparently agreed to this alternative structure of the transaction. After being drafted, the deeds of trust and notes were presented to the buyer for signature. Prior to signing them, the buyer added the phrase \"without recourse\u201d to the note in order to relieve him of any personal liability. He did not inform the seller of the change, but expected him to object if it was not satisfactory. The seller executed the documents without noticing the change.\nSubsequently, the seller sued to reform the note to exclude the phrase \"without recourse\u201d. The trial court granted the reformation and the Nebraska Supreme Court concluded that the buyer had a duty to inform the seller that he had altered the note. The court based its conclusion on the existence of a prior agreement between the parties, as evidenced by the option contract, which held the buyer personally liable. The court noted that the substance of that contract was not altered by the subsequent modification of the structure of the transaction.\nThe decisions of the Waite and Kaufmann courts are controlling in the present case. Like in Kaufmann and Waite, the parties in the instant case entered into a preliminary agreement, had equal access to information, and negotiated at arm\u2019s length. Washington Mutual and Hedreen executed a commitment letter which both parties understood to require Hedreen to enter a master lease with Hedreen Company covering all of the unleased office space in Jefferson Square. The commitment letter was negotiated by Washington Mutual and Hedreen, both of whom are sophisticated parties. Hedreen is a real estate developer, and Washington Mutual is a bank in the business of making loans. Moreover, both parties had an opportunity to review the final loan documents before they signed them.\nTherefore, Hedreen had a duty to inform Washington Mutual about the discrepancy between the Master Lease and the commitment letter. He failed to do so. Thus, he has engaged in inequitable conduct. Accordingly, Washington Mutual is entitled to have the Master Lease reformed to accord with the commitment letter.\nHedreen contends that even if he breached his obligation to inform Washington Mutual about the discrepancy between the commitment letter and the Master Lease, he cannot be held liable for the resulting damages because the bank was negligent in not carefully reading the lease to discover the discrepancy before signing it. The courts of Washington, as well as those of other jurisdictions, are in agreement that negligence is not a bar to reformation of a contract when the reformation claim is based upon mutual or unilateral mistake. See, e.g., Meyer v. Young, 23 Wn.2d 109, 113, 159 P.2d 908 (1945); Carlson v. Druse, 79 Wash. 542, 548-49, 140 P. 570 (1914); Home Stake Prod. Co. v. Trustees of Iowa College, 331 F.2d 919, 921 (10th Cir. 1964). In discussing the availability of reformation as a remedy when there has been a unilateral mistake, the Gammel court stated the \"[f]act that the first party was negligent in failing to observe that the writing does not express what he has assented to does not deprive him of this remedy\u201d. Gammel v. Diethelm, 59 Wn.2d 504, 508, 368 P.2d 718 (1962) (quoting 3 Arthur L. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 614, at 730 (I960)). Similarly, the Daly court has stated:\nReformation will be granted when there is a mistake on the part of one of the parties as to the content of a document and there is fraud or inequitable conduct on the part of the other party. It is not determinative that the mistaken party could have noticed the discrepancy between his understanding and the written agreement by reading the documents. . . .\n(Citations omitted.) Mitchell Int\u2019l Enters., Inc. v. Daly, 33 Wn. App. 562, 565, 656 P.2d 1113, review denied, 99 Wn.2d 1021 (1983).\n\"It is not essential, therefore, that one seeking the aid of a court of equity to reform a contract show that he is wholly free from fault. Mere negligence not rising to the dignity of a violation of a positive legal duty, as negligence that is a mere inadvertence, does not preclude relief. Nor will relief be denied where, in the circumstances, the negligence of the party seeking relief is excusable.\u201d\nMeyer, at 113 (quoting 45 Am. Jur. Reformation of Instruments \u00a7 78, at 632 (1943)).\nAdditionally, in Waite v. Salestrom, 201 Neb. 224, 231, 266 N.W.2d 908 (1978), the court noted that \"[m]ere carelessness, however, is not necessarily a defense to an action for reformation.\u201d The case law is in accord with the Restatement of Contracts, which states:\nA mistaken party\u2019s fault in failing to know or discover the facts before making the contract does not bar him from avoidance of reformation under the rules stated in this Chapter, unless his fault amounts to a failure to act in good faith and in accordance with reasonable standards of fair dealing.\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 157 (1979). Comment b to this section of the Restatement explains the circumstances under which it is applicable.\nThe exceptional rule stated in the present Section with regard to reformation has no application to the common case in which the term in question was not the subject of prior negotiations. It only affects cases that come within the scope of \u00a7 155, under which there must have been an agreement that preceded the writing. In such a case, a party\u2019s negligence in failing to read the writing does not preclude reformation if the writing does not correctly express the prior agreement. . . .\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 157 cmt. b.\nIf negligence were a defense to a reformation claim, then reformation would almost never be available as a remedy because mistake is most frequently a basis for reformation, and negligence generally results from mistake. Carlson v. Druse, 79 Wash. 542, 548, 140 P. 570 (1914); Home Stake, at 921. This rationale for allowing reformation when negligence has occurred is also espoused by the authors of the Restatement.\nThe mere fact that a mistaken party could have avoided the mistake by the exercise of reasonable care does not preclude either avoidance or reformation. Indeed, since a party can often avoid a mistake by the exercise of such care, the availability of relief would be severely circumscribed if he were to be barred by his negligence. . . .\n(Citations omitted.) Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 157 cmt. a.\nHedreen cites a number of cases, including Yakima Cy. (W. Vly.) Fire Protec. Dist. 12 v. Yakima, 122 Wn.2d 371, 858 P.2d 245 (1993); Skagit State Bank v. Rasmussen, 109 Wn.2d 377, 745 P.2d 37 (1987); and National Bank v. Equity Investors, 81 Wn.2d 886, 506 P.2d 20 (1973), for the proposition that \"a party to a contract which he has voluntarily signed will not be heard to declare that he did not read it, or was ignorant of its contents.\u201d Skagit State Bank, at 381 (quoting Equity Investors, at 912). None of these cases deal with the issue of reformation. As previously discussed, reformation is a unique remedy available under limited circumstances. Although negligence may bar other remedies, it is clear that it does not bar reformation except under extreme circumstances, which include a failure to act in good faith or to abide by reasonable standards of fair dealing. Hedreen does not contend that either of these extreme circumstances exists. Therefore, the aforementioned cases and the rule for which they are cited are inapplicable to the present case.\nHedreen further asserts that even if this court upholds the trial court\u2019s reformation of the Master Lease, he cannot be held personally liable on it. This argument is without merit. Section 10 of the promissory note signed by both Richard and Elizabeth Hedreen states:\nIf default is made in the payment of any amount payable hereunder when due . . ., then, at the option of holder, the entire indebtedness evidenced hereby shall become immediately due and payable . . ..\nFurthermore, based on this note the trial court found:\nRCH is liable to Hedreen for additional rental amounts owed under the Master Lease as reformed commencing as of December 21, 1987. Hedreen, in turn, is personally liable to Washington Mutual for the same additional amounts owed after He-dreen\u2019s default on October 1, 1989, pursuant to the Promissory Note and the Deed of Trust.\nFinding of fact 32.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Master Lease as reformed and the Deed of Trust and the Promissory Note, Washington Mutual is entitled to recover from Hedreen personally ... in the total amount of $857,025.\nFinding of fact 35.\nHedreen also contends that he is not personally liable to Washington Mutual for the $258,450 in attorney fees that Washington Mutual expended in litigating its"

    "Finley, C. J.\nThis is an action for damages for trespass by water or taking land without just compensation. The trial court granted judgment for the plaintiff, and the defendant, King County, has appealed.\nThe respondent\u2019s land, on which is situated her residence, is located near Des Moines Way and South 107th Street in King County. Respondent alleged that the county collected surface waters in drains or artificial channels along the west side of Des Moines Way and caused them to be diverted beneath Des Moines Way at South 207th Street, thence along the north side and under South 207th Street, and onto her property. At the trial respondent contended that the surface waters thus spewed onto her land made ingress and egress difficult, and caused the value of her property to be depreciated.\nThe county did not deny respondent\u2019s allegations and contentions. Its defense was essentially a disclaimer of liability for respondent\u2019s drainage problems.\nRespondent and her now deceased husband acquired the property concerned in 1921. From the time of acquisition until 1958, a drainage problem existed on the land caused by waters draining from surrounding areas of higher elevation through the system of culverts and ditches described above. The drainage was described at the trial as \u201cseepage.\u201d Although it caused inconvenience, from what we can discern from the record no appreciable damage resulted. During 1958 and 1959 (the exact dates are nowhere supplied in the record), the county improved the roadways in the vicinity of Des Moines Way and South 200th. It appears that property owners on the east side of Des Moines Way near that area were bothered by drainage waters. To alleviate the drainage problem of those property owners, the county, in connection with road improvement work, placed a culvert beneath Des Moines Way at South 200th. Since installation of the culvert, waters from the east side of Des Moines Way have drained to the west side, where they combine with waters draining down the west side, and follow a channeled course to respondent\u2019s property. The additional waters have changed respondent\u2019s relatively minor seepage problem to an inundation problem.\nThe trial court found, in effect, that the flow of water across respondent\u2019s land was increased by the acts of the county, and that the county must bear the responsibility for solving the problem. The difference between the value of respondent\u2019s property after the increased flow as compared with its value prior thereto was found to be $2,350.66. That figure was derived from testimony as to the estimated costs of underlaying respondent\u2019s property with drain pipe to handle the flow. Judgment was entered for the respondent, requiring the county to underlay respondent\u2019s land with drain pipes and pay the sum of $300 attorney\u2019s fees; or, in the alternative, to pay to respondent $2,650.66 ($2,350.66 for the cost of laying the drain pipe and $300.00 attorney\u2019s fees) plus costs and disbursements.\nThe respondent contends that the county\u2019s assignments of error are improper and fail to raise any question before this court. While the manner in which error is assigned is not commendable, we find that for the purposes of this case justiciable issues are presented to the court, and we will consider the arguments on their merits.\nKing County argues that the judgment of the trial court should be reversed, because (1) respondent\u2019s claim is barred by the statute of limitations; (2) the flow across respondent\u2019s land is of surface waters in a natural drainage course and no responsibility can attach for increasing or hastening the flow; and (3) the county has no drainage district powers and is without jurisdiction to order drainage work or to pay general tax money for the drainage work. A fourth contention need not be considered, because no argument was directed in support thereof in appellant\u2019s brief. Obde v. Schlemeyer (1960), 56 Wn. (2d) 449, 353 P. (2d) 672.\nIn support of its first contention the county argues that the system of culverts and ditches located in the drainage area herein concerned was first established around 1920 and, therefore, if there has been any taking of respondent\u2019s land by virtue of trespass by water, as a result of the drainage system, it occurred when the system was first constructed. Thus, the county concludes, it is much too late in the game for respondent to complain.\nThe county\u2019s contention is unavailing. Respondent does not base her action on the inconsequential invasions of her property, caused by the county\u2019s maintenance of the primary system of ditches and culverts occurring prior to the diversion of waters accomplished by the 1958-59 project. Indeed, these invasions probably did not provide a basis for relief. Wood v. Tacoma (1911), 66 Wash. 266, 119 Pac. 859. See, generally, 18 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \u00a7\u00a7 53.132-53.144, pp. 515 - 563 (3rd ed. 1950). The injury about which respondent complains occurred when the acts of the county caused the flow of waters across her property to increase to the extent that substantial damage resulted. Assuming that the three-year limitation period of RCW 4.16.080 is controlling (see Ackerman v. Port of Seattle (1960), 55 Wn. (2d) 400, 348 P. (2d) 664, 77 A. L. R. (2d) 1344; and Cheskov v. Port of Seattle (1960), 55 Wn. (2d) 416, 348 P. (2d) 673), the respondent, by commencing her action on December 22, 1959, has easily satisfied the most stringent limitation period arguably applicable. The trial court correctly determined that respondent\u2019s claim was not barred by the statute of limitations.\nThe county\u2019s second contention is based primarily on passages in Laurelon Terrace v. Seattle (1952), 40 Wn. (2d) 883, 246 P. (2d) 1113, which state that \u201cthe flow of surface water along natural drains may be hastened or incidentally increased by artificial means, so long as the water is not ultimately diverted from its natural flow onto the property of another . . . \u201d and \u201cA city is not negligent if it increases the flow of water through a natural drainway, due to streets and catchbasins, unless the drainage is increased beyond the capacity of the watercourse in its natural condition.\u201d According to the county\u2019s theory, surface waters can be discharged upon respondent\u2019s land with impunity because the \u201cseepage\u201d flowing across the land prior to 1958 established a natural drainway, and, as long as the additional rate or flow does not breach natural barriers of the drainage course, liability cannot attach to the county.\nThe Laurelon case does not control the disposition of this case because of factual differences. When a question is raised as to the existence of a natural watercourse, that question must be determined by the trier of fact. Tierney v. Yakima Cy. (1925), 136 Wash. 481, 239 Pac. 248. In the instant case the trial court, sitting as the trier of fact, refused to find that the drainage waters flowing through a system of ditches and culverts onto respondent\u2019s property established a natural drainage course. The trial court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial credible evidence, and this court, of course, cannot substitute its judgment for that of the trial court as to findings of fact adequately supported by the record. Tenco, Inc. v. Manning (1962), 59 Wn. (2d) 479, 368 P. (2d) 372; Thorndike v. Hesperian Orchards, Inc. (1959), 54 Wn. (2d) 570, 343 P. (2d) 183. The Laurelon case deals with the question of a municipality\u2019s liability for increased drainage (caused by paving and surfacing streets) into an unquestioned natural stream. The case accurately states the general rule of nonliability on the part of a municipality for additional drainage into a natural stream as long as the stream is not diverted or filled beyond its natural flow. In the instant case the factual question as to the character of the drainage flow having been resolved by the trial court, the legal question as to the liability of a municipality for collecting and diverting waters through a system of artificial channels and discharging them onto the property of a private landowner is presented.\nThe answer to the question thus presented is, we think, aptly stated in 18 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \u00a7 53.144 at pp. 556-558 (3rd ed. 1950). The following quotation from that work indicates both the applicable rule and the relationship of the rule announced in the Laurelon case..\n\u201c . . . It is an exception to the general rule of non-liability, in that a municipality is liable if, in the course of an authorized construction, it collects surface water by an artificial channel, or in large quantities, and pours it, in a body, upon the land of a private person, to his injury. Under this rule, while municipal authorities may pave and grade streets and are not ordinarily liable for an increase in surface water naturally falling on the land of a private owner where the work is properly done, they are not permitted to concentrate and gather such water into artificial drains or channels and throw it on the land of an individual owner in such manner and volume as to cause substantial injury to such land and without making adequate provision for its proper outflow, unless compensation is made, and for breach of duty in this respect an action will lie.\u201d\nWe hold that the trial court was correct in holding that the county is responsible for the trespass by water across respondent\u2019s land, accomplishing thereby a taking of respondent\u2019s property without compensation.\nAppellant\u2019s third contention may pose some interesting problems, but they are outside the scope of this case. Complications in connection with satisfaction of an alleged liability are not a defense to the action alleging liability. The basic question before this court is whether the trial court erred in holding the county responsible for the damage done to respondent\u2019s property. Having adjudicated liability, our task is completed and dissertations in relation to the scope of the powers of the county or its jurisdiction would be inappropriate.\nThe decision of the trial court should be and it is hereby affirmed.\nDonworth, Ott, Hunter, and Hamilton, JJ., concur."

    "Durham, J.\n\u2014 Petitioners Cal and Elsa Currens (the Currenses) seek review of an unpublished Court of Appeals decision affirming the summary judgment dismissal of their complaint against Respondents Irene Sleek and Dennis Stephenson Logging (together, Respondents). At issue is whether liability may arise for property damage caused by an increased flow of surface water onto the Currenses\u2019 property after Sleek clear-cut and graded her land. We hold that the common enemy doctrine shields a landowner from liability for surface water flooding only if the landowner exercises due care in preventing unnecessary injury to neighboring properties. Because there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the Respondents exercised due care, we reverse summary judgment and reinstate the Currenses\u2019 claim.\nI\nThe Currenses and Irene Sleek own neighboring property in Clark County. Water from a portion of the Sleek property naturally seeps into a forested, low-lying sink area on the Currenses\u2019 property. In 1993, Sleek decided to clear-cut her property in order to develop four home sites. As required by the State Environmental Policy Act of 1971 (SEPA), chapter 43.21C RCW Sleek submitted an Environmental Checklist to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The checklist indicated that Sleek would plant trees to enhance vegetation on the property and would install dry wells to mitigate storm water impacts.\nDennis Stephenson Logging clear-cut and graded Sleek\u2019s property in 1994. However, no action was taken to revegetate the land or to reduce the flow of surface water over the sites. No drywells were ever installed.\nThe following year, the natural sink area in the Currenses\u2019 property flooded, causing 11 trees to fall. The Currenses removed an additional 20 trees in order to ensure the safety of their home. A drainage engineer reported that \u201cthe logging on the Sleek property substantially increased the volume and peak flow rates of stormwater onto the Currenses\u2019 property, at the bottom of the natural drainage way and in the natural sink.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 92. He estimated this increase to be 3 times the natural volume that would accumulate during a large storm and 12 times the normal volume caused by a standard rainstorm. The engineer then concluded that the trees fell due to this increased runoff. The Currenses\u2019 tree expert and contractor supported this conclusion.\nThe Currenses filed suit against Respondents in April 1995. The trial court granted summary judgment dismissal on the grounds that Sleek was shielded from liability under the common enemy doctrine. The Court of Appeals affirmed. The Currenses petitioned this court for review, arguing that Sleek was liable because her actions were unreasonable and urging the court to reject the common enemy doctrine. The Washington Environmental Council has submitted an amicus brief.\nII\nThe issues in this appeal are governed by the common enemy doctrine, which has directed the law of surface water in Washington since 1896. Cass v. Dicks, 14 Wash. 75, 44 P. 113 (1896). Surface water is \u201cvagrant or diffused [water] produced by rain, melting snow, or springs.\u201d King County v. Boeing Co., 62 Wn.2d 545, 550, 384 P.2d 122 (1963). The Currenses contend that Sleek is liable for the damage brought about when the grading and construction on Sleek\u2019s property caused surface water to flow off of the property and to collect in a low point on the Currenses\u2019 land.\nIn its strictest form, the common enemy doctrine allows landowners to dispose of unwanted surface water in any way they see fit, without liability for resulting damage to one\u2019s neighbor. The idea is that \u201csurface water ... is regarded as an outlaw and a common enemy against which anyone may defend himself, even though by so doing injury may result to others.\u201d Cass, 14 Wash, at 78. Washington still adheres to the general common enemy rule that a landowner may develop his or her land without regard for the drainage consequences to other landowners. However, because a strict application of this rule is widely regarded as inequitable, this court has adopted several exceptions to the common enemy doctrine over the years.\nThe first exception provides that, although landowners may block the flow of diffuse surface water onto their land, they may not inhibit the flow of a watercourse or natural drainway. Island County v. Mackie, 36 Wn. App. 385, 388, 675 P.2d 607 (1984). Under this exception, a landowner who dams up a stream, gully, or drainway will not be shielded from liability under the common enemy doctrine. A natural drainway must be kept open to carry water into streams and lakes, and a lower proprietor cannot obstruct surface water when it is running in a natural drainage channel or depression. 78 Am. Jur. 2d Waters \u00a7 134 (1975).\nAn additional exception prevents landowners from collecting water and channeling it onto their neighbors\u2019 land. Wilber Dev. Corp. v. Les Rowland Constr., Inc., 83 Wn.2d 871, 875, 523 P.2d 186 (1974) (\u201cSurface waters may not be artificially collected and discharged upon adjoining lands in quantities greater than or in a manner different from the natural flow thereof.\u201d), overruled on other grounds by Phillips v. King County, 136 Wn.2d 946, 968 P.2d 871 (1998). This rule prohibits a landowner from creating an unnatural conduit, but allows him or her to direct diffuse surface waters into preexisting natural waterways and drainways. Laurelon Terrace v. City of Seattle, 40 Wn.2d 883, 892, 246 P.2d 1113 (1952) (\u201c[T]he flow of surface water along natural drains may be hastened or incidentally increased by artificial means, so long as the water is not ultimately diverted from its natural flow onto the property of another.\u201d); Trigg v. Timmerman, 90 Wash. 678, 681-82, 156 P. 846 (1916) (\u201c[T]he flow of surface water along such depressions or drain ways may be hastened and incidentally increased by artificial means so long as the water is not diverted from its natural flow.\u201d).\nRead in conjunction with the above exceptions, the common enemy doctrine in Washington allows landowners to alter the flow of surface water to the detriment of their neighbors, so long as they do not block a watercourse or natural drainway, nor collect and discharge water onto their neighbors\u2019 land in quantities greater than, or in a manner different from, its natural flow. These exceptions to the common enemy doctrine are not unique to Washington, but have been embraced by nearly every jurisdiction where the common enemy doctrine governs drainage liability. See Stanley V. Kinyon & Robert C. McClure, Interferences With Surface Waters, 24 Minn. L. Rev. 891, 916-17 (1940); Frank E. Maloney & Sheldon J. Plager, Diffused Surface Water: Scourge or Bounty ?, 8 Nat. Resources J. 72 (1968); Robert E. Beck, The Law of Drainage, in 5 Waters and Water Rights \u00a7 450.2 (Robert Emmet Clark ed., 1972).\nAt the heart of this appeal lies the parties\u2019 dispute over whether, and to what extent, Washington courts should also consider the reasonableness of a landowner\u2019s actions in determining liability for damage caused by excess surface water. Respondents argue that the common enemy doctrine in Washington does not allow a court to consider the reasonableness of a landowner\u2019s actions in determining liability. The Currenses assert that Washington has already recognized that the common enemy doctrine shields only reasonable conduct; a landowner who acts unreasonably may be liable for damages caused by surface water flooding.\nMost jurisdictions where the common enemy doctrine has been adopted as the basic rule have modified the doctrine by importing into it qualifications based upon concepts of reasonable use or negligence. 5 Beck, supra, \u00a7 451.2(C) (1972) (\u201cIn at least fifteen jurisdictions there is language in the opinions suggesting that a landowner must exercise \u2018due care\u2019 . . . .\u201d). Under this approach, landowners are free to alter the flow of surface water, subject to the exception that they must exercise their rights in good faith and with such care as to avoid unnecessary damage to the property of adjacent owners. See, e.g., Young v. Moore, 241 Mo. App. 436, 236 S.W.2d 740, 744 (1951); Nichol v. Yocum, 173 Neb. 298, 113 N.W.2d 195, 199 (1962); Ballard v. Ace Wrecking Co., 289 A.2d 888, 889-90 (D.C. 1972). This due care exception thus serves to cushion the otherwise harsh allocation of rights under the common enemy doctrine. Although it does not affect a landowner\u2019s ability to alter the flow of surface water, it does require avoidance of unnecessary infringement upon a neighbor\u2019s free enjoyment of his or her property. Reutner v. Vouga, 367 S.W.2d 34, 41 (Mo. Ct. App. 1963). What this means in practical terms is that landowners may improve their land with impunity (subject to local land use and permitting requirements) and are not liable for damage caused by the change in the flow of surface water onto their neighbors\u2019 land, so long as the landowners act in good faith and do not damage adjacent property in excess of that called for by the particular project.\nWashington has never explicitly adopted a due care exception to its common enemy doctrine, but language in past cases indicates that landowner negligence has been a relevant factor in our decisions. In Wood v. City of Tacoma, 66 Wash. 266, 273-74, 119 P. 859 (1911), we stated that a landowner in developing land or fending off diffuse waters may be held liable for doing so negligently. We have also held that a landowner may not increase drainage of surface water into a drainway to such an extent that the capacity of the drain is overtaxed. Strickland v. City of Seattle, 62 Wn.2d 912, 916-17, 385 P.2d 33 (1963). Furthermore, in both Laurelon, 40 Wn.2d 883 and Trigg, 90 Wash. 678, the court absolved the landowner who caused the flooding from liability, noting that there was no negligence. Finally, in Morris v. McNicol, 83 Wn.2d 491, 495, 519 P.2d 7 (1974), we stated that the common enemy doctrine would prevent liability only \u201cif the upland landowner\u2019s use is reasonable.\u201d We repeated this language with approval recently in DiBlasi v. City of Seattle, 136 Wn.2d 865, 969 P.2d 10 (1998). Because of these references, other jurisdictions have listed Washington as a jurisdiction that has incorporated a due care exception into its common enemy jurisprudence. Gregory C. Sisk, Toward a Unified Reasonable Use Approach to Water Drainage in Washington, 59 Wash. L. Rev. 61, 73 (1983) (citing Argyelan v. Haviland, 435 N.E.2d 973, 986 (Ind. 1982) (Hunter, J., dissenting); Pendergrast v. Aiken, 293 N.C. 201, 236 S.E.2d 787, 793 (1977); Chudzinski v. City of Sylvania, 53 Ohio App. 2d 151, 372 N.E.2d 611, 615 n.3 (1976); State v. Deetz, 66 Wis. 2d 1, 224 N.W.2d 407, 414 n.3 (1974)). See also Janet Fairchild, Annotation, Modern Status of Rules Governing Interference With Drainage Surface Waters, 93 A.L.R.3d, 1193, 1205-06 (1979).\nAlthough this court\u2019s references to a reasonableness requirement have been vague, the language in Wood, Morris, and DiBlasi indicates that Washington requires that a landowner exercise due care when engaging in activities that affect the flow of surface water. Furthermore, such an exception to the common enemy doctrine is mandated by the realities of increased development density in the state. Indeed, we know of no other jurisdiction in the country that still adheres to the traditional common enemy doctrine without some sort of requirement that landowners not unreasonably interfere with their neighbor\u2019s enjoyment of their property. We therefore unambiguously hold that under our common enemy jurisprudence, landowners who alter the flow of surface water on their property must exercise their rights with due care by acting in good faith and by avoiding unnecessary damage to the property of others.\nIll\nAmicus curiae Washington Environmental Council asks the court to reject our common enemy jurisprudence entirely and to adopt in its place the reasonable use rule. Under the reasonable use rule, a landowner is entitled to make reasonable use of his or her land, even if the use alters the flow of surface water, but the landowner may incur liability if the interference is unreasonable in light of the relative advantage to the actor and disadvantage to the neighbor. 78 Am. Jur. 2d Waters \u00a7 122 (1975). The rule has been adopted from the Restatement of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 822-31, 833 (1939) and has been paraphrased by other courts as the right of landowners to deal with surface water as they wish so long as their act is reasonable under all the circumstances. Maloney & Plager, 8 Nat. Resources J. at 80. The doctrine rests on tort principles and thus involves a case-by-case analysis, including consideration of the nature and importance of the improvements, the foreseeability of the injury, the extent of the interference with the surface water, and the amount of injury. 78 Am. Jur. 2d Waters \u00a7 123 (1975). The reasonable use rule is akin to a nuisance cause of action and requires the court to weigh the utility of the improvements against the resulting damage to the adjacent property. Sisk, 59 Wash. L. Rev. at 77.\nAt least 20 jurisdictions now employ the reasonable use rule to decide drainage liability cases. See Heins Implement Co. v. Missouri Highway & Transp. Comm\u2019n, 859 S.W.2d 681, 690 (Mo. 1993). Several commentators have urged the repudiation of the common enemy doctrine in favor of the reasonable use rule. See Maloney & Plager, 8 Nat. Resources J. at 85-89; Sisk, 59 Wash. L. Rev. at 68 n.34. Advocates for the rule explain that it is less rigid and allows for increased flexibility in addressing surface water liability in a fact-specific manner. Id. In addition, the reasonable use rule is lauded because it shifts some of the costs inherent in increased urbanization back onto the developer. McGlashan v. Spade Rockledge Terrace Condo Dev. Corp., 62 Ohio St. 2d 55, 402 N.E.2d 1196, 1199 (1980).\nWe decline to abandon our common enemy jurisprudence in favor of the reasonable use rule. The critical difference between the two approaches is that the common enemy doctrine does not require any inquiry into the utility of the particular project. When determining liability under the common enemy doctrine, the due care exception requires the court to look only to whether the landowner has exercised due care in improving his or her land, i.e., whether the method employed by the landowner minimized any unnecessary impacts upon adjacent land. Unlike the reasonable use rule, a landowner\u2019s duty under the common enemy doctrine is not determined by weighing the nature and importance of the improvements against the damage caused to one\u2019s neighbor. Rather, a landowner has an unqualified right to embark on any improvements of his or her land allowed by law, but must limit the harm caused by changes in the flow of surface water to that which is reasonably necessary.\nA rule that requires parties to litigate the importance of a particular project in order to apportion liability is inconsistent with this state\u2019s historic deference to property rights. Furthermore, adopting the reasonable use rule would constitute an abrupt break with past precedent. In contrast, the common enemy doctrine, tempered by the due care exception, is consistent with the gradual evolution of our surface water drainage law. As Justice Hale said, \u201c[rjules of law, like governments, should not be changed for light or transient causes.\u201d State ex rel. Wash. State Finance Comm. v. Martin, 62 Wn.2d 645, 666, 384 P.2d 833 (1963). This court has applied the common enemy doctrine for over a century, and most recently in DiBlasi, 136 Wn.2d 865. We accordingly refuse the invitation to discard our common enemy jurisprudence in favor of the reasonable use rule.\nIV\nThe outcome of this appeal is thus determined by application of our common enemy doctrine. Respondents are not liable under the common enemy doctrine for flood damage caused by the improvements, unless, in the course of making those improvements, they blocked a.natural drain or waterway, collected and discharged water onto the neighbor\u2019s land, or failed to exercise due care in preventing unnecessary damage.\nUnder the facts of this case, it is clear that the first two exceptions to the common enemy doctrine do not apply. Respondents did not block the flow of a waterway or natural drain. Nor did they collect and discharge water onto the Currenses\u2019 property. In grading the land, the Respondents caused water that otherwise would have been absorbed into the ground to run off onto the Currenses\u2019 property. They did not construct culverts or ditches or artificially channel the water in any way. Rather, the water flowed in a diffuse fashion, by force of gravity, from a higher elevation to the sink hole on the Currenses\u2019 property.\nThe question here is whether the third exception applies to allow the Currenses to bring suit. The due care exception to the common enemy doctrine specifies that a landowner will be shielded from liability only where the changes in surface water flow are made both in good faith and in such a way as not to cause unnecessary damage. The Currenses have the burden of proof to show that the flooding damage of their property was a result of the Respondents\u2019 bad faith, or that it was in excess of that necessary for the completion of the project.\nThe Currenses assert that Sleek\u2019s failure to comply with the mitigation measures specified in the Environmental Checklist Sleek submitted to the DNR violates the due care exception. We do not now hold that the mere failure to comply with the Environmental Checklist in and of itself constitutes a lack of due care. However, such failure may be considered by the trier of fact in determining whether the Respondents acted in good faith and with such care as to avoid unnecessary damage to the Currenses\u2019 property. Given that genuine issues of material fact exist, summary judgment is inappropriate.\nCONCLUSION\nAlthough we decline to reject our common enemy jurisprudence in favor of the reasonable use rule, we take the opportunity to clarify that Washington\u2019s law of drainage allows for a due care exception to the general rule against liability. Because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Respondents exercised due care, summary judgment is reversed.\nSmith, Johnson, Alexander, Talmadge, and Ireland, JJ., concur.\nThere are three general schemes employed in the United States to apportion liability for damage caused by surface water flooding. These approaches are: (1) the common enemy doctrine, (2) the civil law rule, and (3) the reasonable use rule. Only a handful of states still follow the common enemy doctrine, many having abandoned it in favor of the rule of reasonable use. See Heins Implement Co. v. Missouri Highway & Transp.

The court implied that the common enemy doctrine applies only to situations where a landowner intentionally alters surface water flow, rather than inadvertently affecting the flow of surface water through development. There is no support in our case law for this distinction. The common enemy doctrine is a comprehensive scheme that governs the drainage of surface waters and it \u201capplies regardless of the purpose for which the drainage pattern of the land is altered, or whether the intent was actually to influence water flow.\u201d Gregory C.

    "Pearson, C.J. \u2014\nPlaintiffs brought this action to enforce conditions subsequent in a 1908 deed quitclaiming land to the City of Seattle (hereafter the City). The primary issue presented in this case is whether the acceptance by the City of a conditional transfer from the State constituted a breach of the condition found in the deed from the grantor to the City. The trial court and the Court of Appeals held that the City breached the condition subsequent and awarded damages to the plaintiffs. The City appeals contending the plaintiffs can no longer enforce the conditions, and that the City's use of the deed property does not constitute a taking. We reverse.\nIn 1883, the United States government issued a land patent to Charles Waters for property located in Seattle on the shores of Lake Washington. This property was subsequently purchased by C.B. Dodge Company (hereafter Dodge).\nIn 1908, Dodge quitclaimed a strip of the property to the City for the purpose of constructing Lake Washington Boulevard. Dodge also conveyed to the City \"any and all rights which the grantor may have to acquire or purchase the shorelands of Lake Washington in front of the described property\".\nThe deed included the following conditions:\n1. That the grantor reserves the right, for itself, its successors and assigns, upon theshores [sic] of Lake Washington in front of the above described property to construct and maintain a private boat-house . . . said boat-house to occupy not to exceed twenty-five (25) feet frontage along the shore of said Lake, and said boathouse to be for the personal use of C.B. Dodge and his family, or such other person or persons as shall hereafter own, or as a tenant or licensee occupy any part of block two (2) Maynard's Lake Washington Addition to the City of Seattle . . . and that the said grantee shall at all times permit the said construction, maintenance and use of the said boat-house and acquire and keep as its property such shore land as shall be necessary for said purpose.\nThe deed provided that the conditions could be enforced through a power of termination, as follows:\nAnd the party of the first part hereby reserves to itself and to its successors and assigns forever the right, in case of the breach of the foregoing conditions, or any of them, whether one or more, to re-enter the said premises and in case of said re-entry the said party of the first part, its successors or assigns, shall be revested with its former estate therein as though this conveyance had never been made, and no failure to enter for the breach of the said conditions, or any of them shall be held or construed to be a waiver of the right to so enter for such or any other or subsequent breach.\nIn 1913, the City acquired the shorelands in front of the Dodge property from the State pursuant to the Laws of 1913, ch. 183, which provided that the shorelands are\nhereby reserved for public uses and are hereby granted and donated to the city of Seattle for public park, parkway and boulevard purposes, and as a part of its public park, parkway and boulevard system and any diversion or attempted diversion of such lands so donated from such purposes shall cause the title to said lands to revert to the state.\nIn 1916, construction of the Hiram Chittenden Locks resulted in the lowering of Lake Washington by approximately 9 feet. Consequently, the shoreline of Lake Washington moved from 90 feet to 140 feet east of its former location. Title to the uncovered land remained in the City.\nBetween 1908 and 1983 neither Dodge nor its successors in interest made any demand upon the City for permission to build a boathouse. In July 1983, plaintiffs notified the City of their desire to build a boathouse pursuant to the conditions set forth in the 1908 deed. The City refused permission, and in September 1983, the plaintiffs informed the City of their election to reenter the premises and to declare that the property had been reverted in its entirety. In December 1983, the plaintiffs commenced this action for declaratory relief and damages.\nThe trial court interpreted the conditions in the 1908 deed to be valid conditions subsequent. The court held that the City had not breached the condition in 1913 when it acquired its title to the shoreland from the State; rather, the City had breached the conditions subsequent in 1983 when it refused to allow the plaintiffs to build a boathouse. The trial court awarded the plaintiffs $50,000 in damages. The Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court and also held that the City's refusal to grant the plaintiffs permission to build a boathouse constituted an unconstitutional taking.\nThe questions necessary for resolution are: (1) what were the conditions contained in the 1908 deed; (2) were such conditions valid; (3) were any breached; (4) when did such a breach occur; and (5) was the grantor's right of entry/power of termination (hereinafter power of termination) exercised within a reasonable time after a breach occurred?\nThe conditions in the deed were that the City would permit the construction of a boathouse on land in front of the deeded strip, and that the City would acquire and keep such land as necessary for that purpose. On their face such conditions appear valid. The deed purported to transfer to the City \"any and all rights which the grantor may have to acquire or purchase the shore lands of Lake Washington in front of said described property.\" (Italics ours.) It appears from such language that the parties to the deed may have been unclear as to what rights an upland owner would have to purchase newly uncovered shorelands. Although the trial court made no findings of fact and conclusions of law on this issue, the undisputed evidence at trial indicates there were statutory preference rights for upland property owners to acquire new shorelands, but those preference rights were only exercisable if the State platted and offered for sale the shorelands of navigable bodies of water. The unrefuted evidence indicates the State never offered the newly uncovered shorelands of Lake Washington for private sale, but instead the State donated them to the City in 1913. This would mean the shoreland upon which the contemplated boathouse was to be constructed never was owned by Dodge, nor would it have had rights to purchase such shorelands. The condition subsequent in the deed therefore required the City to acquire other land than was the subject of the deed and allow construction on that newly acquired property.\nAs a matter of public policy, a condition subsequent in a deed involving one parcel of land may not place restrictions on another parcel of land. We therefore hold that the parties to the deed had no right to encumber a piece of property which neither party owned at the time of the deed. However, even assuming the validity of the conditions subsequent in the deed which would require acquisition of shorelands by the City and permission to construct a boathouse on such land, the first of these conditions was breached in 1913, and the power of termination was not exercised within a reasonable time after that breach.\nA grantor of a power of termination has only a reasonable time after breach within which to declare a forfeiture or to elect not to declare a forfeiture. If a forfeiture is not declared within a reasonable time, the power of termination expires. Metropolitan Park Dist. v. Rigney, 65 Wn.2d 788, 399 P.2d 516 (1965). The most critical issue of this case is therefore whether the condition subsequent requiring the City to acquire and keep such property as was necessary to allow construction of a boathouse was breached in 1913 when the City accepted the new shoreland from the State, with the condition that it would revert to the State if used for other than park purposes.\nThe construction of deeds is a matter of law for the courts. Thompson v. Schlittenhart, 47 Wn. App. 209, 211, 734 P.2d 48, review denied, 108 Wn.2d 1019 (1987); Donald v. Vancouver, 43 Wn. App. 880, 883, 719 P.2d 966 (1986); Thomas v. Nelson, 35 Wn. App. 868, 871, 670 P.2d 682 (1983). A conclusion of law described as a finding of fact is reviewable as a conclusion of law. Willener v. Sweeting, 107 Wn.2d 388, 394, 730 P.2d 45 (1986); Woodruff v. McClellan, 95 Wn.2d 394, 395, 622 P.2d 1268 (1980); Barnett v. Buchan Baking Co., 45 Wn. App. 152, 156, 724 P.2d 1077 (1986), aff'd, 108 Wn.2d 405, 738 P.2d 1056 (1987). Whether the City's acquisition of the newly uncovered shorelands from the State (with the condition the lands only be used for park purposes) constitutes a breach of the condition subsequent in the deed from Dodge to the City is a question of law. The existence of and the language used in both transfers is undisputed and the issue then becomes whether the one transfer constitutes a breach to a condition subsequent in the prior transfer.\nThe challenge made to the trial court's finding concerns the legal effect of actions taken by the parties. Such a question is properly reviewable by this court. See Barnett v. Buchan Baking Co., supra at 156. The issue of whether the condition to acquire land for boathouse purposes was breached by the character of the City's acquisition in 1913 is not an issue of fact but an issue of the legal ramification of undisputed facts.\nThe 1908 deed provided that the \"grantee . . . permit the . . . construction ... of the said boat-house and acquire and keep as its property such shore land as shall be necessary for said purpose.\u201d (Italics ours.) In 1913 the State, by public statute, gave title to the bed of Lake Washington and shorelands (including the shorelands in front of the land conveyed from Dodge to the City) to the City of Seattle for use as a public park and provided that the land would revert to the State if used otherwise. Laws of 1913, ch. 183. The deed reserved the right to build \"in front of\" property conveyed. The trial court's finding of fact 10 found that both the City and Dodge intended the City to acquire land to accommodate construction of a boathouse. The City breached that condition in 1913 when it accepted the land from the State in such a manner that it was absolutely prohibited from granting permission to a private party to build for personal use. The Court of Appeals stated that the State (if asked) might have granted permission to build a boathouse on the lakeshore in spite of its right to retake the land, if used for other than park purposes. Martin v. Seattle, 46 Wn. App. 1, 5, 728 P.2d 1091 (1986). It is, however, not dispositive of the issue to recognize that the City might have sought permission from the State to violate the park-purpose condition. A grantor who is a holder of a power of termination can always ask the grantee after a breach of a condition to rectify such breach; however, such possibility does not mean no breach has occurred.\nGiven that the City's acceptance of the newly uncovered shorelands for park purposes breached its duty to acquire land to permit private construction of a boathouse, the issue arises whether the grantor (or his successors) was on notice of such a breach.\nPowers of termination are reversionary and therefore not subject to the rule against perpetuities, which means they can be \"extremely troublesome and clutter up titles with outmoded restraints, or with factors that have nothing to do with land use.\" Washington State Bar Ass'n, Real Property Deskbook \u00a7 6.3 (1979). In addition to clouding title for decades, if not indefinitely, powers of termination are disfavored because they involve a potential forfeiture of the transferred interest. Restatement of Property \u00a7 155, comment b (1936). In a different context the Washington Court of Appeals has recognized that \u201d[i]t is elementary law in this jurisdiction that forfeitures are not favored and never enforced in equity unless the right thereto is so clear as to permit no denial.\" Shoemaker v. Shaug, 5 Wn. App. 700, 704, 490 P.2d 439 (1971) (quoting John R. Hansen, Inc. v. Pacific Int'l Corp., 76 Wn.2d 220, 228, 455 P.2d 946 (1969)). Given that powers of termination can result in harsh forfeitures and can operate to cloud title indefinitely, some diligence on the part of holders of such future interests to determine if a grantee has breached a condition subsequent should be required. However, actual notice of breach should not be required; rather, we hold that if a holder of a power of termination knew or should with due diligence have known a breach had occurred, he has a reasonable time after a breach to reenter and declare a forfeiture of the estate granted. Here, the 1913 breach was or should have been apparent to the grantor because the newly uncovered shorelands were given by the State to the City by public law. See Laws of 1913, ch. 183.\nAll persons are charged with knowledge of the provisions of statutes and must take notice thereof. . . . All persons having property located within a state and subject to its dominion must take note of its statutes affecting the control or disposition of such property and of the procedure which they set up for those purposes.\n58 Am. Jur. 2d Notice \u00a7 21 (1971). In addition, the grantor and his successors were owners of adjacent waterview property and presumably were aware that the new shorelands were being utilized as a public park.\nTherefore, upon the State's transfer of the shorelands, the City failed to meet the condition that it keep and acquire such land as was necessary for it to permit the construction of a boathouse. Since this breach occurred in 1913, the grantor had a reasonable amount of time after 1913 to declare a forfeiture and reenter the deeded property. Metropolitan Park Dist. v. Rigney, 65 Wn.2d 788, 399 P.2d 516 (1965). Since no action was taken by the grantor or his successor until 1983, the power of termination had long since expired.\nTherefore, we reverse and the suit is dismissed.\nUtter, Brachtenbach, Dolliver, and Andersen, JJ., and Cunningham and Hamilton, JJ. Pro Tern., concur."

    "Grady, J.\nB. A. Andrews and Violet Andrews, his wife, brought this action against F. E. McCutcheon, doing business under the name of Family Shoe Store, and Ferol Fellows, doing business under the name of Family Beauty Salon, and Douglas Fellows, her husband, to recover damages as the result of personal injuries sustained by Mrs. Andrews when she fell while descending a stairway leading from the beauty parlor.\nA trial before the court and a jury resulted in a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs and against defendant McCutcheon. A motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, for a new trial, was made by defendant McCutcheon, which the court denied, and, from the judgment entered on the verdict, he has taken this appeal.\nThe material facts which the jury was justified in finding in support of its verdict are as follows: The appellant occupied and operated a shoe store on the ground floor of a building in the city of Yakima. To the rear of the building was a balcony, and leading to it from the ground floor was a stairway. In 1936, the appellant leased the balcony to Mrs. Fellows for use as a beauty parlor. At the time the lease was made, and when possession of the leased premises was taken, the appellant stated to her that he would maintain the stairs. When the lease expired, and on February 1, 1939, the appellant re-leased the premises to Mrs. Fellows for a term of five years, the lease, which was prepared by appellant, being substantially the same as the previous one except that the rent was increased.\nWhen the new lease was made, nothing was said about the stairway or its maintenance. The appellant admitted, when speaking of the stairs, that it was necessary for him to furnish a way whereby Mrs. Fellows and her customers could get to and from the balcony, and that it was his duty to fix the stairs if anything happened to them. During the time Mrs. Fellows occupied the balcony, the appellant\u2019s employees, with his consent, tightened down the metal strips whenever it became necessary, and periodically swept and kept the stairs clean.\nThe patrons of the beauty parlor entered the shoe store of appellant from the street, passed through the same to the rear, and then up the stairway to the balcony. The stairway in question was three feet in width, the steps- thereof eleven inches wide and seven inches high. The steps were covered with linoleum, and at the outer edge of each a corrugated metal strip was laid and fastened down with screws. At the time Mrs. Andrews was injured, the metal strips on some of the steps, and particularly the one on which she slipped, had become worn smooth by long use, were loose, and the inner edge was elevated approximately one eighth of an inch off the linoleum. The screws were loose in some of the strips and protruded upwards an eighth of an inch, and, at times when the screws had been tightened, indentations were made in the strips and caused the inner edge to be somewhat elevated, or raised, from the linoleum.\nOn June 11, 1941, Mrs. Andrews and a Mrs. Smith went to the beauty parlor to ascertain its service charges. Mrs. Smith preceded the respondent down the stairs by a few steps. When respondent reached either the second or third step from the top, she stepped down to the next step with her right foot, placing the ball of that foot on the metal strip thereof and her heel on the linoleum. While she was taking the next step with her left foot, her right foot slipped on the metal strip, her right heel caught on the inner raised edge of the metal strip, and she fell, sustaining substantial injuries.\nThe case was tried and presented to the jury on the part of respondents Andrews from a three-fold aspect: (1) That the appellant leased to Mrs. Fellows the balcony in the building in which he operated his shoe store, and, in order to reach it, customers of the beauty parlor used a stairway at the rear left end of the shoe store, which stairway was maintained jointly by the appellant and Mrs. Fellows in a negligent manner; (2) that the appellant, when he leased the balcony, reserved control over the stairway and agreed to maintain and keep it in a good state of repair; and (3) that, if the appellant, when he leased the balcony to Mrs. Fellows, also leased with it the stairway, it was the duty of Mrs. Fellows and husband to exercise ordinary care in maintaining the stairway.\nThe theory of the appellant was that he leased both the balcony and the stairway, as an appurtenant thereto, and owed no duty to the tenant or her invitees to maintain or keep the stairway in repair.\nThe court submitted these respective theories to the jury, and, by its verdict, the jury found that the duty to maintain and keep the stairs in a safe condition was on the part of the appellant. There is sufficient evidence, as appears from the foregoing statement of facts, to have warranted the jury in concluding and finding that it was the intention of the parties, when the lease was originally made, and in the continued relationship of landlord and tenant, that the appellant would, and did, lease the balcony to Mrs. Fellows, and that he, appellant, would maintain the stairway for her use and the use of her invitees.\nIn order to enjoy the use of the balcony, it was necessary that the tenant and her invitees have the use of the entrance to the building from the street and that they have the use of sufficient of the shoe store to get to the stairway, but it cannot be assumed that the lease covered other than a right of user as a means of ingress and egress. When the appellant stated to Mrs. Fellows that he would maintain the stairs, coupled with his conduct in keeping them clean along with his shoe store, his fastening down the metal strips when they became loose, his expressed recognition that it was his duty to furnish a way whereby the tenant and her customers could get to and from the balcony, and his admission that it was his duty to fix the stairs if anything happened to them, it would seem clear that it was his intention not only to lease the balcony but also to supply and maintain all the necessary means of ingress thereto and egress therefrom.\nIt is a general rule of law that, when premises are leased, a stairway necessary to be used with them, and which is intended shall be for the exclusive use of the tenant and his invitees, passes as an appurtenant to the leased premises and is covered by the lease, though not specifically mentioned or described therein; but, when premises are leased to several ten-v ants and it is necessary, in the enjoyment thereof, that they use a common stairway and no mention is made of it when the lease is made, it is not deemed to be appurtenant to the leased premises and covered by the lease, but the tenants and their invitees have the right to use the same as a means of access to the leased property.\nThe landlord may expressly or impliedly reserve control over the stairway in those cases where it is for the exclusive use of a single tenant and his invitees, or he may expressly or impliedly include a stairway in his leases to the several tenants and make it a part of the leased premises. As to whether or not this has been done in either case, is a question of fact. When the landlord either expressly or impliedly reserves control over the stairway, whether there be one tenant or several, the tenant or tenants will be protected in his or their right to the use of the stairway, and the landlord has the legal duty to keep and maintain the stairway in a reasonably good and safe condition for use by such tenants and their invitees.\nThe foregoing rules of law are announced and discussed in the following cases: Lindbloom v. Berkman, 43 Wash. 356, 86 Pac. 567; Konick v. Champneys, 108 Wash. 35, 183 Pac. 75, 6 A. L. R. 459; Johnson v. Smith, 114 Wash. 311, 194 Pac. 997; McGinnis v.

Jur., Landlord and Tenant, p. 165, \u00a7 170, p. 564, \u00a7 689, p. 567, \u00a7 691.\nThe trial court, by instructions which clearly and correctly stated the law, submitted the factual question to the jury as to whether the appellant retained control over the stairway in a manner similar to that which he exercised over the ground floor of the building used for his shoe store. By its verdict, the jury found that the appellant did retain such control. There is ample evidence in the record from which the jury could have found that the appellant did not keep and maintain the stairway in a reasonably safe condition for use by the respondent, who was an invitee of the tenant.\nWe feel that we have discussed all the assignments of error advanced by appellant that are of substantial merit. Many of the cases cited by him relate to the theory that the stairway was a part of the leased premises and under the control of the tenant. But, as we are deciding the case upon the other theory, which we think is the applicable one, a discussion of appellant\u2019s argument and authorities would serve no useful purpose.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nSimpson, C. J., Beals, Blake, and Robinson, JJ., concur."

    "Wright, J.\nThe question here is whether a house is a 2-story building with basement or a 3-story building. The answer depends upon the manner in which \"grade\" is defined.\nIn December 1975, the respondent, Western Home Builders, Inc., was employed to build a dwelling house for respondents Locke; on December 29, 1975, Western applied for a building permit from the City of Lake Forest Park. The permit application and the permit (No. 394) erroneously stated the permit was for a 3-story house with a basement. The Lake Forest Park ordinances provided for no more than 2 stories and 30 feet in height. Based upon the language of the application and permit the petitioners started an action and obtained a temporary injunction prohibiting construction of the proposed building. A bond in the sum of $1,000 was required as a condition for the temporary injunction.\nThereafter the temporary injunction was dissolved by agreement of the parties. It also was agreed that respondents' damages, if any damages were allowed, would be $1,000, the face amount of the injunction bond.\nRespondents Locke and Western applied for and obtained a new building permit (No. 398) which authorized a 2-story building with a basement.\nOriginally, petitioners claimed that the building exceeded both the 30-feet and the 3-story limitations. Subsequently, the claim of exceeding 30 feet was abandoned; petitioners rely solely on the claim the building is more than the 2-story maximum. It is, therefore, necessary to consider only that contention.\nThe trial court found in favor of respondents (defendants) and dismissed the complaint. The trial court also granted judgment for respondents on the injunction bond. The Court of Appeals affirmed.\nIn 1974 Lake Forest Park enacted ordinance No. 214 which defined the words \"grade\", \"story\" and \"basement\". An ordinance a year earlier, No. 204, defined \"grade\" but did not define \"story\". The same result is reached using either definition of \"grade\".\nThe definition contained in ordinance No. 214 is:\nGrade (Adjacent Ground Elevation) is the lowest point of elevation of the finished surface of the ground, paving or sidewalk within the area between the building and the property line, or when the property line is more than 5 feet from the building, between the building and a line 5 feet from the building.\nUBC \u00a7 408.\nPetitioners rely upon that provision in contending \"grade\" is the one lowest point anywhere around the building and within 5 feet thereof. That interpretation produces absurd results and ignores other language in the ordinance. It is a rule of construction that a statute or ordinance is not construed so as to reach an absurd result. Yakima First Baptist Homes, Inc. v. Gray, 82 Wn.2d 295, 301, 510 P.2d 243 (1973); Lend v. Seattle, 63 Wn.2d 664, 671, 388 P.2d 926 (1964); In re Horse Heaven Irr. Dist., 11 Wn.2d 218, 226, 118 P.2d 972 (1941). Every part of an act should be given effect if possible. State ex rel. Wilson v. King County, 7 Wn.2d 104, 108, 109 P.2d 291 (1941); McKenzie v. Mukilteo Water Dist., 4 Wn.2d 103, 112, 102 P.2d 251 (1940); Chlopeck Fish Co. v. Seattle, 64 Wash. 315, 322-23, 117 P. 232 1911).\nAbsurd Result. The possibility of an absurd result is great from using the one lowest point anywhere in the area adjacent to the building. If an outside entrance into the basement exists that entrance extends to the basement floor and, thus, probably more than 6 feet below the basement ceiling. This situation results in a basement being classified as a \"story\" even if the basement is otherwise almost wholly underground. A similar situation exists if there is an excavation to admit light and air to a basement window. These results obviously were not intended in the enactment of ordinance No. 214.\nGiving Effect to the Entire Enactment. Other language in the ordinance is ignored and given no effect if the meaning advocated by petitioners is adopted. \"Story\" is defined in part at Uniform Building Code \u00a7 420 as:\nthat portion of a building included between the upper surface of any floor and the upper surface of the floor next above ... If the finished floor level directly above a basement, cellar or unused under-floor space is more than 6 feet above grade as defined herein for more than 50 percent of the total perimeter or is more than 12 feet above grade as defined herein at any point, such basement, cellar or unused under-floor space shall be considered as a story.\nIf petitioners' construction is adopted, the 50 percent and 12-feet provisions become meaningless and superfluous.\nThe correct meaning of \"grade\" is stated by the Court of Appeals:\nThere is a more realistic reading of \"grade\": each point along the outside of a building has its own \"grade,\" which is the lowest point of elevation, along a line running perpendicular to the side of the building, on the building lot within 5 feet of the building. Just as there is an infinite number of points on the outside of a building, so is there an infinite number of \"grades,\" one for each point on the building. To determine whether a basement is a \"story,\" one measures the distance between the finished floor level directly above the basement and the \"grade\" that corresponds to that particular point on the outside of the building. Then one moves to another point along the outside of the building, and measures the distance, at that point, between the finished floor level and the \"grade\" that corresponds to that particular point on the outside of the building. After this is done around the total perimeter of the house, it can be determined whether the floor level directly above the basement is more than 6 feet above grade for more than 50 percent of the building's perimeter.\nKnappett v. Locke, 19 Wn. App. 586, 590-91, 576 P.2d 1327 (1978).\nAs to the Lockes' counterclaim for damages resulting from the temporary injunction, the trial court was correct. We adopt the Court of Appeals analysis:\nThe Knappetts, who were required by the court, pursuant to RCW 7.40.080 and CR 65(c), to post a $1,000 bond in order to obtain the February 5 temporary injunction, argue that the injunction was rightfully issued because the first building permit, on its face, was for a 3-story house. True, it was, but the test is not whether the injunction was erroneous on its face, but whether it is later determined that the restraint was erroneous in the sense that it would not have been ordered had the court been presented all of the facts. Swiss Baco Skyline Logging Co. v. Haliewicz, 14 Wn. App. 343, 541 P.2d 1014 (1975). When all of the facts were made known at the trial, the first permit, purporting to describe a 3-story house plus a basement, was obviously the result of a clerical error, and the trial court so found.

    "Weaver, C. J.\nThe trial court granted an involuntary nonsuit at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case. Plaintiff appeals from a judgment dismissing his action with prejudice.\nPlaintiff originally owned a tract of land, the southeasterly portion of which was a natural embankment sloping down to and including the adjacent tide lands in the Des-Chutes waterway in the city of Olympia. A portion of plaintiff\u2019s property below the embankment was subject to a thirty-foot railroad right of way traversed by a wooden trestle supporting a single railroad track. Plaintiff\u2019s home is at the top of the embankment.\nIn 1947, the legislature authorized the DesChutes Basin project. Its purpose was to improve that portion of the DesChutes river and its tidelands lying west and north of the present state capitol grounds. The primary feature of the project was to create Capitol lake by the construction of a dam and to construct parkways, causeways, streets, and highways around the lake. The statute authorized relocating and rerouting of railroad lines. Laws of 1947, ch. 186, p. 821; RCW 79.24.100 et seq.\nFebruary, 1950, by eminent domain, the state acquired a portion of plaintiff\u2019s land at the foot of a natural embankment, together with the tidelands, for use in the DesChutes Basin project.\nThereafter, the state constructed a fill upon the lands acquired from plaintiff. A civil engineer testified that\n\u201c . . . the area where the trestle existed was filled in and it [the fill] carried on back on an elevation of about a foot and a half above what we call Olympia Datum to the\nThe fill serves as a base for the DesChutes parkway. The state also installed a drain in the fill to carry off surface and percolating waters from plaintiff\u2019s premises; but the drain does not carry these waters as rapidly as they were carried away prior to construction of the fill. In 1951, after the fill was in place, two additional railroad tracks were constructed between the original track and the parkway.\nIn his opening brief, plaintiff designated his first cause of action as one for\n\u201cDamages for a material reduction of the value of plaintiff\u2019s remaining land by reason of the installation and continued use of multiple railroad tracks and the presence of multiple engines, freight cars and trains.\u201d\nThe state, in its answering brief, designates plaintiff\u2019s first cause of action as\n\u201cAn action for damages for departure from binding construction plans in allowing the relocation of railroad tracks in front of appellant\u2019s [plaintiff\u2019s] premises.\u201d (Italics ours.)\nThe references in the complaint to the February, 1950, condemnation action suggest that plaintiff seeks recovery on the ground of departure from construction plans offered in that action. Moreover, a portion of plaintiff\u2019s evidence appears to have been offered in support of this theory, although the decree of condemnation entered in the prior condemnation action was not introduced in evidence. Plaintiff, however, disavowed this theory in his reply brief; hence, we need not discuss it.\nWe will, therefore, treat those portions of the complaint and the evidence which refer to the 1950 condemnation action as surplusage, and inquire whether plaintiff\u2019s evidence has established a right to relief against the state on the theory of constitutional damaging (Const., Art. I, \u00a7 16) independent of any departure from construction plans.\nParagraph V of plaintiff\u2019s first cause of action alleges:\n\u201cThat by reason of the installation and continued use of said multiple railroad tracks, plaintiff has been subjected to the presence, annoyance, smoke and noise of multiple engines, freight cars and trains immediately adjacent to his home; that the continued presence of said multiple tracks, engines, trains and railroad cars has materially reduced the value of plaintiff\u2019s remaining land; that by reason thereof, plaintiff has been damaged in the sum of $20,-000.00.\u201d\nInterpreting plaintiff\u2019s evidence in the light most favorable to him (Traverso v. Pupo, 51 Wn. (2d) 149, 316 P. (2d) 462 (1957)), we find nothing that establishes a cause of action against the state.\nIn Taylor v. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul R. Co., 85 Wash. 592, 148 Pac. 887 (1915), this court held that the jarring of buildings, the casting of smoke, sparks and soot on premises, and the emitting of gases and fumes necessarily incident to the ordinary operation of a railroad through a city, which result in depreciating the value of neighboring property, is damnum absque injuria, in the absence of negligence on the part of the railway company. This court also held that Art. I, \u00a7 16 of the Washington constitution does not authorize compensation for depreciation in value caused by a legal act which is, in law, damnum absque injuria.\nThe complaint contains no allegations of negligence on the part of the state or the railroad. The evidence does not establish a relationship between the state and the railroad, nor does it disclose how or when the railroad acquired its right of way; nor does it justify an inference of negligence on the part of the state or the railroad.\nThe trial court did not err when it dismissed with prejudice the first cause of action against the state of Washington.\nThe complaint alleges that the state, having constructed the fill heretofore described, \u201cfailed to provide proper drainage for natural waters\u201d; and thus caused said water to accumulate, which accumulation of water resulted in (1) slides and subsidence, of plaintiff\u2019s land (second cause of action); and (2) loss of ingress and egress to plaintiff\u2019s hillside property because a pathway became impassable (third cause of action). We agree with the trial court \u201cthat there is nothing about the third cause of action to distinguish it in principle from the second cause of action.\u201d\nIn his memorandum opinion, the trial judge said:\n\u201cAs to the second cause of action, this Court takes the view that the actions complained of have nothing to do with the original condemnation proceedings and are as if brought between neighboring land, owners, both private citizens.\n\u201cThere is no blocking of a water course here. The evidence is clear that the water involved in the hillside in the case is percolating water. . . . This is a case of damnum absque injuria, as much as I hate to say that.\u201d\nThe \u201cnatural waters\u201d which caused the slides and subsidence of plaintiff\u2019s hillside are described by an engineer as follows:\n\u201cWell, my analysis would be that the water table has been forced to a higher elevation [by the fill]. Of course, that has weakened the toe of the slope.\n\u201cThis fill has blocked off the drainage below the surface elevation of the fill where originally it had a chance to drain on out. Twice a day it could drain on out to zero as the tide goes out. That natural drainage has certainly been interfered with by the construction of the fill.\n\u201cBy the way, the water we speak of as coming out, it\u2019s not surface water, it\u2019s spring water, and they originally had a chance to discharge to the lower level.\n\u201cThe thing is, that there has been springs, but I think that is not surface waters there. It is water, of course as I explained, that had a chance to get out before and at a lower elevation. Now, by the fill being there, it is forced to come out at a higher elevation.\u201d (Italics ours.)\nPlaintiff\u2019s evidence establishes the \u201cnatural waters\u201d as subsurface waters. Are they percolating or are they from an underground water course?\nThe general rule is stated in 56 Am. Jur., Waters, \u00a7 103:\n\u201cIt is well settled that unless it appears that underground water in a given case flows in a defined and known channel, it will be presumed to be percolating water, and that the burden of establishing the existence of an underground stream rests upon the party who alleges such fact.\u201d\nIn Evans v. Seattle, 182 Wash. 450, 453, 47 P. (2d) 984 (1935) this court said:\n\u201cWhat we conceive to be the general rule is well stated in 67 C. J. 834:\n\u201c \u2018All underground waters are presumed to be percolating, and, to take them out of the rule with regard to such waters, the existence and course of a permanent channel must be clearly shown.\u2019 \u201d\nPlaintiff\u2019s reference to the existence of \u201csprings\u201d and \u201cspring waters\u201d falls short of being sufficient to establish the fact that the \u201cnatural waters\u201d involved are from \u201can underground stream flowing in any distinct, permanent, well-known and defined channel.\u201d Evans v. Seattle, supra, p. 456.\nPlaintiff\u2019s evidence fails to establish the existence of an underground stream.\nCounsel have not been able to refer us to a case in this jurisdiction (and we have found none) where this court has discussed the question of possible liability arising from the act of a landowners protecting his land from subsurface percolating waters. In Evans v. Seattle, supra, the factual situation was reversed: plaintiffs were denied damages for the alleged wrongful diversion of percolating underground waters, which diversion caused plaintiffs\u2019 springs to dry up. This court sustained the city\u2019s contention that\n\u201c. . . any damage suffered by the respondents [plaintiffs] was what is known to the common law as damnum absque injuria .\u201d Evans v. Seattle, supra, p. 452.\nThe rule has been long established in this jurisdiction that\n\u201cIf one in the lawful exercise of his right to control, manage or improve his own land, finds it necessary to protect it from surface water flowing from higher land, he may do so, and if damage thereby results to another, it is damnum absque injuria.\u201d Cass v. Dicks, 14 Wash. 75, 78, 44 Pac. 113 (1896)\nThe same rule finds support in: Harvey v. Northern Pac. R. Co., 63 Wash. 669, 116 Pac. 464 (1911); Wood v. Tacoma, 66 Wash. 266, 119 Pac. 859 (1911); Thorpe v. Spokane, 78 Wash. 488, 139 Pac. 221 (1914); Morton v. Hines, 112 Wash. 612, 192 Pac. 1016 (1920); DeRuwe v. Morrison, 28 Wn. (2d) 797, 184 P. (2d) 273 (1947).\nSince a landowner, in the lawful exercise of his right to improve his own land, may protect it from surface waters without liability (Cass v. Dick, supra), no reason occurs to us why he should be liable for the result of lawful acts, upon his own land, which impede the flow of underground percolating waters. 56 Am. Jur., Waters, \u00a7 111, p. 594. If damages result to another, it is damnum absque injuria.\nPlaintiff contends that the doctrine of damnum absque injuria does not apply to cases where there has been a constitutional damaging of property. We do not agree. This court has held that Art. I, \u00a7 16 of our constitution does not create a cause of action where none existed under the doctrine of damnum absque injuria. Taylor v. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. P. R. Co., 85 Wash. 592, 148 Pac. 887 (1915); Aubol v. Tacoma, 167 Wash. 442, 9 P. (2d) 780 (1932); DeKay v. North Yakima & Valley R. Co., 71 Wash. 648, 129 Pac. 574 (1913); Smith v. St. Paul Etc. R. Co., 39 Wash. 355, 81 Pac. 840 (1905).\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nDonworth, Rosellini, Ott, and Hunter, JJ., concur."

    "Finley, J.\nThis is an action by petitioner Wandermere against the State Department of Highways to restrain and enjoin the department from making certain improvements to an existing drainage facility until such time as petitioner\u2019s damages have been ascertained \u201cin the manner provided by law.\u201d\nIn January, 1970, the Department of Highways published notice of intent to hold a design hearing regarding proposed construction of a storm drainage facility. The project consisted of improvements to existing drainage facilities adjacent, inter alia, to U.S. 395, a primary state highway in Spokane County. The facility is designed to capture run-off waters from U.S. 395 and water from catch basins in the area, in addition to receiving waters from a connecting storm sewer system. These waters are then transported through the improved facility and are discharged into the Little Spokane River.\nThe department\u2019s notice described the proposed drainage facility as consisting of a completely underground sewer line to be constructed entirely within the boundaries of existing state-owned highway right-of-way limits. Petitioner Wandermere\u2019s property abuts the highway, U.S. 395, for a distance of approximately 1 mile. The described project design was approved and a contract was awarded in early August, 1970. Construction of the project \u2014 which is of some magnitude \u2014 commenced several miles south and east of petitioner\u2019s property. Work progressed without incident and according to plans for some 2% months. In late October, 1970 \u2014 when project construction had reached a point some 1,100 to 1,200 feet south of the Wandermere property \u2014petitioner observed that, although a ditch had been excavated, no pipe was, in fact, being laid.\nPetitioner immediately confronted representatives of the Department of Highways and was thereupon informed that, due to a change in plans, the facility would not consist of an underground sewer line in the immediate proximity of petitioner Wandermere\u2019s property. Rather, the facility, as it abutted petitioner\u2019s land, was to consist of an open drainage ditch, varying in width from 20 to 48 feet and in depth from 5 to 8 feet.\nAt this point, \u201cthe race was on,\u201d in a manner of speaking, with petitioner attempting to move the cogs of restraining-injunctive legal machinery faster than respondent could move its bulldozers and other equipment. Petitioner sought immediate judicial relief by requesting 'an injunction to restrain respondent Department of Highways\u2019 work on the project until such time as petitioner Wandermere\u2019s damages had been determined \u201cin the manner provided by law.\u201d Up to the date set for the trial court\u2019s hearing on petitioner\u2019s complaint, no construction on the contemplated, revised highway project had occurred in the immediate proximity of petitioner\u2019s property, with the exception of some preliminary clearing.\nThe trial court was convinced that the completed drainage ditch would result in some damage to petitioner\u2019s right of access to the highway. However, the trial court concluded that a balancing of the equities and the availability of legal remedies to petitioner, potentially in the form of an action for inverse condemnation, justified denial of the injunction. The court\u2019s denial was conditioned upon:\n1. The State of Washington submit [ting] to the jurisdiction of [the Spokane County Superior] court and in the alternative, appear [ing] 'and defend [ing] in the present action for damages or fil[ing] a condemnation action for the Wandermere property within 30 days, and\n2. That the provisions of RCW Section 8.25.070 regarding attorneys\u2019 and expert witness fees apply to said damage action.\nPetitioner first attempted to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling by filing a petition for writ of review in the Court of Appeals. After initially determining that it lacked jurisdiction in the matter, the Court of Appeals, on reconsideration, certified the cause to this court. We approved this sound procedure followed by the appellate court and issued a writ of certiorari to the trial court on February 11, 1971. We additionally ordered that further proceedings in the trial court be stayed pending our review of the matter. In the interim period, respondent Department of Highways continued construction of the drainage facility adjacent to petitioner Wandermere\u2019s property to the extent that the facility, at that point, is now completed and, apparently, fully operational.\nPetitioner\u2019s initial contention upon the review here is that the actions of respondent Department of Highways amount to a constitutional taking of petitioner\u2019s access rights within the meaning of Const, art. 1, \u00a7 16 (amendment 9). Thus, in this regard, it is petitioner\u2019s contention that the Department of Highways is constitutionally required (1) to seek an order adjudicating public use and necessity, and (2) to pay ascertained damages before it can legally undertake construction of the questioned drainage facility.\nConst, art. 1, \u00a7 16 (amendment 9) provides, in relevant part:\nNo private property shall be taken or damaged for public or private use without just compensation having been first made or paid into court for the owner, and no right-of-way shall be appropriated to the use of any corporation other than municipal until full compensation therefor be first made in money, or ascertained and paid into court for the owner, . . . Whenever an attempt is made to take private property for a use alleged to be public, the question whether the contemplated use be really public shall be a judicial question, and determined as such, without regard to any legislative assertion that the use is public: . . .\n(Italics ours.)\nThe conceptual distinction between \u201ctaking\u201d and \u201cdamaging\u201d is far from clear-cut. Earlier decisions of this court generally distinguish the two concepts in the following manner:\n[OJther constitutions, including our own, . . . include both terms, \u201ctaken\u201d \u00a1and \u201cdamaged.\u201d Where both terms are included, the word \u201cdamaged\u201d should be held to cover injuries to property where there is no direct faking of the land itself; that is, where the owner is not deprived of title to any of the land, but where the land has been so injured or damaged as to cause a direct loss to the owner.\nMilwaukee Terminal Ry. v. Seattle, 86 Wash. 102, 107, 149 P. 644 (1915). See also, Fenton v. Seattle, 132 Wash. 194, 231 P. 795 (1925); Compton v. Seattle, 38 Wash. 514, 80 P. 757 (1905); Swope v. Seattle, 36 Wash. 113, 78 P. 607 (1904).\nThe above distinction has, however, been subjected to increasing challenge and judicial analysis on the basis that government is responsible for interference with the right, use, and enjoyment of private property whether such interference is to be characterized as a \u201ctaking\u201d or as a \u201cdamaging.\u201d In Ackerman v. Port of Seattle, 55 Wn.2d 400, 409, 348 P.2d 664, 77 A.L.R.2d 1344 (1960), this court quoted with approval Spann v. Dallas, 111 Tex. 350, 355, 235 S.W. 513, 19 A.L.R. 1387 (1921):\nProperty in a thing consists not merely in its ownership and possession, but in the unrestricted right of use, enjoyment and disposal. Anything which destroys any of these elements of property, to that extent destroys the property itself. The substantial value of property lies in its use. If the right of use be denied, the value of the property is annihilated and ownership is rendered a barren right.\n(Italics ours.) See also, Martin v. Port of Seattle, 64 Wn.2d 309, 391 P.2d 540 (1964); Cummins v. King County, 72 Wn.2d 624, 434 P.2d 588 (1967).\nMore recent decisions of this court clearly indicate that the earlier conceptual distinction between \u201ctaking\u201d and \u201cdamaging\u201d based upon the traditional definition of \u201cdirect\u201d as opposed to \u201cno direct\u201d physical invasion is no longer viable. Hence, such an approach is unacceptable in terms of both traditional and socially desirable judicial responsibility and authority in that area of the law commonly designated as \u201cconstitutional interpretation.\u201d This view has been recognized by the United States Supreme Court. In United States v. Cress, 243 U.S. 316, 61 L. Ed. 746, 37 S. Ct. 380 (1917), the court stated: \u201c[I]t is the character of the invasion, not the amount of damage resulting from it, so long as the damage is substantial, that determines the question whether it is a taking.\u201d See also, United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256, 90 L. Ed. 1206, 66 S. Ct. 1062 (1946).\nIt is thus apparent that the distinction between the two concepts \u2014 \u201ctaking\u201d and \u201cdamaging\u201d \u2014 must be determined by the \u201cquality\u201d or \u201ccharacter\u201d of the governmental interference. Where such interference is mere happenstance, fortuitous or of inconsequential dimension, that interference may properly be classified as a \u201cdamaging.\u201d Where, however, the character of the governmental interference with private property rights is planned, deliberate and substantial, such interference, upon proper factual showing, should be deemed a \u201ctaking\u201d \u2014 thereby requiring prior adjudication of public use and necessity under Const, art. 1, \u00a7 16 (amendment 9).\nThe characterization of these concepts developed and applied in Ackerman, Martin, and Cummins arose in the context of actions for \u201cinverse condemnation.\u201d Thus, in these cases, the question of public use and necessity was not at the outset presented for judicial determination. Rather, that question was determined after the fact of governmental fiat and action \u2014 i.e., positive governmental interference with private property rights absent any prior judicial determination \u2014 and the only remaining issue in the above-mentioned cases involved an after-the-fact allowance and determination of appropriate compensation to the private property owner.\nIn the instant case, respondent department\u2019s alleged interference with petitioner Wandermere\u2019s property rights had not transpired \u2014 except for certain inconsequential preliminary work \u2014 prior to petitioner\u2019s attempt to secure an injunction. Thus, we are faced with the unique question, whether drainage facility improvements, to be constructed entirely upon state-owned primary state highway right-of-way amount to a governmental interference with access rights of adjacent private property to the extent that such interference amounts to a constitutional \u201ctaking\u201d requiring prior adjudication of public use and necessity.\nAfter considerable deliberation, we are unable to conclude upon the facts of the instant case that the actions of respondent Department of Highways amount to a \u201ctaking\u201d of petitioner Wandermere\u2019s property rights within the meaning of Const, art. 1, \u00a7 16 (amendment 9). In the instant case, it must be noted that the drainage facility will not eliminate any present physical access of petitioner Wandermere to the state highway, U.S. 395, nor will the project deprive the petitioner of any of its legal rights to construct access to said highway or make the construction of such access impossible. At most, the facility will render construction of highway access by petitioner more costly, and, collaterally, will increase the state\u2019s liability and the expenditure of public funds for damages.\nThus, we conclude that the \u201ccharacter\u201d of respondent Department of Highways\u2019 interference with petitioner\u2019s property rights does not amount to a \u201ctaking,\u201d and respondent was not, in an absolute constitutional context, required to seek an order adjudicating public use and necessity prior to construction of the drainage facility improvement.\nOur conclusion above is not intended to imply that the Department of Highways was precluded from seeking such a prior adjudication of public use and necessity. Nor do we mean to imply that such action by the respondent would not have been a more prudent course of action. To the contrary, it may be noted that the Department of Highways possesses clear statutory authority to seek orders adjudicating public use and necessity in connection with projects of the instant kind. RCW 47.12.010 provides, in relevant part:\nWhenever it is necessary to secure any lands or interests in land for a right of way for any state highway, or for the drainage thereof or construction of a protection therefor . . . the highway commission is authorized to acquire such lands or interests in land in behalf of the state by gift, purchase or condemnation. In case of condemnation to secure such lands or interests in land, the action shall be brought in the name of the state of Washington in the manner provided for the acquiring of property for the public uses of the state, . . .\n(Italics ours.)\nThe determination of whether a given governmental interference with private property rights constitutes a \u201ctaking\u201d or a \u201cdamaging\u201d is a complex determination depending upon the unique facts of each given case. This determination is a judicial question. Thus, where private property owners advance good faith contentions that the state\u2019s actions will amount to a \u201ctaking,\u201d it is most highly desirable that the Department of Highways avail itself of the authority and the procedure delineated in RCW 47.12.010. Prior adjudication of the question would avoid the possibility that the state may incorrectly assess the \u201ccharacter\u201d of its interference as amounting to a \u201cdamaging\u201d rather than a \u201ctaking.\u201d Such incorrect determinations regarding the nature of the interference \u2014 made or assumed by the highway department \u201csua sponte\u201d \u2014 may both result in depriving the property owner of his full constitutional protections and in subjecting the state to a subsequent and considerably more costly finding that its actions \u2014 rather than mere \u201cdamaging\u201d \u2014 constitute a \u201ctaking for public use.\u201d\nIndeed, the instant case demonstrates the wisdom of prior adjudication of the question of public use and necessity. Petitioner Wandermere, in addition to alleging injury to its highway access rights, further contends that the revised project \u2014 consisting of an open drainage ditch \u2014 will seriously harm valuable interests and rights in an existing underground water table beneath its property. It is not inconceivable that proper showing could have been made at trial that the \u201ccharacter\u201d of the state\u2019s interference with such rights in the instant case amounted to a \u201ctaking\u201d of those rights.\nHaving determined that petitioner Wandermere is not entitled to an adjudication of public use and necessity regarding respondent department\u2019s interference with petitioner\u2019s highway access rights, we now consider whether petitioner was entitled to an injunction pending determination (1) of its alleged damages to highway access, or (2) of the \u201ccharacter\u201d of respondent department\u2019s interference with its interests and rights in the underground water table.\nIn this regard, petitioner argues that Brown v. Seattle, 5 Wash. 35, 31 P. 313, 32 P. 214 (1892), is determinative. Brown involved damages to private property abutting a city street as the result of a change in street grade. Therein, this court held that, under Const, art. 1, \u00a7 16, the property owner\nhad a right to have [the] damage ascertained by a jury and paid to her before the work was done, if the damage thus sustained would leave her property less valuable to sell or rent than it was before; . . .\n(Italics ours.) Brown v. Seattle, 5 Wash, at 43. Respondent Department of Highways argues that Brown is distinguishable on the ground that the governmental acts involved therein had not transpired prior to petitioner Brown\u2019s securance of an injunction.\nWe find no merit in the distinction suggested by the respondent. It is true that some work had been performed on the project in the immediate vicinity of petitioner Wan-dermere\u2019s land as of the date set for the trial court\u2019s hearing on petitioner\u2019s complaint. However, it is clear from the record, that petitioner Wandermere first contacted the department regarding its (Wandermere\u2019s) objection to the plan change prior to any construction adjacent to petitioner\u2019s land.\nFurthermore, it is obvious that the work in the immediate vicinity of petitioner\u2019s land \u2014 which consisted of some mere clearing \u2014 was insufficient to defeat petitioner Wan-dermere\u2019s right to an injunction (assuming petitioner was otherwise entitled to such relief), upon the ground that once the state wrongfully \u201ctakes\u201d private land it will not be ousted, and the property owner will be left to his legal remedies. See State ex rel. Peel v. Clausen, 94 Wash. 166, 162 P. 1 (1917). Indeed, were we to hold otherwise \u2014 i.e., that respondent\u2019s minor preliminary work defeated petitioner\u2019s right to an injunction \u2014 we would, as petitioner suggests, be sanctioning a \u201cfleet of foot\u201d doctrine; i.e., \u201cnotwithstanding the constitutional mandate that damages be determined and paid prior to the damaging, if the state can build faster than the property owner can litigate, then the question becomes moot.\u201d\nThe constitutional provision (Const, art. 1, \u00a7 16 (amendment 9)) is clear, unambiguous and apparent as to its intended meaning:\nNo private property shall be taken or damaged for public or private use without just compensation having been first made, or paid into court for the owner, . . .\n(Italics ours.) It cannot be seriously disputed that petitioner Wandermere made a showing of damage. Respondent Department of Highways concedes \u2014 and it is obvious on the face of the record \u2014 that the completed ditch will make any construction of access by petitioner more costly. Additionally, petitioner Wandermere alleged, and was entitled to the opportunity to prove, that the open ditch would seriously damage or constitute a taking of valuable interests and rights in an existing underground water table.\nIn short, we conclude that petitioner Wandermere was entitled to an injunction prohibiting the Department of Highways from further construction of the drainage facility until such time as petitioner\u2019s damages had been ascertained and paid, and the \u201ccharacter\u201d of respondent department\u2019s interference with petitioner\u2019s interests in the underground water table had been established. The injunction could, and we think should, have been granted by the trial court in the instant case.\nNevertheless, any victory in this regard by petitioner at the present stage of the proceedings may be rendered a somewhat \u201cPyrrhic\u201d one, for it would indeed be a futile and useless gesture for this court now to prohibit and enjoin an activity which is completed. While it is true that this court will, by mandate, compel the undoing of acts which have been illegally done (Farnsworth v. Wilbur, 49 Wash. 416, 95 P. 642, 19 A.L.R. 320 (1908)), respondent\u2019s actions in completing the project during the pendency of this litigation were not illegal in an ultimate and compelling constitutional sense. We have previously held that, upon denial of a temporary restraining order, the defending party may assume that it has the right to proceed with the construction sought to be enjoined. Steele v. Queen City Broadcasting Co., 54 Wn.2d 402, 341 P.2d 499 (1959). Additionally, in the instant case, petitioner\u2019s alleged damages may be fully determined and adjudicated upon remand.\nFor the reasons indicated, the case should be remanded for determination of petitioner\u2019s damages. It is so ordered.\nHamilton, C.J., Rosellini, Hunter, Hale, Sharp, and Wright, JJ., and Ryan, J. Pro Tern., concur.\nNeill, J., concurs in the result.\nPetition for rehearing denied November 11, 1971."

    "\u00b61 \u2014 We must decide whether continuing trespass damages incurred after a case is filed may be recovered in the original action. This particular question has not been considered by this court before. The trial court awarded damages from three years before the action was filed until at least the time of trial, slightly more than six years. The Court of Appeals, construing several of our previous decisions on continuing trespass, concluded our case law demands a limitation on damages to the period of three years before the case was filed, requiring that a party file a new lawsuit every three years.\nChambers, J.\n\u00b62 We recognize that our previous holdings may have misled the Court of Appeals. We clarify and hold that continuing trespass damages are available from the beginning of the trespass, but no more than three years before the filing of the lawsuit, until the trial begins. Successive lawsuits are permitted if the trespass is not abated following trial, so long as there is no double recovery of damages. We reverse the Court of Appeals and remand to the trial court for determination of damages up to the point of trial.\nFACTS\n\u00b63 Myrtle Woldson and John Woodhead are neighbors. Their houses were built in 1915 and 1917, respectively. A rubble masonry wall dividing the properties was built around the time the homes were constructed. The wall is approximately 170 feet long, 3 1/2 feet high, and 15 inches deep. It runs north to south, and most of it is located on Woldson\u2019s property. The entire length of the wall is mortared, but the wall has a very loose core and interstitial spaces are not filled with mortar.\n\u00b64 During the 1960s, fill dirt was used to artificially raise the level of Woodhead\u2019s property. The rubble masonry wall became a retaining wall for the extra dirt on Wood-head\u2019s land, a use not contemplated by its original design. Woodhead was not himself the cause of the wall\u2019s conversion; this was done by prior owners of the land who later built a carport next to the wall. Subsequent owners built a garage using the carport as a base, increasing the pressure exerted against the wall. The Woldson family purchased their home in 1943, and Myrtle has lived there since that time. Woodhead purchased his home in 1986.\n\u00b65 Over time, Woldson\u2019s basalt wall crumbled and cracked due to lateral earth pressure exerted against the wall by Woodhead\u2019s dirt. As the fill dirt stressed the wall, it seems it also strained the harmony between the neighbors. At any rate, Woldson filed a lawsuit on July 7, 2000, claiming a nuisance; an unlawful taking under article I, section 16 of the state constitution; and a continuing trespass. All but the continuing trespass claim were dismissed at summary judgment as barred by the statute of limitations. Woodhead\u2019s motion to dismiss the trespass claim was denied because the court found that \u201cthe action of placing fill dirt on the east side of the Plaintiff\u2019s basalt wall is a trespass.\u201d Clerk\u2019s Papers at 68. The court also held that damages were limited by the statute of limitations; only those damages incurred from three years prior to the filing date up until judgment could be recovered. Trial was set to determine damages.\n\u00b66 The trial began in August 2003. The trial court relied upon expert testimony and concluded that 90 feet of the wall appeared to be in fairly good condition and about 80 linear feet of the wall should be replaced. The court concluded the cost to remove and replace that portion of the wall to be $885 per foot or $70,762. The court found that 45 percent of the damage to the wall occurred within the applicable limitations period. Although the court authorized damages up until judgment, it appears from the record damages were actually calculated only for injuries sustained before trial. Woldson was awarded $33,353 in damages.\n\u00b67 Woodhead appealed the award to the Court of Appeals, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion that the statute of limitations allows recovery for damages sustained beyond the date of filing. In an unpublished opinion, the lower court found sufficient evidence but reversed on the legal question, holding:\nTypically, a plaintiff can establish her damages in one proceeding. But Washington courts have held otherwise when dealing with continuous trespass actions. These cases have restrictive limitation periods and only damages occurring within that period can be recovered. Ms. Woldson\u2019s damages are therefore limited to the period from July 7, 1997 to July 7, 2000. In order to obtain damages after July 7, 2000, she must file a successive action. The court erred by awarding her damages through the date of judgment.\nWoldson v. Woodhead, noted at 129 Wn. App. 1009, 2005 Wash. App. LEXIS 2112, at *5.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\u00b68 We are asked to review the application of ROW 4.16.080(1) to the tort of continuing trespass. This is a question of law reviewed de novo. Dep\u2019t of Ecology v. Campbell & Gwinn, LLC, 146 Wn.2d 1, 9, 43 P.3d 4 (2002).\nCONTINUING TRESPASS\n\u00b69 With most torts, a single isolated event begins the running of the statute of limitations. With most torts, past damages are those damages that accrued from the tortious event until trial or judgment. A continuing trespass tort is different; the \u201cevent\u201d happens every day the trespass continues. Every moment, arguably, is a new tort. Thus, the statute of limitations does not prevent recovery for a continuing trespass that \u201cbegan\u201d before the statutory period; instead, the statute of limitations excludes recovery for any trespass occurring more than three years before the date of filing. Further, because the continuing offending intrusion upon the property may be removed or abated at any time, future damages are inherently speculative and may not be awarded. Neither party disputes these basics.\nAUTHORITIES\nflO The question before us is whether the particular character of a continuing trespass prevents a court from awarding damages accrued between the date of filing and the date of trial or judgment. While we have touched on this issue before, we have not had occasion to decide it. We turn first to the cases relied upon by the court below.\nDoran v. City of Seattle\nf 11 In Doran v. City of Seattle, 24 Wash. 182, 64 P. 230 (1901), this court rejected the city\u2019s contention that all continuing nuisance damages, past and prospective, must be recovered in a single action and that the statute of limitations runs from the inception of the nuisance. Frank Doran was a property owner whose house, he claimed, suffered damage as a result of a negligently constructed bulkhead. The bulkhead, built by the city of Seattle, pressed against his house. Doran brought suit for nuisance in September 1897, when the statute of limitations for such a claim was two years. The city argued the statute began to run when the bulkhead first damaged Doran\u2019s property and that his claim was thus time barred.\n\u00b612 We disagreed. We held, \u201c[i]t would be inequitable and not in accordance with good morals to estop a person from obtaining his rights or damages for injuries which might eventually become burdensome, because he was not litigious enough to plunge into a law suit over a trifling matter.\u201d Id. at 188-89. The court permitted Doran to sue for the damages caused by the nuisance suffered during the two years before he brought the lawsuit.\n\u00b613 We also rejected Seattle\u2019s argument that future damages must be recovered in one action. We disapproved of awarding prospective damages in a continuing nuisance claim. \u201c[T]he wrong doer might, by the payment of prospective damages, actually become permanently possessed of real property which, under the theory of the law, can only be taken ... in relation to eminent domain.\u201d Id. at 188. This result was later endorsed by Island Lime Co. v. City of Seattle, 122 Wash. 632, 634, 211 P. 285 (1922), and Davis v. City of Seattle, 134 Wash. 1, 6-7, 235 P. 4 (1925), where we added that an award of prospective damages denied the defendant the right to mitigate damages by abating the tortious encroachment.\n\u00b614 None of these cases suggest damages should not be awarded for a nuisance (or trespass) proved to have already happened. A rejection of damages for predicted future harms is not a rejection of an award for proven damages.\nBradley v. American Smelting and Refining Company\nf 15 We turn now to a more recent case. Michael and Marie Bradley lived on Vashon Island. Microscopic airborne particles of heavy metal from American Smelting and Refining Company in Ruston had fallen on their land since 1905. In 1983, they brought suit in federal court, claiming a nuisance and continuing trespass. The federal court certified questions to this court, asking us to decide whether the pollutants constituted a trespass and what effect the statute of limitations had on the tort of continuing trespass.\nf 16 We held the factory\u2019s conduct was a trespass. Bradley v. Am. Smelting & Ref. Co., 104 Wn.2d 677, 691-92, 709 P.2d 782 (1985). As a trespass, the three-year statute of limitations set forth in RCW 4.16.080(1) applied. Id. at 693. Finally, we held, \u201cthe tort falls within the theory of continuing trespass.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). As such, damages were available within \u201cthe 3-year period preceding suit.\u201d Id. at 695.\n\u00b617 Bradley does not prevent the recovery of damages incurred after the lawsuit is filed. We recognize that the following line might cause confusion: \u201cwe find it proper to also require that damages claimed not extend past the 3-year period of limitations.\u201d Id. at 693-94.\nf 18 This is a retrospective limit. We did not limit damages to the sum total of three calendar years. Instead, we held that damages cannot be claimed past, i.e., before, the period of limitations. In other words, damages may not be claimed based on injuries sustained more than three years prior to filing.\nFradkin v. Northshore Utility District\n\u00b619 Finally, Fradkin v. Northshore Utility District, 96 Wn. App. 118, 977 P.2d 1265 (1999), involved a trespass claim brought against a utility company for negligently installing a sewer line, causing water to flood the plaintiff\u2019s property. In October 1990, Northshore Utility District, building a sewer line through Frank Fradkin\u2019s property, accidentally obstructed several drainpipes that carried rainwater from the property to a nearby creek. The loss of the drainpipes left Fradkin\u2019s property, in the words of the court, \u201cbog-like.\u201d Id. at 121. Fradkin brought a lawsuit in May 1997; the utility district claimed his action was barred by the statute of limitations.\nf20 The court noted the initial injury occurred seven years prior to filing the suit. It held that if the action were for a continuous trespass then recovery for the three years of trespass prior to filing was not barred by the statute of limitations. The court concluded, \u201cit remains an issue of fact for the jury to decide whether Northshore trespassed, and, if so, whether the trespass was continuing or permanent. If the jury finds a continuing trespass, Fradkin is not time-barred from recovering damages occurring after May 12, 1994.\u201d Id. at 126. The court did not limit recovery of damages incurred after filing the suit. Again, the only limit is retrospective; the plaintiff cannot recover for damages that happened more than three years before filing.\nCONCLUSION\n\u00b621 The Court of Appeals correctly reported the usual rule: damages that can be proved at trial are typically recovered in one proceeding. Woldson, 2005 Wash. App. LEXIS 2112, at *5. The lower court felt bound by precedent, not reason, to depart from our standard method of remedying proven harms. We conclude that the proper period for an award of damages for continuing trespass is three years before filing until the date of trial. The usual and established rule with respect to accrual of actions, proof of damages, and entry of judgment are founded on accepted and tested principles. Consistency and continuity reduces complexity in the law. Exceptions to the general rule should be based only upon compelling reasons. None appears here.\nf 22 Although the unique nature of the tort of continuing trespass requires limiting recovery to three years before filing, and although the fact the trespass can be abated at any time requires a bar against future damages, there are no sound reasons to prevent an award for proven damages between filing and trial. The facts of this case amply demonstrate the wisdom of allowing a trial court to award damages for injuries sustained after filing. Trial commenced more than three years after filing. Limiting recovery to the three years between the beginning of the statutory period and filing would require that Woldson, to preserve her rights, file a second and perhaps third lawsuit before her first lawsuit came to trial. Neither reason nor judicial economy supports such a result. However, because the trespass can be abated between trial and the entry of judgment, we limit damages to the time of trial and not judgment.\n\u00b623 With respect to the tort of continuing trespass, we hold: first, the statute of limitations does not run from the date the tort begins; it is applied retrospectively to allow recovery for damages sustained within three years of filing. Second, damages are recoverable from three years before filing until the trespass is abated or, if not abated, until the time of trial. Third, prospective damages are not allowed; if the trespass continues past trial, successive suits may be brought to remedy such injuries until the trespass ceases. Because we are unable to discern whether the trial court awarded damages until the time of trial or judgment, we reverse the Court of Appeals and remand to the trial court for determination of damages up to the point of trial and entry of judgment in favor of Woldson.\nAlexander, C.J., and C. Johnson, Madsen, Sanders, Bridge, Owens, Fairhurst, and J.M. Johnson, JJ., concur.\nThe record is unclear as to whether damages were awarded up to trial or judgment.\nWoodhead disputed this version throughout trial and at every stage of his appeal, but these facts are not under review.\nThe findings of fact indicate the court felt authorized to award damages up until judgment. Whether damages were in fact so awarded is less clear. The trial court based damages on an investigation that observed changes in the wall from 2001 to 2003. Destruction of the wall was observed to extend over 32 feet as of 2003. The judgment, entered in 2004, awarded damages based on destruction covering 30 feet (rounded). This suggests, as a practical matter, the judgment awarded damages only for injuries documented in an investigation that preceded not only the judgment but the trial. This issue must be resolved by the trial court on remand; damages in a continuing trespass may not be awarded for injuries sustained after the trial. Unlike other torts, the offending conduct and subsequent damages in a continuing trespass may be abated \u2014 the dirt, in this case, could be removed following trial but before judgment. As such, it is improper to award damages that have not been proved at trial; they are inherently prospective and, as explained below, prospective damages may not be awarded for a continuing trespass.\nThough resolving a continuing nuisance claim, Doran has been cited to support the same statute of limitations formula used for continuing trespass claims by the Supreme Court in Bradley v. American Smelting & Refining Co., 104 Wn.2d 677, 709 P.2d 702 (1985). See Fradkin v. Northshore Util. Dist., 96 Wn. App. 118, 977 P.2d 1265 (1999)."

    "Donworth, J.\nRespondents, as plaintiffs, brought this action against both the city of Seattle and Kang county to recover damages to real property caused by the invasion of surface waters. At the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, the trial court, sitting without a jury, sustained a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence interposed by the county and dismissed the case as to that defendant. The trial then proceeded with the city as sole defendant, and at the conclusion thereof the trial court rendered an oral decision in favor of the plaintiffs. The city\u2019s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the oral decision having been denied, the court entered findings of fact and judgment for the plaintiffs against the city of Seattle, from which the latter has appealed.\nRespondents were represented in the trial court and in the perfecting of their appeal by counsel other than those who appeared for them at the time of the argument in this court.\nRespondents, husband and wife, are owners of a tract of land in King county, located a few blocks north of the city limits of Seattle at the northwest corner of North 102nd street and Aurora avenue. The property is bounded on the east by Aurora avenue, on the south by North 102nd street, and on the west by an alley which runs north and south parallel to Aurora avenue. About twenty feet north of respondents\u2019 property, this alley is intersected by another alley running west to Linden avenue parallel to North 102nd street. Linden avenue, which runs northerly and southerly, is the next street to the west of Aurora avenue and intersects North 102nd street approximately one hundred yards west of respondents\u2019 property. With the exception of Aurora avenue, which is a primary state..highway, all of these streets and alleys are unpaved county roads.\nRespondents\u2019 land is improved by a store building located on the southern portion of the property, fronting on Aurora avenue, on the rear or west end of which two separate additions have been built which are used for living quarters and garage and storage purposes. The original store building has a concrete foundation wall, but the two additions rest on concrete blocks. Respondents became tenants of this property in 1942, purchased it in 1944 for five thousand dollars, and began to use the additions as their home on May 9,1946.\nIn order to understand the legal problems presented by this case, it is necessary to describe the topography of this area. North 102nd street is a graveled road which has been oiled and compacted. Immediately west of Aurora avenue, this street was graded by filling the traveled portion with gravel to an elevation somewhat higher than that of respondents\u2019 property. For a distance of one hundred fifty feet west of Aurora avenue, the street surface is almost flat, having a very slight crown. The street then begins to rise in its westerly course so that, at its intersection with Linden avenue, its elevation is about twenty-five to thirty feet higher than its elevation adjacent to respondents\u2019 property. West of Linden avenue, North 102nd street continues to rise for a considerable distance. The alley, abutting on respondents\u2019 property on the west, slopes from north to south. The general slope of the ground and the natural drainage in this vicinity is from the northwest to the southeast in the direction of respondents\u2019 property, which forms a sump or pothole.\nThe greater quantity of surface water arising on the hill to the west of respondents\u2019 property travels south on Linden avenue to North 102nd street and east down that street to Aurora avenue. Some surface water flows east down the alley between North 102nd and North 103rd streets, turns into the alley to the west of respondents\u2019 property, and runs south toward North 102nd. Except for Aurora avenue, there are no curbs, gutters, or sewers in this area for the purpose of carrying off the surface water.\nAccording to the testimony of respondent Sydney Stevens (who will be referred to as the respondent unless the context indicates otherwise), the surface wateri,had formed a small drainage ditch on the north side of North 102nd street to within one hundred feet of respondents\u2019 property, where it then leveled out. Prior to January, 1948, according to his testimony, the surface water, with one exception, had always flowed past his property without entering thereon. The single exception was in 1945, when surface water settled in a puddle on North 102nd street near the front of the store building, but the water disappeared after the county deposited gravel in that spot. In respondents\u2019 complaint, it was alleged that there had been repeated floodings of their premises since'May 9,1946, but at the trial respondent testified that this allegation was incorrect.\nOn January 20, 1948, the appellant, under a franchise from King county, commenced to lay water mains on North 102nd street connecting with an existing water main on Aurora avenue and running westward. This work was done by a contractor (to whom appellant had awarded this job) with the knowledge and under the supervision of the county engineer.\nA trench, approximately two feet wide and forty-four inches deep, was dug by appellant\u2019s contractor ten feet north of, and parallel to, the center line of the street and twenty feet from the south edge of respondents\u2019 property. The dirt was piled three or four feet high on the south side of the trench. The pipe was laid in eighteen-foot sections, and that portion of the trench was backfilled with earth and water on the same day. Two or three days later, the surface of the street was smoothed off with the blade of a \u201cscoopmobile\u201d (bulldozer with rubber tires). The surface dirt was removed by the contractor and dumped in a place remote from respondents\u2019 property.\nThe alley to the west of respondents\u2019 property was not disturbed in any manner, since no lateral pipes were laid. The job was completed in five days on January 24, 1948. Respondent testified that, after the appellant finished its installation, a barrier of dirt about one foot high was left, which remained several days, but the street was leveled before the rain came in February, 1948.\nThe evidence shows that the job was rather carefully inspected at every stage by both the appellant and King county to make certain that the street was left in the same condition that it was when the job was started. However, no measurements were taken to determine the precise level of the street either before or after the construction. Respondent testified that prior to the time appellant installed the water main the street was not in very good condition and had been neglected by the county. After flooding involved in this action, the county constructed a ditch on the north side of North 102nd street which has since conducted' surface water past respondents\u2019 property to the sewer in Aurora avenue.\nDuring the actual laying of the water main, very little rain fell, but between the 13th and 18th of February, 1948, two and thirty-five hundredths inches of rain fell in this area.\nOn February 24, 1948, respondents filed their claim for damages with the appellant city of Seattle, as well as with the county. This claim not having been acted upon within sixty days from the filing thereof, this action was thereafter commenced. Paragraphs VII, VIII and IX of this claim stated as follows:\n\u201cVII\n\u201cOn February 16, 1948, and prior and subsequent thereto, there was a substantial rainfall, and the surface waters and seepage flowing on said streets and alleys entered upon the claimants\u2019 property in great volume.\n\u201cVIII\n\u201cAs a result of the repeated flooding of claimants\u2019 premises since May 9, 1946, the soil has been gradually washed away from under the foundation walls of claimants\u2019 house and store building, causing the walls thereof to sag, causing distortions and displacements in the structure of said building. Many of the wooden timbers thereof which have been subjected to repeated water damage have become rotten, and a wooden stairway into the basement of the premises at 10207 Aurora has completely rotted out. The ground under the board walk leading from the sidewalk on North 102nd Street to claimants\u2019 front door has been washed away, causing the walk to sink. The aforesaid flooding has also damaged claimants\u2019 lawn and shrubbery.\n\u201cIX\n\u201cThe aforesaid damage has been gradual and cumulative, increasing with the flooding of claimants\u2019 property which has occurred after each rainfall.\u201d\nThe contention of respondents is that the damage complained of was caused by appellant\u2019s changing the street contours while making a public improvement which resulted in the surface water flowing down the street being diverted onto their property. They maintain that the judgment can be supported either upon the constitutional provision against damaging private property for a public use (Art. I, \u00a7 16) or upon the theory of appellant\u2019s negligence. The trial court in its oral decision indicated that respondents\u2019 recovery in this action was based on the city\u2019s negligence.\nOn the other hand, appellant contends that there is absolutely no proof that surface water was collected by it and discharged upon respondents\u2019 property in a concentrated form, and that there is no proof that the laying of the water main in North 102nd street resulted in any changing of the street contours so as to cause the flooding. Furthermore, it is argued that respondent did nothing to mitigate his damages, although he was aware of the flooding and could have protected his property at nominal expense.\nAppellant assigns as error the making of finding off fact No. VII, the failure to sustain appellant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of respondents\u2019 evidence, and the entry of judgment against the city for the sum of five hundred dollars.\nFinding No. VII reads as follows:\n\u201cAt the time defendant City performed such work on North 102nd Street, there was no substantial rainfall. Approximately in the middle of February, 1948, there was a heavy rainfall, with the result that large amounts of surface waters collected on the high ground west of plaintiffs\u2019 property, and by virtue of the crown of North 102nd Street were prevented from flowing in their natural southeasterly course, but were conducted by open ditches on Linden Avenue and North 102nd Street to the intersection of said streets and thence east down North 102nd to the flat area immediately adjacent to plaintiffs\u2019 property. By reason of the fact that defendant City had altered the contours of said street, the said surface waters thence flowed upon plaintiffs\u2019 property in large volume, causing the foundations of their said buildings to settle, with resulting damage as hereinafter described. But for the construction work done by the defendant City as aforesaid, the said waters would have continued to flow in said street until reaching Aurora Avenue, whence they would have been conducted away by adequate drainage facilities, all without damage to plaintiff, as had been formerly the case.\u201d\nWe have italicized the portion of this finding which is particularly to be .noted in connection with our discussion of the evidence in this case. Primarily, only questions of fact are here involved. North 102nd street, being outside of the city limits of Seattle, was entirely under the jurisdiction and control of King county. Therefore our decision in Kuhr v. Seattle, 15 Wn. (2d) 501, 131 P. (2d) 168 (cited by respondent), is not applicable.\nRespondent calls our attention to the well-established rule that findings of the trial court made upon conflicting evidence will not be disturbed by this court unless we can say that such findings are clearly not supported by the weight of the evidence, citing Michigan Millers Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Oregon-Washington R. & N. Co., 32 Wn. (2d) 256, 201 P. (2d) 207.\nFrom an examination of the entire record in this case, we are constrained to hold that the weight of the evidence does preponderate against the above-quoted finding. We will briefly state our reasons for so holding.\n1. Respondent\u2019s claim against the city and county as well as the complaint (both were admitted in evidence) alleged that there had been repeated floodings of the premises since May, 1946, and that the damage had been gradual and cumulative. At the trial, he testified that these statements were erroneous, but his own witness Meroney, a former neighbor, testified in his deposition that there had been repeated floodings since 1946.\n2. This finding was made in spite of the trial court\u2019s appraisal of respondent\u2019s testimony as unsatisfactory. In its oral decision, the trial court commented upon respondent\u2019s credibility as follows:\n\u201cBut I must concede to counsel that the re-reading of this plaintiff\u2019s testimony does not convince me that I would be permitted to found my conclusions upon his sometimes rather disturbing testimony. He was quite an opinionated man and at times was almost flippant, not only towards his own counsel, but towards the Court and everybody else; and it was difficult to get from him just exactly what the facts were. He was bound to argue his case, and that made his own counsel\u2019s problem somewhat difficult, as it did the rest of us.\n\u201cBut, apparently, he does not contend and does not claim to the Court that there was any dam left, a dam of loose earth left there at this point, ten feet north of the center of 102d Street at the time when the flood of -which he complains actually occurred.\u201d\nSince respondent\u2019s testimony was not considered by the trial court as adequate to support its findings, there was no credible testimony as to the essential facts to support the judgment other than that contained in the deposition of Mr. Meroney (whom the trial court did not see or hear testify). The court characterized Mr. Meroney\u2019s testimony as \u201cnot always clear and in some cases it is somewhat conflicting.\u201d The latter\u2019s testimony was outweighed by that produced by appellant.\n3. In opposition to these two witnesses, five witnesses were called by appellant, to wit, the King county district foreman, an engineer employed by the county engineer\u2019s office, the city\u2019s contractor who performed the work, the engineer in charge of the work for the city, and the district engineer for the city. All of them testified that the surface of North 102nd street in the vicinity of respondent\u2019s property was in substantially the same condition after the water main was laid as before this work was done. Thus, the weight of the evidence is to the effect that the city did not change the contours of the street.\n4. In testifying in rebuttal, respondent admitted that the ridge of earth which he claimed appellant had left in the street after this work was completed was leveled off before the heavy rain came in February, 1948. Respondent\u2019s only remaining cause of the flooding was that the city had changed the contours of the street. This is discussed in the preceding paragraph.\n5. The preponderance of the evidence does not support the above-quoted finding because respondent did not sustain the burden of proving that the laying of the water main by the city was the proximate cause of the flooding. Disregarding for the moment respondent\u2019s allegations that there had been repeated flooding since 1946, his evidence merely showed that the flooding here involved occurred during the first heavy rain subsequent to the completion of the work, whereas no flooding took place just prior to doing the work at a time when there was also considerable rainfall.\nRespondent in his brief argues that the photographs taken by him, at the time the flooding occurred, show conclusively that most of the water which damaged his premises came from North 102nd street and not from the alley which forms the westerly boundary of his property. Four of these pictures have been enlarged, and we have given all of them careful consideration. The trial court\u2019s comment regarding these pictures in its oral decision was as follows:\n\u201cBut this water, he [respondent] claims, came, in part, down the alley to the west of his property, and partly from the west. I think he suggested he thinks about five times the quantity from the west and probably one quarter from a point to the west, meeting up with one coming from this property.\n\u201cCol. Nelson [appellant\u2019s witness] seemed to think that more water had come down the west alley, east-and-west alley. I mean to a point west of the premises, and the area around east and west, probably than any other direction. But I do not think so, and I won\u2019t stop to refer to it. I think one of the pho'tographs taken so indicates. You can almost see the heavy burden of water that came down\u2019 along the north side of 102d Street.. The water in there, those pictures show the presence of water there, and convince me further of the actual presence of an unusual quantity of water; and that is confirmed as well by the testimony of both the plaintiff and his neighbor across the way. The neighbor\u2019s testimony is not always clear and in some cases it is somewhat conflicting.\n\u201cBut the conclusive and elemental fact is that there was an excess of water which was not in accordance with the prior experience of the neighborhood within recent years, or at least that is the testimony. And he is also confronted with the fact that it should fall in exact coincidence with the preliminary construction of the water-pipe line and a rather heavy fall of rain, which followed in the succeeding month.\u201d\nWhile the direction of the flow of the water is not as clearly discernible from the pictures as might be desired, nevertheless, if we assume respondent\u2019s conclusion that the water nearly all flowed onto respondent\u2019s property from North 102nd street to be correct, there would still not be sufficient evidence to support finding No. VII as to the cause of the flooding. The burden was upon respondent to prove that the city changed the contours of North 102nd street and that this change caused the flooding. The most favorable view of the evidence from respondent\u2019s standpoint amounts to no more than a mere possibility that the flooding might have been caused in this manner. This is insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding.\nIn Home Ins. Co. v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 18 Wn. (2d) 798, 140 P. (2d) 507, we had occasion to consider a rule of law which is applicable to the present case. We there said:\n\u201cThe rule is well established that the existence of a fact or facts cannot rest in guess, speculation, or conjecture. It is also the rule that the one having the affirmative of an issue does not have to make proof to an absolute certainty. It is sufficient if his evidence affords room for men of reasonable minds to conclude that there is a greater probability that the thing in question, such as the occurrence of a fire, happened in such a way as to fix liability upon the person charged therewith than it is that it happened in a way for which a person charged would not be liable. In applying the circumstantial evidence submitted to prove a fact, the trier of fact must recognize the distinction between that which is mere conjecture and what is a reasonable inference.\u201d\nMore recently, in Gardner v. Seymour, 27 Wn. (2d) 802, 180 P. (2d) 564, the same principle was stated briefly as follows:\n\u201cWe have frequently said that, if there is nothing more tangible to proceed upon than two or more conjectural theories under one or more of which a defendant would be liable and under one or more of which a plaintiff would not be entitled to recover, a jury will not be permitted to conjecture how the accident occurred.\u201d\nThis rule is equally applicable whether the trier of fact be a jury or a court sitting without a jury.\nSince w\u00bf find from the record that there is not sufficient evidence to sustain the trial court\u2019s finding that the city changed the contour of North 102nd street in such a manner as to be the proximate cause of the flooding, the respondents are not entitled to any recover"

    "Ott, J.\nIn 1936, the works progress administration, a Federal agency, constructed and installed a drainage system on property owned by King county, located in Seattle between Alki avenue and the intersection of Sunset avenue and West Seattle street. The system extends westward from a spring below Sunset avenue, and empties into Puget Sound. After the drainage system was constructed, the maintenance thereof was assumed by the city.\nThe terrain at the base of the drain, from Alki avenue east, is comparatively level for one hundred twenty feet, the depth of Lena Sigurdson\u2019s lot, except that, near the rear, there is a rise of approximately ten feet. From the rear of her lot, the elevation increases abruptly approximately two hundred ten feet in a distance of approximately two hundred sixty feet.\nThe aforementioned drainage system consists of an eight-inch wooden pipe running from Puget Sound, beneath Alki avenue, eastward across the Sigurdson lot, connecting with a sand box approximately one hundred feet to the rear and east of her property, thence to a second sand box, in a natural ravine, approximately sixty feet further east up the incline. The spring is located approximately sixty feet up the ravine from the second sand box. Spring and surface waters flow down the ravine, through the two sand boxes, into the eight-inch wooden pipe, and then out to Puget Sound.\nThe city maintains another drainage system in the area which drains the surface waters from Sunset avenue into the main line of the Arkansas street sewer at the intersection of Sunset avenue and West Seattle street. From this point, the sewer line extends westward approximately one hundred twenty feet down the steep incline to a point referred to as manhole 155, thence the line veers northwestwardly away from the property in question. The terrain at manhole 155 is such that any water which may escape from the sewer flows down a dry ravine and into the lower sand box. The soil in the area consists of a substratum of blue clay, an overlay of sandy soil, and a top soil composed primarily of leaf mold. The surface growth is underbrush and trees natural to the area.\nThe steepness of the terrain and the soil texture have presented a drainage and slide problem for many years. There were slides in that area in the years 1937, 1941, 1948, and 1950 which necessitated the city\u2019s repairing or replacing the drainage pipes when they were disrupted by the slides.\nThe drainage system subsequently failed on two occasions, January 6 and 22, 1954. On both occasions, the city made substantial repairs.\nOn February 12, 1954, the wooden drain pipe again broke or parted at a point located approximately sixty feet behind the Sigurdson property. Water gushed from the pipe at the break, and Miss Sigurdson notified the city before ten o\u2019clock a. m. The city workmen who answered the call did not stop the flow of water from the breach, and permitted the water to saturate the hillside. At 4:55 a. m., February 13th, the slide occurred which caused extensive damage to the Sigurdson property.\nAn examination of the area at manhole 155, made shortly after the slide by an engineer employed by Miss Sigurdson, showed evidence of erosion or wash below the manhole, which flow was down the ravine to the lower sand box. There was no evidence of erosion or wash above the manhole. The testimony of the foreman for the city\u2019s engineering department corroborated the engineer\u2019s findings.\nLena Sigurdson commenced this action to recover the cost of repairs to her house and lot occasioned by the damage caused by the landslide. Her complaint alleged that the city was negligent in failing to maintain and keep in repair the drainage system, in failing to take reasonable precautions to prevent the saturation of the slope, and in failing to protect her property from damage occasioned by the slide. The city denied liability.\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the sum of twenty-six' hundred dollars. From the judgment entered upon the verdict, the .city has appealed, making seven assignments of error.\nThe first four assignments of error raise the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence to establish liability. Appellant\u2019s principal contention is that, since it did not install the drainage system, it is not responsible for it. Appellant further contends that, even though it did make certain repairs on the Federally-installed drainage system, it is not liable if the repairs proved inadequate or if the repair work was negligently done, for the reason that it had no duty to perform any service to benefit only this privately owned property.\nThe basis of this action is negligence. Negligence, as applied to a municipality in the performance of a corporate or ministerial function, is an unintentional breach of a legal duty, causing damage reasonably foreseeable, without which breach the damage could not occur. Burr v. Clark, 30 Wn. (2d) 149, 190 P. (2d) 769 (1948). To establish negligence under this definition, issues of both law and fact are involved.\nThe legal issues are, (1) was the function a corporate or ministerial function upon which liability may be incurred, as opposed to a governmental function to which the rule of immunity applies, and (2) was there a legal duty on the part of the municipality to perform the act, the nonperformance of which is alleged to have caused the damage?\nThe factual issues are, (1) did the city, in the performance of its duty, if any, exercise ordinary and reasonable care, (2) did the failure to exercise reasonable care constitute a breach or failure of the duty to perform, (3) could the city reasonably foresee that such failure would cause damage or injury to another, and (4) was the failure to perform the duty the proximate cause of the damage?\nWith regard to the first question of law above set out, we have held that a municipality is liable for injuries resulting from negligence in the performance of ministerial and corporate acts relating to the improvement and maintenance of public streets. Bradshaw v. Seattle, 43 Wn. (2d) 766, 264 P. (2d) 265 (1953).\nIt is generally held that a municipality, in maintaining drains and sewers, acts in its corporate and ministerial capacity, and is liable for negligence resulting in injury relating thereto. 18 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d ed.), 489, \u00a7 53.125.\nWe can see no substantial difference between the function of improving and maintaining public streets and that of improving and maintaining drains such as we are concerned with here, and which are necessarily ancillary to the function of maintaining the streets.\nWe therefore conclude that the improvement and maintenance of the drainage system here in question was a corporate and ministerial function.\nThe second question of law is, did the city owe a duty to maintain the drainage system in question?\nThe appellant city contends that there is no such duty, and cites Wiley v. Aberdeen, 123 Wash. 539, 212 Pac. 1049 (1923). The Wiley case determined that the replacement of a culvert on private property was a private rather than a public purpose, and that the city was without jurisdiction to expend public funds to accomplish a private purpose. In the Wiley case, the city had never maintained or repaired the existing culvert. In the case at bar, the city had maintained the drainage system for eighteen years. The area is admittedly a slide area, and, without the drain, it well could constitute a hazard to the public streets. An assistant city engineer, in his testimony, referred to this hazard as a nuisance.\nSunset avenue traverses the crest of the area, and Alki avenue is located at the base of the steep incline. It is clear that the prevention of slides from below Sunset avenue and the prevention of slides onto Alki avenue are necessary to the maintenance of these streets and are, therefore, public purposes.- This drain is a preventive measure against slides. The drain controls and concentrates the flow of water from the area east of Alki avenue into a single pipe which continues beneath the streets to Puget Sound. Had the water been permitted to flow unrestrained down the hillside, the owners of the private property in the comparatively flat area below, in the performance of their common-law right to fend off surface waters, would have forced the water to flow around their properties and onto Alki avenue. Thus the flow would have reached the avenue from several locations, and the city then would have been presented with the problem of draining this water from the street. Being confronted with this problem, the city elected, as it had a right to do, to divert the flow of water from its source into a pipe beneath the street. In either event, the disposal of the drainage water at Alki avenue was a public purpose, and public funds can be expended in the performance of a public purpose.\nHere, the city designated the place where the drain was to be constructed upon the property of another. Thereafter, it assumed the control and management of the system, as is shown by the following testimony of Mr. Fitch, an assistant city engineer:\n\u201cQ. Then, after the W.P.A. pulled out who took charge of the maintenance of this system? A. The function then was to transfer that to the maintenance division of the City Engineer\u2019s office. Q. Very well. A. And they handled it from there on.\u201d\nThat the city \u201chandled it from there on\u201d is shown by the fact that it made extensive repairs to the system in 1937, 1941, 1948, and 1950.\n\u201cMunicipal liability is restricted to the public sewers which the corporation controls; it does not extend to private sewers and drains which it did not construct, nor accept. . . . But if sewers, drains or culverts constructed by third persons are, in some legal manner, adopted by the municipality as a part of its sewerage or drainage system, or the municipality assumes control and management thereof, the municipality becomes liable for injuries resulting therefrom, since in such cases it is immaterial by whom the sewer, drain or culvert was constructed.\u201d (Italics ours.) 18 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d ed.), 467, \u00a7 53.118.\nApplying this rule to the case at bar, we conclude that it is immaterial who constructed the drainage system. The duty of the appellant to repair and maintain it is established by evidence that the city assumed the control and management thereof for a period of approximately eighteen years.\nThe evidence does not indicate what benefit to private property, if any, was effected by the construction of the drain. The concentration of w\u00e1ter into a single stream would create a greater hazard to the private property, upon which the flow was thus concentrated, than would the normal flow. We cannot say that the concentration of this water, by the establishment of the drain, so that it flowed upon the land of respondent was a benefit to her property. In fact, such a concentration would be a greater hazard to her. There was no showing that the establishment of the drain was of any benefit to the King county property upon which the system was constructed.\nSince there was no showing of benefit to private property, and the evidence discloses that the works progress administration constructed the drain and that the city immediately assumed the maintenance of the completed project, both the Federal administration and the municipal authorities, by their acts and conduct, established the project to be solely for a public purpose. If any private benefit resulted, it was incidental to the primary purpose.\nAppellant cites Woodward v. Seattle, 140 Wash. 83, 248 Pac. 73 (1926). In that case, it was held that the action of the municipality was ultra vires. We are concerned here with acts that are within the general powers of the municipality, which acts, being for a public purpose, are not ultra vires. The rule announced in the Woodward case is not applicable.\nWe conclude, therefore, that the city, having adopted the drainage system, incurred a duty to maintain it. The issue of whether the city legally could enter upon King county property for the purpose of maintaining the drain in question is not before us, for the reason that the property owners, being the only parties who could complain, have not done so.\nWas there sufficient evidence to support a finding of negligence?\nThe evidence disclosed that the eight-inch wooden pipe was not sufficient to carry the drainage load; that the wooden pipe broke frequently; that the terrain was steep and precipitous, and particularly so at the point where the February 12th break occurred; that the soil texture was subject to slides when saturated with water; that an unrestrained eight-inch flow of water would saturate the area, and that there had been frequent slides. On February 12th, the city was given notice of the break in the pipe. It responded to the call and knowingly permitted the water to flow at least partially unrestrained. The earth slide which occurred on the morning of February 13th originated directly beneath the break in the pipe.\nThe evidence as to the source of the water which overloaded the eight-inch pipe was conflicting. The testimony of respondent\u2019s expert witness was that the-flow from the spring, approximately five gallons per minute, plus the run-off of precipitation from the eight tenths of an acre, as shown by the rainfall chart, did not produce a sufficient flow to overload the pipe. There was evidence of flow from manhole 155, and that this was the only other source of water available. Hence, there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer that the overload came from manhole 155.\nIt was for the jury to determine, from the evidence, whether these acts constituted negligence, whether the damage was reasonably foreseeable, and whether this negligence was the proximate cause of the slide. Unless this court can say, as a matter of law, that there is neither evidence nor reasonable inference therefrom sufficient to sustain the verdict, it will not be disturbed. James v. Ellis, 44 Wn. (2d) 599, 269 P. (2d) 573 (1954), and case cited.\nThe record establishes that there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict of the jury. We find no merit in appellant\u2019s assignments of error Nos. 1 through 4.\nAssignment of error No. 5 relates to the giving of, and failure to give, certain instructions.\nBy instruction No. 7, the court instructed the jury that there was no duty, under the facts of this case, resting upon the respondent to repair the drain. The objection of appellant to this instruction was that respondent owed a duty to minimize the damage.\nThe respondent had no duty to repair the drainage system. She promptly notified the city of the broken pipe. Her duty was to protect her property against the normal flow of surface waters. Here, the city had collected the surface waters and discharged them in a concentrated and destructive stream, immediately behind her property. It is not this type of flow which property owners must guard against and fend off. See Wood v. Tacoma, 66 Wash. 266, 119 Pac. 859 (1911), and Tope v. King County, 189 Wash. 463, 65 P. (2d) 1283 (1937). Further, there is no evidence in the record that drainage waters came upon respondent\u2019s property and caused damage. It was the earth slide that caused the damage.\nAt the time the exception to this instruction was made, the reason given the trial court was not the reason urged before this court. The exception therefore was insufficient. Gile v. Nielsen, 20 Wn. (2d) 1, 10, 145 P. (2d) 288 (1944).\nInstruction No. 12 deals with the duty of the city, after it had assumed control and management of the drainage system, to maintain and repair it. The giving of this instruction was excepted to upon the same grounds stated in the motion questioning the sufficiency of the evidence. In view of our conclusions expressed herein, the instruction properly stated the law as applied to the facts.\nWith regard to appellant\u2019s proposed instruction No. 8, what we have said concerning instruction No. 12 applies to the refusal of the court to give this instruction. As applied to the facts of this case, it is not a correct statement of the law.\nWe find no error in assignment No. 5.\nAssignment No. 6 relates to a contention that it was error to admit any testimony concerning the city\u2019s alleged negligence in failing to keep the Arkansas sewer system in proper repair, and the inference from that evidence that some of the seepage from that system contributed to the flow that overloaded the wood stave pipe and caused the breach therein.\nAppellant\u2019s first objection was that the Arkansas sewer system was not within the pleadings. Exhibit No. 16 shows that the Arkansas sewer system contains three inlets on Sunset avenue, which drain the street area and empty into the pipe leading directly to manhole 155. There was evidence of seepage and of a defect in the manhole. The Arkansas street sewer is definitely a part of the over-all drainage system, and is within the pleadings, being paragraph No. 5(a) of. the complaint.\nThe second objection is that respondent\u2019s expert opinion evidence was speculative and conjectural. The expert\u2019s testimony was limited to his examination of the area, and, in his opinion, the only source of the water which overburdened the wooden drainage system was seepage from the manhole. The conclusions of the witness were based upon his subjective and objective findings. The testimony was admissible. The weight, if any, to be given such testimony is for the jury to determine.\nFinally, the appellant assigns as error the failure to grant its motion for a new trial. The appellant set out all of the statutory grounds in its motion. In its argument before this court and in the appeal briefs, no specific ground is relied upon.\nWe have examined the record in the light of each of the grounds set out in the motion and find no merit in this assignment of error.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nHamley, C. J., Finley, Weaver, and Rosellini, JJ., concur."

    "Alexander, J.\nWe granted review of a decision of the Court of Appeals in which that court reversed a summary judgment in favor of Patricia DiBlasi and dismissed her suit against the City of Seattle for damage to her real property allegedly caused by the runoff of surface water. The principal issue before us is whether a municipality can be held liable for a landslide caused by surface waters that are collected and channeled on a city street and thrust onto the property of another in a manner different from the natural flow. We hold that a municipality may have liability in such circumstances, and, therefore, we reverse the Court of Appeals. We, however, remand to the trial court to resolve the factual dispute about whether the City\u2019s street did in fact act to collect, channel and thrust surface waters onto DiBlasi\u2019s property in a manner different from the natural flow.\nIn 1924, a real estate developer platted land in West Seattle and dedicated SW Barton Street (Barton), 38th Avenue SW (38th), SW Bernice Place (Bernice), and SW Fletcher Street (Fletcher) to the City of Seattle for public use as roadways. The dedication carried with it the right of the City to make necessary slopes for cuts or fills in the original grading of the streets. The City owns property south of Bernice and west of 38th, commonly called Fauntleroy Park. Bernice, Barton, and 38th have all been developed as streets. Fletcher has not been developed as a street because it lies at the bottom of a ravine.\nDiBlasi\u2019s house, which was built in 1975, is on 38th directly across from Fauntleroy Park. The house, which sits near the edge of the ravine, is 20 to 30 feet lower than Barton. Thus, 38th slopes fairly steeply downhill from Barton. A map on the next page illustrates this area.\nThe City initially opened and paved only the upper 135 feet of 38th and when it did so it did not construct any catch basins, channels, ditches, or artificial drains. In 1975, the developer who built the DiBlasi home graded and graveled an additional portion of 38th, extending the street to the edge of the ravine. The City alleges that the contractor filled a smaller ravine, but the contractor denies having done so.\nSometime after DiBlasi\u2019s contractor graded and graveled the southern portion of 38th, the City built a berm on Barton at the point where that street intersects with 38th. The berm was installed in order to stop surface water from running over onto 38th. Prior to April 1991, the City resurfaced Barton and removed the berm. According to Barbara Jayne, a long-time resident of the area, large amounts of rain water ran down 38th from Barton after the berm was removed. A hydrology expert, Dr. K. Malcolm Leytham, who was retained by DiBlasi \u201cin part to review the City of Seattle\u2019s activities in the area of 38th Avenue S.W from a hydrological standpoint,\u201d estimated that the removal of the berm doubled the amount of water that ran down 38th. Clerk\u2019s Papers (CP) at 257. Barbara Jayne indicated in her declaration that this concerned her because the water \u201cwas eating away and putting crevices down the street.\u201d CP at 262.\nResponding to complaints from citizens about the problem created by the removal of the berm, the City eventually constructed a new berm. This did not, however, prevent water from running down Barton to 38th in times of heavy rain. Surface water runoff from the paved portion of 38th also continued to create gullies on the graveled portion of that street.\nIn early March 1991, the ground at the foot of 38th \u201cset-down\u201d about three feet. CP at 86. This so-called \u201ctension crack,\u201d or \u201cslump,\u201d extended 40 feet east from the edge of Fauntleroy Park across the end of 38th and the DiBlasi property. A landslide expert, E Erik Mikkelsen, inspected the site at this time at DiBlasi\u2019s request and concluded that surface water runoff down 38th street had saturated the fill material on the slope and created the slump. He also feared that additional surface water would flow into the newly-opened crack and cause a landslide. Mikkelsen, acting on DiBlasi\u2019s behalf, contacted the City about the problem and met at the site on two occasions with Herb Allwine of the Seattle Engineering Department to discuss the situation. The City, however, declined to take any action.\nDuring a rainstorm in early April 1991, water pressure in the tension crack caused the slope to give way, taking out a portion of DiBlasi\u2019s property up to the edge of her house. Mikkelsen indicated that if the City had taken action when requested, it could have prevented the slide by inserting horizontal drain pipes to drain the slope, thereby redirecting the surface water. He also opined that the City could have accomplished this work in two days at a cost of $15,000. Mikkelsen concluded that \u201c[w]hat finally triggered the April 4th landslide was, in my opinion, the water concentrated by and flowing off 38th Avenue S.W. into the tension crack.\u201d CP at 89.\nLeytham indicated that \u201c[bjecause of the location of 38th Avenue S.W., surface waters have been concentrated, collected and thrust onto adjoining lands in quantities greater than, and different from, the natural regime.\u201d CP at 134. But for the presence of the street, according to Leytham, the surface water would have percolated into the ground and not over the sides of the ravine. In explaining the factors that contributed to the slide, he stated:\n[I]t is self-evident that the location of 38th Avenue S.W. resulted in storm runoff being discharged into the area of the slump at the foot of 38th Avenue S.W. The volume of water is a function not only of the amount of rainfall but of the contributing surface area of both 38th Avenue S.W and S.W. Barton Street, and the impermeable nature of the street surfaces.\nCP at 895.\nDiBlasi brought suit against the City on an array of theories, including a claim that the City failed to maintain its prescriptive easement for surface water flows running down 38th and that it allowed 38th to concentrate, collect and thrust waters onto her property in \u201cquantities greater than, and in a manner different from, the natural regime.\u201d CP at 137. DiBlasi also asserted that the City\u2019s negligent failure to maintain its street caused the landslide, created a nuisance, and constituted a taking and trespass. The City denied liability and claimed affirmative defenses of contributory negligence, prescriptive easement and contribution. It also alleged that liability should be apportioned to the developer who allegedly filled in the smaller ravine.\nDiBlasi and the City each moved for summary judgment. DiBlasi submitted the declarations of Mikkelsen and Leytham in support of her motion. The City relied on its expert, John Peterson, who disagreed with the conclusions reached by DiBlasi\u2019s experts. Peterson stated that \u201c[a]ny surface waters which reached the slide area, the side of the slope, or the DiBlasi property by way of the street right-of-way were simply those which naturally flowed therefrom, and there was no artificial collection or concentration of surface waters onto or down the right-of-way.\u201d CP at 269. The trial court, apparently relying on the declarations of DiBlasi\u2019s experts, entered summary judgment in favor of DiBlasi on all of her claims except for inverse condemnation.\nThe Court of Appeals reversed and dismissed DiBlasi\u2019s suit, concluding that any damage caused by surface waters that would have percolated into the ground, but for the impermeable surface of the roads, cannot, as a matter of law, give rise to municipal liability. DiBlasi v. City of Seattle, 85 Wn. App. 514, 522, 933 P.2d 443, review granted, 133 Wn.2d 1002, 943 P.2d 663 (1997). It also held that the City could not be held liable for failing to maintain a prescriptive easement because the City did not thrust water onto her property, and that DiBlasi could not prevail on her theory that the City failed to maintain the roadway because such a duty extends only to travelers along the roadway. Finally, the Court of Appeals upheld the trial court\u2019s dismissal of DiBlasi\u2019s inverse condemnation claim, concluding that she failed to establish that the City\u2019s actions had caused her injury. DiBlasi\u2019s petition for review to this court followed.\nI. Standard of Review\nWe may affirm an order granting summary judgment only if we are satisfied, after considering the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, that \u201cthere is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Barnes v. McLendon, 128 Wn.2d 563, 569, 910 P.2d 469 (1996) (citing In re Estates of Hibbard, 118 Wn.2d 737, 744, 826 P.2d 690 (1992)). All questions of law are reviewed de novo. Mountain Park Homeowners Ass\u2019n v. Tydings, 125 Wn.2d 337, 341, 883 P.2d 1383 (1994) (citing Syrovy v. Alpine Resources, Inc., 122 Wn.2d 544, 548 n.3, 859 P.2d 51 (1993)).\nII. Can a City Be Held Liable for Damages Caused by Surface Water That Is Collected and Channeled Off of a City Street and Thrust onto the Froperty of Another?\nThe City has asserted that the trial court erred in not granting summary judgment in its favor on the basis that a City cannot, as a matter of law, be held liable for damages caused by surface water that is collected on its streets and channeled onto the property of another. The Court of Appeals agreed with this proposition and reversed the summary judgment order the trial court granted to DiBlasi and dismissed her suit against the City. In doing so it cited Wood v. City of Tacoma, 66 Wash. 266, 271, 119 P. 859 (1911), for the principle that municipalities are not liable for injury to property \u201coccasioned by the original grading of streets.\u201d DiBlasi, 85 Wn. App. at 518. The Court of Appeals went on to observe that the rights and liabilities of a municipality as to surface water are identical to those of private landowners, and that because surface water is a \u201ccommon enemy\u201d the municipality may defend itself against it\u2014even to the consequent injury of others. DiBlasi, 85 Wn. App. at 518.\nThe Court of Appeals\u2019 assessment of the rule from Wood fails to take into account some additional language from that opinion that is highly relevant here:\nThere is an exception to this rule of nonliability, which, though not indorsed by some of the courts, and which we do not find has often been applied to the initial grading of streets, we nevertheless believe to be sound in any case. A city may not gather up surface water and discharge it upon land in a concentrated volume . . . without liability, whether the water be such as naturally would have flowed onto the land or not.\nWood, 66 Wash. at 272-73.\nThe Court of Appeals did, however, recognize a later case where we stated that a municipality can be liable if \u201cin the course of an authorized construction, it collects surface water by an artificial channel or in large quantities and pours it, in a body, upon the land of a private person, to his injury.\u201d Wilber Dev. Corp. v. Les Rowland Constr., Inc., 83 Wn.2d 871, 874, 523 P.2d 186 (1974).\nWe went on to say:\n[W]hile municipal authorities may pave and grade streets and are not ordinarily liable for an increase in surface water naturally falling on the land of a private owner where the work is properly done, they are not permitted to concentrate and gather such water into artificial drains or channels and throw it on the land of an individual owner in such manner and volume as to cause substantial injury to such land and without making adequate provision for its proper outflow, unless compensation is made.\nWilber, 83 Wn.2d at 874-75 (emphasis added) (citing 18 Eugene McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \u00a7 53.144, at 538 (James Perkowitz-Solheim et al. eds., 3d ed. rev. vol. 1963)). A rule as arguably inconsistent as the one in Wilber requires, to be sure, some close reading in its interpretation. Suffice it to say, however, that in reading this language from Wilber, in conjunction with what we wrote in Wood, one cannot substitute the words \u201cnever liable\u201d for \u201cnot ordinarily liable.\u201d The Court of Appeals, though, concluded that the City could not have liability for the slide because the mere improvement of a public street can never constitute artificial collection, concentration, or channeling of water under the common enemy doctrine of water law. According to that court, the declarations of DiBlasi\u2019s expert failed to establish anything more than a normal increase in the flow of water attributable to location and construction of nonpermeable roadways.\nIn reaching its determination, the Court of Appeals relied to an extent on the common enemy doctrine. That rule provides that surface water is \u201can outlaw and a common enemy against which anyone may defend himself, even though by so doing injury may result to others.\u201d Cass v. Dicks, 14 Wash. 75, 78, 44 P. 113 (1896). It concluded that the City could not be liable for water runoff caused by simply paving the ground\u2019s surface, and that DiBlasi could not complain about the street\u2019s location because it was located where the grantor (her predecessor-in-interest) had dedicated it. The Court of Appeals likewise held that removal of the berm on Barton street did not give rise to \u201cliability for artificial concentration and discharge\u201d because the City had no duty to construct the berm in the first place, and there was no evidence as to when the City removed the berm. DiBlasi, 85 Wn. App. at 523.\nDiBlasi contends that the Court of Appeals misapplied the common enemy doctrine in the instant case. She asserts that this rule only shields landowners from liability when they take a positive action to protect their property from surface water damage. She contends that because the City took no affirmative steps to protect its streets from the surface water, the rule does not apply. By failing to recognize this distinction, she concludes, the court turned the common enemy \u201cshield\u201d into a \u201csword\u201d that the City could use to both avoid its obligations to remedy a hazardous condition and to impose the duty to repair the street on a private citizen.\nDiBlasi also contends that the common enemy doctrine only protects a landowner who acts reasonably to defend against surface waters. We have written as much before. See Morris v. McNicol, 83 Wn.2d 491, 495, 519 P.2d 7 (1974) (\u201c[T]his doctrine applies only if the upland landowner\u2019s use is reasonable.\u201d (Citation omitted.)) She argues that the City acted unreasonably by refusing to do anything about the problem once the fissure opened up \u201ceven though . . . lives and property were threatened and even though the City could have remedied the problem in a short period of time and for a small amount of money.\u201d Pet. for Review at 12.\nDiBlasi\u2019s argument regarding the common enemy doctrine is persuasive. However, as this court made clear in Wood, the rule limiting municipal liability for storm water runoff is not based solely on the common enemy doctrine. Rather, it is also based on the principle that a city does not have to pay landowners for consequential damages to their property from the original grading of streets and alleys as long as the city does not gather up surface water and discharge it upon adjoining land in a concentrated volume.\nIn support of her assertion that the City can have liability here, DiBlasi relies on a decision from Division Three of the Court of Appeals wherein that court held that Douglas County had liability for damages caused by water runoff from a county road which acted as a channel to collect and divert water from its natural course. See Burton v. Douglas County, 14 Wn. App. 151, 154-55, 539 P.2d 97, review denied, 86 Wn.2d 1007 (1975). The road at issue in Burton was in a watershed and \u201cacted as an artificial drain because the water draining from the east to the west, in the absence of the crown in the road, would have continued to run across the road instead of being channeled by it.\u201d Burton, 14 Wn. App. at 154. Liability resulted for damages caused to an adjacent property owner\u2019s home because \u201cDouglas County\u2019s road acted as a channel to collect and divert water from its natural course and ultimately discharge surface water upon Burton\u2019s property to his injury.\u201d Burton, 14 Wn. App. at 155 (footnote omitted).\nThe Court of Appeals in this case acknowledged that Burton supports DiBlasi\u2019s claim, but declined to follow the decision because it could not \u201cmeaningfully reconcile its holding with Wood\u201d DiBlasi, 85 Wn. App. at 520. It stated that under its reading of Wood, a municipality does not incur liability for constructing a road upon a dedicated street plat, even though it changes the surface and increases the surface water runoff onto adjacent property. Because Burton \u201crelied upon the existence and original grading of the road, rather than the gathering of water into an artificial drain or channel,\u201d the court concluded that \u201cit misstates the law.\u201d DiBlasi, 85 Wn. App. at 520.\nDiBlasi also relies on a decision from Division Two of the Court of Appeals wherein that court favorably cited Burton in finding a constitutional taking where Pierce County\u2019s construction of both a road and a drainage culvert \u201ccaused the collection of surface water from twelve acres of land and artificially channeled it down the slope, through the culvert, and onto the [plaintiffs\u2019] property.\u201d Hoover v. Pierce County, 79 Wn. App. 427, 432, 903 P.2d 464 (1995), review denied, 129 Wn.2d 1007, 917 P.2d 129 (1996). However, because the initial taking (i.e., damage to the plaintiffs\u2019 property) predated the plaintiffs\u2019 purchase of the impacted property, either when the road was constructed or when the culvert was subsequently added, the court found that the County escaped liability because \u201ca new taking cause of action requires additional governmental action\u201d and the County had not undertaken any new action since it installed the roadway culvert. Hoover, 79 Wn. App. at 436.\nDiBlasi argues that the similarities between the instant case and Burton and Hoover warrant a reversal of Division One\u2019s decision. As in Burton and Hoover, experts here testified that a city street diverted surface water from its natural flow and acted to channel it onto DiBlasi\u2019s property to her injury. Cf. CP at 134; Hoover, 79 Wn. App. at 429; Burton, 14 Wn. App. at 155. Therefore, according to DiBlasi, the City should be held liable.\nThe City contends, on the other hand, that Division One\u2019s decision in the instant case was correct and consistent with Wood and the cases that followed it. The City asserts that the Burton case is \u201can aberration\u201d that is inconsistent with Washington law. Answer of Resp\u2019t at 14. It argues that Hoover is distinguishable from the present case because both the road and culvert in that case acted to artificially collect and divert surface waters that were outside the natural watershed. The City\u2019s argument does not acknowledge that the Hoover court found that it was the concentration and channeling of water by the street, at least in part, that gave rise to a constitutional taking.\nThe City relies on Gaines v. Pierce County, 66 Wn. App. 715, 834 P.2d 631 (1992), review denied, 120 Wn.2d 1021, 844 P.2d 1017 (1993), arguing that Division Two of the Court of Appeals held \u201cthat drainage from increased surface water flow from the construction of impervious surfaces including the widening of a highway was not compensible [sic].\u201d Answer of Resp\u2019t at 10. This is a misstatement of the holding. Moreover, this case is not directly on point. The plaintiffs in Gaines had sued for flooding damage to their property that they alleged was caused by water artificially channeled in ditches constructed along State Route 161, as opposed to the road itself, among other causes. However, the court noted that the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cproperty lies at the low point of the drainage basin; all surface water in the basin ultimately flows to it; and . . . neighbors, by engaging in extensive diking and drainage on their properties, caused increased surface water to be"

    "Dolliver, J.\nThe Nisqually River is one of 10 major river systems in the Puget Sound area. The Nisqually River basin encompasses a drainage area of approximately 712 square miles in Pierce, Thurston, and Lewis Counties. The eastern portion of the basin is rugged and irregular and reaches an elevation of 14,408 feet at the summit of Mount Rainier. From the town of LaGrande west to Puget Sound, the basin is generally below 1,000 feet elevation and is characterized by rolling foothills broken by occasional gravelly prairies and shallow lakes. Most of the basin is heavily forested.\nThe Nisqually River floodplain covers approximately 9,000 acres. The narrow floodplain above Alder Reservoir suffers frequent flooding. The steep gradient of the river results in high velocity flows that carry large quantities of gravel, logs, and other debris. During high flows, heavy deposits of bed load and debris fill the channel and force the river to spread over the valley floor. See generally Puget Sound Task Force \u2014 Pacific Northwest River Basins Comm'n, Comprehensive Study of Water and Related Land Resources, Puget Sound and Adjacent Waters, app. 12, at 2-1, 10-1 through 10-17 (1970).\nIn 1961 Pierce County constructed a dike 3,300 feet long on the north side of the Nisqually River just outside the border of Mount Rainier National Park. The dike was extended by the County in 1968 and 1971. The County has continued to maintain the dike, inspecting it periodically and, when necessary, adding rock and riprap to its face.\nPlaintiffs are Pierce County residents who own cabins behind the Nisqually River dike in a subdivision known as Nisqually Park. Nisqually Park was platted on property homesteaded by the parents of Margaret Fullinwider and E. Stanley Hall. Plaintiffs purchased the lots on which their cabins were built from defendants Melvin, Hall, and Ful-linwider, doing business as Recreation Properties (hereinafter defendants Melvin, Hall, and Fullinwider will be referred to collectively as Recreation Properties).\nOn December 2, 1977, due to flooding caused by record rainfall and the melting of the Nisqually Glacier on Mount Rainier, a portion of the Nisqually River dike was breached by the river. The floodwaters caused extensive damage to plaintiffs' cabins along the river.\nOn June 9, 1978, plaintiffs filed this action against Pierce County and against Recreation Properties. Plaintiffs' motion to certify as a class action was denied and defendants' motion to dismiss suit as a class action was granted. The Pierce County Superior Court bifurcated the issues of liability and damages for trial.\nA jury trial on the issue of liability began on November 7, 1979, and concluded on December 27, 1979. At the conclusion of plaintiffs' case the trial court dismissed the action against defendant Recreation Properties. The jury found for the plaintiffs against Pierce County, and the Superior Court entered a judgment on January 18, 1980. Subsequently, a jury trial was held on the issue of damages; the judgment was entered on October 17, 1980.\nDefendant Pierce County seeks review of judgments rendered against it in a Pierce County Superior Court trial bifurcated on the issues of liability and damages. Division Two of the Court of Appeals certified the case to the Supreme Court for direct review. See RCW 2.06.030(d). We accepted certification to consider the following question:\nWhether RCW 86.12.037, which grants statutory immunity to counties for noncontractual acts and omissions relating to flood protection, was impliedly repealed by RCW 4.92.090 and by RCW 4.96.010, which abrogate common law statutory immunity.\nWe hold RCW 86.12.037 was not impliedly repealed by RCW 4.92.090 and 4.96.010. Furthermore, we hold RCW 86.12.037 does not violate the equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. 14 and Const. art. 1, \u00a7 12. We reverse the trial court's rulings and vacate the judgments rendered against defendant Pierce County.\nRCW 86.12.020 authorizes counties to construct and maintain dikes, levees, and other improvements to protect against floods. RCW 86.12.037 declares:\nNo action shall be brought. . . against any county . . . for any noncontractual acts or omissions . . . relating to the improvement, protection, regulation and control for flood prevention and navigation purposes of any river or its tributaries and the beds, banks and waters thereof\nRCW 86.12.037 was enacted by the Legislature in 1921 to shield counties from liability for their efforts to protect the public from flood damage. See Short v. Pierce Cy., 194 Wash. 421, 430-31, 78 P.2d 610 (1938). RCW 86.12.037 provides immunity to counties even where their negligence in the construction and maintenance of flood control devices results in damage to private property during floods or other periods of high water. Short, 194 Wash. at 431.\nWhile it is clear there has been no explicit repeal, plaintiffs contend RCW 86.12.037 was impliedly repealed by RCW 4.92.090 and RCW 4.96.010. RCW 4.92.090 reads as follows:\nThe state of Washington, whether acting in its governmental or proprietary capacity, shall be liable for damages arising out of its tortious conduct to the same extent as if it were a private person or corporation.\nRCW 4.92.090 applies to political subdivisions of the State, whose sovereign immunity is derived from the State's sovereign immunity. Kelso v. Tacoma, 63 Wn.2d 913, 916, 390 P.2d 2 (1964). Likewise, RCW 4.96.010 declares:\nAll political subdivisions, municipal corporations, and quasi municipal corporations of the state, whether acting in a governmental or proprietary capacity, shall be liable for damages arising out of their tortious conduct ... to the same extent as if they were a private person or corporation . . .\nImplied repeals of statutes are disfavored by Washington courts. E.g., U.S. Oil & Ref. Co. v. Department of Ecology, 96 Wn.2d 85, 88, 633 P.2d 1329 (1981); Jenkins v. State, 85 W.n.2d 883, 886, 540 P.2d 1363 (1975); Tardiff v. Shoreline Sch. Dist., 68 Wn.2d 164, 166, 411 P.2d 889 (1966). Ordinarily, a general statute does not repeal an earlier special statute by implication. U.S. Oil & Ref. Co. v. Department of Ecology, supra; Herrett Trucking Co. v. Washington Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 58 Wn.2d 542, 543, 364 P.2d 505 (1961). An implied repeal will only be found where:\n(1) the later act covers the entire subject matter of the earlier legislation, is complete in itself, and is evidently intended to supersede prior legislation on the subject; or\n(2) the two acts are so clearly inconsistent with, and repugnant to, each other that they cannot be reconciled and both given effect by a fair and reasonable construction.\nIn re Chi-Dooh Li, 79 Wn.2d 561, 563, 488 P.2d 259 (1971), quoted in U.S. Oil & Ref. Co. v. Department of Ecology, supra at 88.\nWhen determining the intent of a legislative enactment, the meaning of a plain and unambiguous statute must be derived from the wording of the statute itself. In re Lehman, 93 Wn.2d 25, 27, 604 P.2d 948 (1980); Garrison v. State Nursing Bd., 87 Wn.2d 195, 550 P.2d 7 (1976). Where a statute is ambiguous, however, or where the language is unclear, we may resort to extrinsic aids such as legislative history to discern legislative intent. State v. Grays Harbor Cy., 98 Wn.2d 606, 607, 656 P.2d 1084 (1983); Whitehead v. Department of Social & Health Servs., 92 Wn.2d 265, 268, 595 P.2d 926 (1979). We believe there has been no implied repeal of RCW 86.12.037 under the test in In re Chi-Dooh Li, supra. Even assuming, however, there is some statutory ambiguity, we believe the lack of legislative intent to repeal RCW 86.12.037 is confirmed by examination of the legislative history of the statutes.\nIn 1961 the common law doctrine of sovereign immunity was abrogated by the Legislature. Laws of 1961, ch. 136, \u00a7 1, p. 1680; RCW 4.92.090. In 1964, in Kelso v. Tacoma, supra, we held RCW 4.92.090 applies to all political subdivisions of the State. See Kelso, 63 Wn.2d at 916-17. On a subsequent occasion, however, the court ruled RCW 4.92.090 did not impliedly repeal specific statutory limitations on the liability of a subdivision of the State for tortious conduct. E.g., Tardiff v. Shoreline Sch. Dist., 68 Wn.2d 164, 167, 411 P.2d 889 (1966).\nAs a response, the Legislature in 1967 explicitly abrogated the doctrine of sovereign immunity as it relates to political subdivisions of the State. Laws of 1967, ch. 164, \u00a7 1, p. 792, codified in RCW 4.96.010. Moreover, the Legislature repealed former RCW 28.58.030, successfully asserted by defendant in Tardiff as the basis for its sovereign immunity. Laws of 1967, ch. 164, \u00a7 16, p. 804. See Tardiff, 68 Wn.2d at 167, 169. Even so, soon after passage of Laws of 1967, ch. 164, \u00a7 1, p. 792, we again ruled RCW 4.92.090 did not repeal a specific statutory immunity. Chappel v. Franklin Pierce Sch. Dist. 402, 71 Wn.2d 17, 21, 426 P.2d 471 (1967).\nIn the present case, in light of Chappel and Tardiff and legislative history, the Superior Court incorrectly determined RCW 86.12.037 was impliedly repealed by RCW 4.92.090. RCW 4.96.010 provides even less support for plaintiffs' argument and the Superior Court decision. Laws of 1967, ch. 164, \u00a7 16, p. 804 contained a list of statutes repealed by the measure. While implied repeals of statutes are disfavored by Washington courts, the disinclination to repeal by implication is especially acute when, as here, a later act contains a schedule of statutes repealed and the schedule does not include the statute under consideration. Washington State Welfare Rights Org. v. State, 82 Wn.2d 437, 439, 511 P.2d 990 (1973). Accord, State ex rel. Spokane v. DeGraff, 143 Wash. 326, 331, 255 P. 371 (1927) (principle of implied repeal inapplicable where an act contains schedule of acts repealed). See 1A C. Sands, Statutory Construction \u00a7 23.11 (4th ed. 1972). We hold RCW 86.12.037 was not impliedly repealed by RCW 4.92.090 or RCW 4.96.010.\nIn claiming an equal protection violation, plaintiffs note that in Sado v. Spokane, 22 Wn. App. 298, 588 P.2d 1231 (1979) the Court of Appeals held the City of Spokane liable under RCW 4.96.010 for its negligence in the construction and maintenance of a flood control embankment. Plaintiffs argue that, assuming the court finds that RCW 86.12.037 was not repealed by RCW 4.92.090 or RCW 4.96.010, the grant of sovereign immunity for counties but not for municipal corporations violates the equal protection clauses of the Washington and United States Constitutions.\nAs authority for this proposition, plaintiffs cite Flax v. Kansas Turnpike Auth., 226 Kan. 1, 596 P.2d 446 (1979). In Flax the Kansas Supreme Court ruled the governmental immunity statute disallowing tort actions against the Kansas Turnpike Authority violated the equal protection clause since cities and counties in the state did not enjoy the same immunity. Flax, 226 Kan. at 7-8.\nAt the outset of any equal protection analysis, we must identify the appropriate standard of judicial scrutiny. If a statute creates an inherently suspect classification such as one based on race, nationality, or alienage, the statute, when challenged, will be subjected to strict scrutiny. Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 29 L. Ed. 2d 534, 91 S. Ct. 1848 (1971); Nielsen v. Washington State Bar Ass'n, 90 Wn.2d 818, 820, 585 P.2d 1191 (1978). A statute which does not affect fundamental rights or create a suspect classification, however, is generally subjected to minimal judicial scrutiny and will not be invalidated unless it rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of a legitimate state objective. McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 425-26, 6 L. Ed. 2d 393, 81 S. Ct. 1101 (1961); Nielsen v. Washington State Bar Ass'n, supra.\nCertainly the classification of persons barred from recovery under RCW 86.12.037 is not based on race, nationality, alienage, or any other inherently suspect classification. Likewise, RCW 86.12.037 does not affect fundamental rights. The statute does not prohibit recovery under U.S. Const. amends. 5 or 14 or Const. art. 1, \u00a7 16 where a person's property is taken for a public purpose by a county in the exercise of its police powers. Short v. Pierce Cy., 194 Wash. 421, 435-36, 78 P.2d 610 (1938). See Conger v. Pierce Cy., 116 Wash. 27, 35, 198 P. 377, 18 A.L.R. 393 (1921). Federal courts consistently have held the federal constitution does not imply a right of action for damages against the government. E.g., Duarte v. United States, 532 F.2d 850, 852 (2d Cir. 1976); Boyce v. United States, 523 F. Supp. 1012, 1016 (E.D.N.Y. 1981).\nGiven the foregoing analysis, RCW 86.12.037 need only meet the minimum scrutiny test to pass constitutional muster. Under the minimum scrutiny approach, the reviewing court must determine (1) whether the legislation applies alike to all members within the designated class; (2) whether there are reasonable grounds to distinguish between those within and those without the class; and (3) whether the classification has a rational relationship to the purpose of the legislation. Yakima Cy. Deputy Sheriff's Ass'n v. Board of Comm'rs, 92 Wn.2d 831, 835-36, 601 P.2d 936 (1979). Under the minimum scrutiny analysis, a challenged statute is presumed constitutional and the party challenging it has a heavy burden of showing there is no reasonable basis for the classification or that the classification is contrary to the purpose of the legislation. Deputy Sheriff's Ass'n, 92 Wn.2d at 836.\nIn the present case, we conclude the burden of showing the unconstitutionality of RCW 86.12.037 has not been met. The statute implicitly creates a class of landowners whose property might be damaged as a result of a county's flood control activities. RCW 86.12.037 precludes recovery by all those within the designated class.\nFurthermore, there exist reasonable grounds to distinguish between counties and other political subdivisions of the State (i.e., cities and towns). In Aubertin v. Board of Cy. Comm'rs, 588 F.2d 781 (10th Cir. 1978), the federal court explained the reasons for granting immunity to a county from liability for negligent maintenance of public works while denying a municipality the same immunity:\n[T]he maintenance of city streets, which are in a relatively confined area, is different from the maintenance of county roads, which sprawl all over the countryside- The difficulties which may be encountered in discovering and correcting defects in the latter could rationally have been expected to be greater than those which might be encountered in the former.\nAubertin, 588 F.2d at 785.\nSimilarly, the difficulties inherent in constructing and maintaining flood control measures are greater for counties in Washington than for municipalities. For example, there are approximately 54 miles of riverbed in the 100-year floodplain areas of the Nisqually and Puyallup Rivers in Pierce County. In contrast, less than 1 mile of riverbed exists within a 100-year floodplain in an incorporated area in Pierce County. See Puget Sound Task Force \u2014 Pacific Northwest River Basins Comm'n, Comprehensive Study of Water and Related Land Resources, Puget Sound and Adjacent Waters, app. 12, at 9-2, 10-2 (1970).\nFinally, there exists a rational relationship between the classification created by RCW 86.12.037 and the purpose of the statute. As previously stated, RCW 86.12.037 was enacted to encourage counties to engage in flood control activities. See Short v. Pierce Cy., supra. Shielding counties from liability for undertaking flood control activities prevents the costs of flood damages which will inevitably recur from being added to the cost of constructing the facilities. See National Mfg. Co. v. United States, 210 F.2d 263, 270 (8th Cir. 1954).\nBoth plaintiffs and defendant raise a number of other issues on appeal and cross appeal. Since we rule that RCW 86.12.037 precludes recovery from the County, except for one matter these issues need not be reached. The issue which must be considered is whether the members of Recreation Properties were joint venturers with Pierce County in the location and construction of the dike. We agree with the trial court there was no joint venture and its dismissal of Recreation Properties on the basis of lack of evidence is upheld.\nThe essential elements of a joint venture are (1) a contract, express or implied; (2) a common purpose; (3) a community of interest; (4) an equal right to a voice, accompanied by an equal right to control. Carboneau v. Peterson, 1 Wn.2d 347, 374, 95 P.2d 1043 (1939); Gleason v. Metropolitan Mortgage Co., 15 Wn. App. 481, 493, 551 P.2d 147 (1976). An ownership or proprietary interest in the subject matter of the enterprise by all parties is not essential to creation of a joint venture. Gleason v. Metropolitan Mortgage Co., supra.\nAs stated by the trial court:\nI think the claim against [Recreation Properties] on the basis of joint venture has to fail on the basis that there is no showing that the defendants had any control. I think it is quite clear that the County exercised exclusive control over the design, installation, maintenance, everything to do with the dike and the revetment.\n25 Report of Proceedings, at 44. We have examined the evidence relied upon by plaintiffs to establish the joint venture and agree with the position of the trial court that Recreation Properties had no control over the diking enterprise of Pierce County.\nReversed.\nWilliams, C.J., Stafford, Utter, Brachtenbach, Dore, and Dimmick, JJ., and Bever and Soderland, JJ.

    "Schwellenbach, J.\nThis is an appeal from a judgment entered upon a verdict of a jury, in favor of respondents, for damages as the result of injuries sustained by respondent Betty Jean Schedler when she slipped and fell on an icy sidewalk.\nThe Wagners are owners of a four-apartment building located on the corner of East Mission and Lidgerwood in Spokane. There are two apartments downstairs and two upstairs. The building faces north on Mission. At the front is a door, porch, steps, and sidewalk leading to the street, all used in common by the tenants. At the time in question the Schedlers were leasing, by an oral month to month lease, the lower east apartment. At the rear of their apartment was a door, porch, steps, and walk leading to Lidgerwood street. At the foot of the steps was a short walk (of flat slabs of concrete) which went to the right and obliquely to the rear, where it connected with a driveway to the garage. These facilities were used exclusively by the Schedlers and were not used in common with the other tenants.\nLate in the afternoon of January 6, 1949, Betty Schedler returned home from her work at the North Division Branch of the Old National Bank. Before removing her coat and galoshes she took out the garbage. She went out of the door, onto the porch, down the steps, onto the walk leading to Lidgerwood, then obliquely to the right rear until she got to the driveway; then along the driveway to the garbage can, which was located at the side of the garage. She returned by the same route. Just as she turned from the oblique walk to go onto the porch she slipped on the ice and fell, striking her nose on the lower step. She testified that the steps and walk were \u201cvery, very icy.\u201d\nThe testimony showed that Mr. Wagner cleaned the snow off of all the steps and walks around the house, including these steps and walks used exclusively by the Schedlers. Wagner testified that he did this from the beginning of the winter until the last snowfall; that bie cleaned them after each snow whenever they needed cleaning; that he never saw anyone else clean them; that it would thaw and freeze, and that he looked after it to the best of his ability. Mrs. Schedler testified that all that winter neither she nor her husband cleaned the snow or ice from the steps or walks or any part adjacent to the house; that it was a regular pattern for the Wagners to do this work after each snowfall.\nAt the trial, the court instructed the jury that, ordinarily, a landlord is under no obligation to his tenants to remove or otherwise dispose of snow and ice which naturally accumulates upon leased premises; that where, however, a landlord has assumed the duty to remove snow and ice, he is then under a duty to remove such snow and ice if an accumulation of this nature renders the premises unsafe. He placed the responsibility upon the plaintiffs to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the assumption of such duty by the landlords, their failure to use ordinary care in such performance, and that as a proximate result of such failure Mrs. Schedler was injured to her damage. The jury found for the plaintiffs and judgment was entered accordingly. This appeal follows.\nThe assignments of error are:' (1) the court erred in submitting the case to the jury; (2) the court erred in refusing to grant defendants\u2019 motion for judgment n.o.v.; (3) the court erred in giving an instruction with reference to the landlord\u2019s assuming the duty of cleaning the sidewalks.\nWhenever the owner of a house demises a portion of it to which access is had by way of halls, stairways, porches, walks, or other approaches to be used in common with the owner or tenants of other portions of the same premises, the owner, by such transaction, retains as to the tenant the possession and control of the undemised facilities and it is his duty to keep them, or to use reasonabl\u00e9 care to keep them, in safe condition for the use of the tenant in the enjoyment of his own possession. Oerter v. Ziegler, 59 Wash. 421, 109 Pac. 1058. Roman v. King, 289 Mo. 641, 233 S. W. 161, 25 A. L. R. 1263. Under the majority rule the tenant is a licensee of such undemised facilities. 32 Am. Jur. 561, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 688.\nOrdinarily, the landlord of premises leased to different tenants, who use in common the approaches thereto, is not liable for accumulations of snow and ice due to natural causes, and hence is not liable for injuries to persons using these portions of the premises, due to accumulations of this character. Oerter v. Ziegler, supra; Woods v. Naumkeag Steam Cotton Co., 134 Mass. 357, 45 Am. Rep. 344.\nWhere, however, the landlord has obligated himself to remove the snow and ice from facilities used in common, or has assumed this duty, he must remove the snow and ice if an accumulation of this nature renders the premises unsafe, and for his negligent failure so to do he will be liable to a person thereby injured while making a proper use of this portion of the leased premises, the injured person being a tenant. Annotation, 25 A. L. R. 1302; Massor v. Yates, 137 Ore. 569, 3 P. (2d) 784.\nWhen premises are leased, a stairway, porch, or walk necessary to be used with the premises, and which it is intended shall be for the exclusive use of the tenant, passes as an appurtenant to the leased premises, unless, at the time of entering into the lease, the landlord expressly or impliedly reserves control over such facilities. Andrews v. McCutcheon, 17 Wn. (2d) 340, 135 P. (2d) 459.\nIt will thus be seen that the reason the landlord has the duty to keep the facilities used in common with other tenants in safe condition for the use of the tenants is that, as to such facilities, they are not a part of the estate demised to the various tenants. They are a part of the estate reserved by the landlord for the use and benefit of all the tenants. As to such facilities, the landlord is not liable for accumulations of snow and ice due to natural causes. However, when the landlord assumes the duty of cleaning such facilities of snow and ice, he thereby removes the cloak which exempts him from so doing where the accumulation is due to natural causes, and then becomes liable to the tenants for his negligence in so doing. The cloak of exemption having been removed, he is liable because, in the original lease, he did not devise these particular facilities to the various tenants, but reserved that part of the estate to himself. It is because of the relationship of landlord and tenant and because of the duties imposed upon him by law as a result of such relationship that he is liable.\nAs to facilities which are to be for the. exclusive use of the tenants and thereby pass as an appurtenant to the leased premises, when the landlord assumes to clear such facilities of snow and ice accumulated due to natural causes, he does so gratuitously as a volunteer. By so doing, he does not remove a cloak which would exempt him from liability to the tenant for his negligence. He has not reserved that part of the estate to himself. There is no duty which could attach or revert to him because of the relationship of landlord and tenant. A mere volunteer incurs no obligation because of a gratuitous performance, unless his failure to remedy a dangerous condition is the result of gross negligence. Bell v. Siegel, 242 Mass. 380, 136 N. E. 109, 25 A. L. R. 1261.\nHere, the appellants leased the apartment in question to respondents. Appurtenant thereto, and for the exclusive use of respondents, were the porch, stairs, and walks upon which respondent wife slipped and fell. None of these facilities were reserved by appellants as a part of their es-state. When appellant husband undertook to clean these exclusively demised premises of snow and ice he was under no legal duty to do so. He did so gratuitously as a volunteer. The trial court erred in denying appellants\u2019 motion for judgment n. o. v. We do not find it necessary to discuss the other assignments of error.\nThe judgment is reversed.\nHill, Grady, and Donworth, JJ., concur.\nBeals, J., concurs in the result."

    "Williams, J.\nThis appeal arises out of a suit to enjoin further construction of an apartment building which would extend out over the surface of Bitter Lake in Seattle, and to compel removal of the existing structure.\nBitter Lake is a nonnavigable, natural body of water about 19 acres in area, situated in the north section of the city of Seattle. It is unmeandered, which means that in the original federal government survey the surveyors did not locate the shoreline, but merely ran the government section lines across the lake. As a result many shoreline property owners also own subdivided portions of the lake bed. The lake is surrounded principally by single residences, together with a few multiple residences, a public school ground, and a small city park. Residents of the area have long used the entire lake surface for recreational activities.\nThe plaintiffs are 24 property owners who own upland abutting the lake and, in some instances, parts of the lake bed, or who otherwise have access rights to the lake by reason of an easement to the lake shore. Defendants own a parcel of land abutting on the east side of the lake at the south end, about two-thirds of which is upland and one-third lake bed. Title is traced to an 1872 federal government patent, which made no reference to the lake.\nThe south end of the lake, including defendants\u2019 property, has been business zoned for many years, and was formerly operated as Playland Amusement Park. The property is currently zoned commercial general (CG) by the city of Seattle. In zoning the land around the lake the city ran its zoning lines across the lake surface so that the entire lake bed is zoned. Defendants\u2019 submerged land is zoned commercial general, while other portions of the lake bed are zoned residential.\nIn August, 1966 defendants purchased the property in question, after having procured preliminary architectural plans for the construction of four apartment buildings. Apartment buildings Nos. 1 and 2 were to be constructed partly on the upland, but would extend approximately 130 feet out into the lake, supported on two finger-like piers secured by cement pilings. Apartments Nos. 3 and 4 were to be constructed entirely on the upland abutting the lake. Mortgage commitments were obtained based on these plans, and on June 12, 1967, a building permit was issued by the city of Seattle.\nOn June 5, 1967, excavation of the upland was commenced and on June 8 or 9 dirt was first pushed into the lake about 25 feet in order to form a base or pad. Some of the plaintiffs immediately protested to defendants and began making an investigation to determine the extent of defendants\u2019 construction plans. The protests went unheeded so plaintiffs on July 5, 1967, brought an action to enjoin defendants from filling or building over the surface of the lake. In conjunction with that action they posted a $1,000 bond and obtained an exparte temporary order restraining the defendants from interfering with the surface area and shoreline of Bitter Lake.\nThe motion for a temporary injunction was heard on July 15, 1967, by a different department of the superior court than that which later heard the case on the merits. The court denied the motion but delayed the effective date of the order so that plaintiffs might petition this court for a writ of review. On July 20, 1967, that petition was denied by this court on procedural grounds. It was understood at the time that the ruling did not reach the merits of the petition.\nOn July 21, 1967, the temporary restraining order was dissolved. Plaintiffs then made every effort to get the case to trial and in fact secured a substantially earlier trial date than would have been possible through the normal progression of the trial docket in King County. Trial was commenced on October. 10, 1967.\nPending the trial on the merits, defendants proceeded as rapidly as possible with the construction of apartment No. 1 and the concrete slab to support it. The slab projects out into the lake approximately 130 feet and is 77 feet wide. Beneath it the lake is filled with dirt, and pilings of steel beams are used to support it. The slab will be 1.18 feet above high water and 6.18 feet above low water. The apartment constructed on the slab will be three stories in height. At the time of trial it was planned that both apartments Nos. 1 and 2 would extend out over the water. However, in oral argument in this court defendants stated that the plans for apartment No. 2 had been modified so that it would be constructed entirely on upland.\nThe trial court determined that defendants had no right to build out into Bitter Lake, and enjoined them from further construction over the surface of the lake. In addition, defendants were ordered to remove the existing structure and earth fill, which had been put there during the period prior to the trial.\nDefendants\u2019 12 assignments of error are directed to (1) the trial court\u2019s determination that defendants had no right to build out into Bitter Lake, (2) the remedy granted in view of hardship caused to defendants relative to hardship plaintiffs would suffer if the mandatory injunction were denied, (3) prejudice of the trial judge in view of his personal experience as attorney in a prior case which dealt with surface rights of lake shore owners, (4) the trial court\u2019s findings that defendants disregarded protests of plaintiffs and the pendency of this suit, and its failure to include a specific finding on defendants\u2019 good faith, and (5) the trial court\u2019s failure to find adverse possession of the area in question by defendants\u2019 predecessor in title.\nIn the challenge to the trial court\u2019s determination that defendants had no right to build out into Bitter Lake, defendants emphasize the effect of the commercial zoning imposed on their property. Defendants contend that their apartment is a riparian use, and that reasonableness is the test for its permissibility. They further contend that reasonableness in this case is a legislative determination expressed in the city zoning ordinance. In other words, the Seattle City Council, by conferring a commercial general zoning classification on this property, and issuing a building permit, determined that an apartment is a reasonable and proper use of this tract, which includes lake bed property.\nRiparian rights and privileges are conferred upon a property owner by virtue of the contiguity of his property to a body of water. Mayer v. Grueber, 29 Wis. 2d 168, 138 N.W.2d 197 (1965). Although we have never promulgated an all-inclusive definition of riparian rights, we have previously recognized as riparian rights on nonnavigable lakes the rights of swimming, fishing, boating, and bathing. Snively v. Jaber, 48 Wn.2d 815, 296 P.2d 1015, 57 A.L.R.2d 560 (1956). Further, these rights have been characterized as vested property interests, included in the protection afforded by Const, art. 1 \u00a7 16, which provides that private property shall not be taken or damaged for public or private use without just compensation. In re Clinton Water Dist., 36 Wn.2d 284, 218 P.2d 309 (1950).\nWe cannot agree that defendants\u2019 apartment constructed over water constitutes a riparian use, or that its permissibility comes within a rule of reasonableness as determined by the Seattle zoning authorities.\nMere proximity of the apartment to the water does not render it a riparian use. With respect to a structure, such a use must be so intimately associated with the water that apart from the water its utility would be seriously impaired. This is not the case with defendants\u2019 prospective use. The utility of the apartment is in no way dependent upon the waters of Bitter Lake, and its utility as an apartment would be in no way impaired apart from this lake. This is evidenced by the fact that apartments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 are entirely on upland property.\nNor may defendants justify the presence of their apartment by the commercial zoning classification imposed by the city of Seattle or by the issuance of a building permit.\nAll riparian owners along the shore of a natural, nonnavigable lake share in common the right to use the entire surface of the lake for boating, swimming, fishing, and other similar riparian rights so long as there is no unreasonable interference with the exercise of these rights by other respective owners. Snively v. Jaber, supra; Botton v. State, 69 Wn.2d 751, 420 P.2d 352 (1966) , These rights are vested property rights, and may not be taken or damaged for public or private use without just compensation. In re Clinton Water Dist., supra. It follows, therefore, that while the city of Seattle might regulate the exercise of these rights by means of its police power, it may not totally divest plaintiffs of them through the mechanisms of zoning. Indeed, the effect of this case, if we were to follow defendants\u2019 reasoning, would be to divest plaintiffs of valuable property rights for the private use and benefit of defendants. Such a result is clearly contrary to the law, and we are certain was not intended by the Seattle zoning authorities when the commercial general classification was placed on defendants\u2019 property.\nDefendants next assert error in the trial court\u2019s choice of remedy, in that defendants were required to remove the structure it placed out over the surface of the lake. It must be noted, in response to this assertion, that since we have determined that defendants\u2019 apartment does not constitute a riparian use, it becomes in effect an encroachment upon plaintiffs\u2019 common rights to use this portion of the lake surface for purposes of riparian enjoyment. In view of this, it is defendants\u2019 contention that nonetheless, an application of the doctrine of relative hardship, or balancing the equities, requires that they not be enjoined to remove the existing structure now in place. Although it is not clear from the evidence, the amount of loss might be substantial that defendants could suffer if unable to complete apartment No. 1. Estimates by the plaintiffs based on defendants\u2019 figures fix the maximum possible loss at approximately $100,000. Defendants on the other hand contend they will lose in excess of $250,000. The evidence indicates, however, that when it became apparent that defendants faced a lawsuit to halt construction of apartment No. 1 with the ever existing possibility that they might lose, they took no action to mitigate their potential loss by attempting to renegotiate or cancel the construction contracts or other financial commitments. At that time only a small proportion of the total financial commitment had actually been expended and the remaining potential loss depended on the binding effect of the commitments, most of which were oral in nature, the rigidity of the other contracting parties position, and the feasibility of altering construction plans.\nFrom the very commencement of defendants\u2019 construction they were aware of the protests of other riparian owners. The encroaching structure did not exist at the time of suit, but was built during the pendency of this suit. Defendant contractor, Mr. Ray Lotto, testified that after the temporary restraining order was dissolved \u201cwe proceeded as fast as we could, because, at that time, we already lost two weeks.\u201d\nThus, defendants proceeded to construct the apartment in question with full knowledge that their right to do so was contested and that there was a real likelihood, in view of our holding in Snively v. Jaber, supra, that the case on the merits would be decided against them. In addition, the court in its oral opinion dissolving the temporary restraining order, pointed out that the case was going to be appealed, would be a landmark case, and the Supreme Court might look at it differently. During oral arguments defendants\u2019 counsel admitted that they knowingly took a risk by continuing construction while the case was pending on the merits, and indeed, there is no other possible interpretation of defendants\u2019 conduct. Their explanation was that although not much construction had been done on apartment No. 1 they were already financially committed to the entire project and felt they had to take the risk.\nThe benefit of the doctrine of balancing the equities, or relative hardship, is reserved for the innocent defendant who proceeds without knowledge or warning that his structure encroaches upon another\u2019s property or property rights. City of Dunsmuir v. Silva, 154 Cal. App. 2d 825, 317 P.2d 653 (1957); Winthers v. Bertrand, 239 Ore. 97, 396 P.2d 570 (1964). Under the circumstances of this case, defendants are not entitled to evoke the benefit of this doctrine.\nDefendants next assert that the bias of the trial judge prevented them from having a fair trial. This assignment is based on the prior experience of the trial judge as counsel for Dr. J. Howard Snively, who was subsequently a party in Snively v. Jaber, supra. Although the trial judge did not represent Dr. Snively in that suit, he did offer legal advice to him. Defendants argue that that experience prejudiced the judge\u2019s views on the issue of defendants\u2019 good faith and caused him to prejudge the case even before the trial started.\nRCW 4.12.040 provides in part:\nNo judge of a superior court of the state of Washington shall sit to hear or try any action or proceeding when it shall be established as hereinafter provided that said judge is prejudiced against any party or attorney, or the interest of any party or attorney appearing in such cause.\nClearly, defendants show no prejudice which comes within the requirements of this statute. Merely because a judge has had occasion to study a point of law and offer advice based on his interpretation of it is no grounds for disqualification. This assignment is without merit. '\nDefendants charge error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to find that defendants\u2019 predecessor in interest, Playland Amusement Park, established the exclusive right to use the disputed portion of the lake by adverse possession. We find no merit to this contention in light of testimony of a former park policeman that his intentions were only to prevent persons from entering the park without paying the entrance fee. There was no evidence that other riparian owners were ever prevented from using the entire surface of the lake, or that the operators of Playland Amusement Park ever intended to assert any proprietary rights over portions of the surface abutting its shore. Indeed, certain residents of Bitter Lake testified that they had always used the entire surface of the lake, including portions over the area owned by defendants, even while Playland was in operation. In any event, it was a disputed question of fact and as there was substantial evidence to support the finding of the trial court, it will not be disturbed on appeal. State ex rel. Carroll v. Seattle Hotel Bldg. Corp., 41 Wn.2d 595, 250 P.2d 982 (1952).\nDefendants next assign error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. The evidence was the testimony of a daughter of defendants\u2019 predecessor in interest and related to the question of adverse use of that portion of the lake in dispute. The substance of her testimony was before the trial judge by way of affidavit in support of the motion. It was to some extent cumulative in nature, and we do not feel that the court abused its discretion in denying the motion.\nDefendants finally argue that under Hughes v. Washington, 389 U.S. 290, 19 L. Ed. 530, 88 Sup. Ct. 438 (1967), the federal common law controls the result here; and that under the federal common law the defendants have a right to build their apartment on a fill on their portion of the lake bed.\nThis contention is based on the fact that defendants\u2019 title is to upland property and submerged land, and is traced to an 1872 federal government patent. This patent was issued prior to Washington statehood, and made no reference to the lake.\nIn Hughes, supra, the issue presented was whether federal or state laws governs the ownership of accreted land, gradually deposited by the ocean on adjoining upland property conveyed by the United States to petitioner\u2019s predecessor in title prior to Washington statehood. The United States Supreme Court held that federal law applied, and that under federal law petitioner was entitled to the accretion that had gradually formed along her ocean-front property.\nThe Hughes decision is in no way applicable to the instant case. We are not concerned here with the ownership of land or the extent or validity of title created by a federal act. As stated by Mr. Justice Stewart, concurring in Hughes, 389 U.S. at 295:\nSurely it must be conceded as a general proposition that the law of real property is, under our Constitution, left to the individual States to develop and administer. And surely Washington or any other State is free to make changes, either legislative or judicial, in its general rules of real property law, including the rules governing the property rights of riparian owners. Nor are riparian owners who derive their title from the United States somehow immune from the changing impact of these general state rules. Joy v. St. Louis, 201 U. S. 332, 342. For if they were, then the property law of a State like Washington, carved entirely out of federal territory, would be forever frozen into the mold it occupied on the date of the State\u2019s admission to the Union.\nWe must, therefore, conclude that there was no error in the trial court\u2019s determination of the property rights of the riparian owners on Bitter Lake, nor in the remedy afforded in the form of a mandatory injunction.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nFinley, C. J., Weaver, Hunter, and McGovern, JJ., concur.\nJanuary 24,1969. Petition for rehearing denied.\nJudge Williams is serving as a judge pro tempore of the Supreme Court pursuant to Art. 4, \u00a7 2(a) (amendment 38), state constitution..\nOther jurisdictions which have adopted this same rule are represented by the following cases: Harris v. Brooks, 225 Ark. 436, 283 S.W.2d 129 (1955); Burt v. Munger, 314 Mich. 659, 23 N.W.2d 117 (1946); Flynn v. Beisel, 257 Minn. 531, 102 N.W.2d 284 (1960); State Game & Fish Comm\u2019n v.

    "Rosellini, J.\nThis suit was brought by the owner of a resort at the old townsite of Monte Cristo, in Snohomish county, to recover damages for the flooding of his property. It was alleged in the complaint that the defendants, who, in the fall of 1955, logged the land above the resort under a contract with the plaintiff, had negligently deposited logs and debris in Sunday Creek, which flowed through the logging area and down through the resort area, and that during the winter of 1955-56 this debris had caused a dam to form in the creek, which broke in the spring and flooded the plaintiff\u2019s resort. The plaintiff also sought recovery on nuisance and contract theories, but the contract theory was subsequently abandoned. The defendants\u2019 answers were general denials.\nThe cause was tried to the court, which found that the plaintiff had failed to sustain the burden of proving that the damage was caused by the acts of the defendants and gave judgment for the latter. On appeal, error is assigned to this finding and to the conclusions of law which were based thereon.\nThe parties, in their evidence which the trial court heard and weighed, presented at least three theories as to how the flooding of the plaintiff\u2019s property occurred: (1) that the debris left after the defendants\u2019 logging operation formed a dam which later broke, causing the water and debris to be washed upon the plaintiff\u2019s resort property; (2) that a dam of this sort was caused by debris which had previously accumulated in the creek from natural causes and prior logging operations or by a combination of old and new debris; and (3) that the flooding was caused by the unusually high waters which occurred that winter, from which the damage would have resulted regardless of the presence of the debris left by the defendants.\nIn its memorandum decision, the court noted that a dam could well have been formed above, or below the defendants\u2019 logging area, or high water could have picked up logs and debris outside the banks of the creek. There were no eyewitnesses to the occurrence, nor had anyone viewed the scene from the time the logging operation was closed until after the damage was done in the spring. Testimony was offered by persons familiar with the locality, with the proper conduct of logging operations, and with the various factors which may cause such floods.\nThe trial court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to sustain the burden of proving that, but for the debris deposited in the creek during the defendants\u2019 logging operations, the flood would not have occurred. It applied the rule in Home Ins. Co. of N. Y. v. Northern Pac. R. Co., 18 Wn. (2d) 798, 140 P. (2d) 507, 147 A. L. R. 849, and quoted in Cambro Co. v. Snook, 43 Wn. (2d) 609, 262 P. (2d) 767, as follows:\n\u201cThe rule is well established that the existence of a fact or facts cannot rest in guess, speculation, or conjecture. It is also the rule that the one having the affirmative of an issue does not have to make proof to an absolute certainty. It is sufficient if his evidence affords room for men of reasonable minds to conclude that there is a greater probability that the thing in question, such as the occurrence of a fire, happened in such a way as to fix liability upon the person charged therewith than it is that it happened in a way for which a person charged would not be liable.\u201d\nThe theory of the plaintiff in that case was that a fire which damaged his property was caused when some unnamed employee of the defendant was using an acetylene torch and carelessly permitted the flame to come in contact with some wooden portion of the building. The defendant sought to rebut this theory by showing that the fire could have occurred in some other manner. Consequently, the court said, it had nothing more tangible to proceed upon than two conjectural theories, one of which could as reasonably have been adopted as the other.\nThe rule of Cambro v. Snook, supra, was recently reap-proved in Mason v. Turner, 48 Wn. (2d) 145, 291 P. (2d) 1023.\nThe plaintiff urges that, upon his evidence, the court was bound to conclude that the flood was caused by the debris left by the defendants. However, he ignores the evidence which was given in support of the conflicting theories, which the trial court found equally plausible. A review of the record has convinced us that the trial court was not in error in finding that the plaintiff had failed to sustain the burden of showing the cause of the damage to his property. Whether the action be founded on a theory of negligence or of nuisance, the acts or omissions of the defendant must be shown to be the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s damage, or he cannot recover.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nHill, C. J., Donworth, Finley, and Foster, JJ., concur."

    "Utter, J.\nJames McCready and others opposed to Seattle\u2019s Residential Housing Inspection Program challenge four inspections of two apartment buildings, one executed under a warrant and three pursuant to tenant consent. This is the second appeal arising from Seattle v. McCready, 123 Wn.2d 260, 868 P.2d 134 (1994) (McCready I), a declaratory judgment action filed by the City of Seattle (City). The first appeal was filed after the King County Superior Court ruled for the City on its claims (McCready I). This direct appeal is from an order dismissing the counterclaims and third party complaint filed in the City\u2019s action.\nAppellants raise two principal issues. The first is whether tenants of an apartment building have the authority to consent to a City inspection of their rental units and the common areas of their apartment building. Appellants contend such searches violate a landlord\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment and Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7. The second issue is whether the municipal court possesses authority to issue administrative search warrants based on probable cause.\nThe factual context of this case is fully set forth in Mc-Cready I. It is summarized briefly here for ease of reference.\nIn July 1987, the City adopted an ordinance which directed the Department of Construction and Land Use (Department) to implement a housing code inspection program. Under this program, the Department inspected 350 multifamily housing units throughout the city. Approximately 78 percent of the inspected buildings had code violations, some of them serious. Of the buildings with code violations, over 80 percent had no previous complaints of violations.\nBased on this demonstration project, the Department concluded that inspecting only in response to complaints was an ineffective method of ensuring compliance with the housing code. The Department recommended the City adopt a \"proactive\u201d program of housing inspections. In September 1989, after receiving the Department\u2019s report and recommendation, the City adopted a resolution which directed the executive to design and propose an enforcement program for the Housing and Building Maintenance Code. The Department subsequently selected some 30 percent of Seattle\u2019s multifamily apartment buildings for inspection. The Department sent a letter to the owners of these buildings, informing each of a forthcoming inspection. The Department also sent each tenant an information packet and a postcard to return to the Department indicating whether they consented to the inspection.\nSeveral apartment owners urged their own and other tenants to refuse to consent to the inspections on the ground such inspections were unconstitutional invasions of privacy and would significantly raise rents. Of the 8,000 requests the Department sent to tenants, it \"received\u201d over 6,000 refusals. Meanwhile, a group of landlords filed a class action against the City, challenging the rental housing registration fee which funds the housing inspections.\nThat same year, the City filed suit against the McCreadys and several other landlords seeking to have its housing inspection program declared valid. The City also requested the court issue a number of inspection warrants. The trial court granted the City\u2019s application for several warrants. The McCreadys immediately appealed, Seattle v. McCready, 123 Wn.2d 260, 868 P.2d 134 (1994), and also filed a counterclaim against the City seeking damages and attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988. The counterclaim pleading is not part of the record. It appears however that it related to three inspections conducted with the consent of the tenants and a fourth inspection based on a warrant issued by the Seattle municipal court after an exterior inspection of the building revealed housing code violations. The trial court granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the counterclaim. The McCreadys appeal directly to this court.\nUnlike the warrants challenged in McCready I, those challenged here were issued on the basis of probable cause to believe building code violations existed in the buildings to be inspected. We are now asked to decide the question Mc-Cready I did not explicitly reach, namely whether a municipal court possesses the authority to issue an administrative search warrant supported by probable cause.\nI\nInspections Conducted Pursuant to Tenant Consent\nThree of the warrantless inspections challenged were conducted pursuant to tenant consent. If we hold their consent valid, the absence of a warrant is immaterial because consent vitiates the need for a warrant. Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854, 93 S. Ct. 2041 (1973). The first and dispositive issue we address with respect to these searches, then, is whether the tenants could consent to a search of their respective dwellings and the common areas leading to those dwellings.\nAppellants concede that consensual inspections do not require a warrant, Opening Br. of Appellants, at 33, and they do not dispute the inspections were conducted pursuant to tenant consent. Rather, they contend that tenant consent is insufficient to authorize an inspection because landlords have an equal or paramount interest in the property they lease to others, and their consent is therefore required as well.\nA\nIndividual Apartments\nAppellants\u2019 challenge to the legality of the apartment inspections is premised on the notion that a landlord\u2019s right to exclude others is equal or superior to a tenant\u2019s. That assumption is unwarranted under both the federal and state constitutions.\nThe United States Supreme Court has indicated that under the Fourth Amendment, tenants, not landlords, have a privacy interest in leased residences. Chapman v. United States, 365 U.S. 610, 616-17, 5 L. Ed. 2d 828, 81 S. Ct. 776 (1961). In Chapman, a tenant successfully challenged a warrantless search carried out with the landlord\u2019s consent. The court held the landlord had no authority to consent to a search of property leased to and occupied by others; the tenant enjoyed the privacy right in the leased premises, and only the tenant could waive that right. In the realm of housing code inspections, the Court reached the same result: without the tenant\u2019s consent, a warrant was necessary to authorize an inspection of rented premises. Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 18 L. Ed. 2d 930, 87 S. Ct. 1727 (1967). See also In re 728 Belmont Ave., 24 N.C. App. 17, 22-23, 210 S.E.2d 73, 77 (1974) (Camara \"gives rise to the clear implication that the Supreme Court considered the Fourth Amendment privilege personal to the occupant of the place to be searched.\u201d).\nAlthough the issue whether a tenant may consent to a search of his or her leased apartment is one of first impression in Washington, we have previously approved the reasoning of both Chapman and Camara in the context of Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7. See State v. Mathe, 102 Wn.2d 537, 543, 688 P.2d 859 (1984); King Cy. v. Primeau, 98 Wn.2d 321, 329, 654 P.2d 1199 (1982).\nOther courts considering this issue have held that tenants may consent to searches of their leased premises. Appellants cite no authority to the contrary. The reason a tenant may consent to a search of his or her leased premises has been explained as follows:\n[I]t is the right of possession rather than the right of ownership which ordinarily determines who may consent to a police search of a particular place. Thus, the landlord and tenant cannot be said to have \"common authority\u201d over rented premises, as that phrase is used in United States v. Matlock [415 U.S. 164, 171, 39 L. Ed. 2d 242, 94 S. Ct. 988 (1974)]; the tenant\u2019s right is superior, and thus the landlord cannot give consent which will be effective against the tenant. It logically follows, as the cases have held when the issue has presented itself, that the tenant may consent to a search of the leased premises during the term of the lease and that evidence found in a search based upon this consent is admissible against the landlord.\n(Footnotes omitted.) 3 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 8.5, at 298-99 (2d ed. 1987). Because the tenant, not the landlord, has the privacy interest in the leased premises, we join the jurisdictions which hold that tenants possess the authority to consent to a search of their individual apartment units, notwithstanding any objections by their landlords.\nB\nCommon Areas\nAppellants also contend the tenants lacked authority to consent to a search of the common areas of the apartment buildings because the landlords have exclusive authority over those areas. The argument is unpersuasive under both the federal and state constitutions.\nContrary to Appellants\u2019 assertion, landlords do not have exclusive authority over the common areas. In order to admit visitors to an apartment, the tenant must necessarily possess the authority to permit guests to pass through the common areas leading to that apartment. The tenant must therefore possess the authority to consent to the visitor\u2019s entry into the building itself. For that reason, the authority over common areas is more properly characterized as common to both tenant and landlord, rather than exclusive to the landlord alone.\nAs regards searches of common areas, under both the Fourth Amendment and Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7, either of two parties who have common authority over the premises may consent to an entry or search. The United States Supreme Court has explained the meaning of common authority as follows:\nCommon authority is, of course, not to be implied from the mere property interest a third party has in the property. The authority which justifies the third-party consent. . . rests . . . on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.\nUnited States v. Matlock, 415 U.S. 164, 171 n.7, 39 L. Ed. 2d 242, 94 S. Ct. 988 (1974).\nIn State v. Mathe, 102 Wn.2d 537, 543-44, 688 P.2d 859 (1984), we adopted the \"common authority\u201d standard as the proper approach to determining questions of consent under Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7. In that case, we emphasized two points: (1) the consenting party must be able to permit the search in his or her own right, and (2) it must be reasonable to find the defendant has assumed the risk another might permit a search.\nBoth elements of the Mathe inquiry are met in this case. The tenants had authority to consent to the search of the common areas in their own right. Common authority rests \"on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes.\u201d Matlock, supra at 171 n.7. The simple fact of common tenant access to these areas supports this finding.\nLandlords in Washington assume the risk tenants might permit a search of common areas. Assumption of risk can be imputed to landlords by virtue of the landlord-tenant act, the legislative context within which landlords lease premises to tenants in Washington.\nThe landlord-tenant act clearly expresses a legislative concern to assure the fitness of residential tenancies through the conduct of necessary inspections.\nThe Legislature has found that \"some tenants live in residences that are substandard and dangerous to their health and safety\u201d. RCW 59.18.115(1). It has accordingly provided that under certain circumstances, where a landlord fails to fulfill the statutory obligation to keep the premises fit for habitation, \"the landlord shall have no power or authority to prohibit entry for the inspection\u201d. RCW 59.18.115(2)(c). Given the statutory design, and the legislative concern which underlies it, we deem that landlords operating residential apartment houses in Washington assume the risk tenants will consent to inspections of common areas.\nRelying on State v. Leach, 113 Wn.2d 735, 744, 782 P.2d 1035 (1989), Appellants maintain that because they share authority over common areas, the tenants could not consent to the inspection of those areas. Leach is inapposite. That case only held \"the consent of one who possesses common authority over premises or effects is valid as against the absent, nonconsenting person with whom that authority is shared.\u201d Leach, 113 Wn.2d at 739 (citing Matlock, at 170). Leach does not control the outcome of this case because the landlords do not assert they were present when the tenants consented to the inspections of the common areas.\nBecause the consent was valid in three of the four instances in which the apartments and common areas were inspected, Appellants\u2019 challenge to the legality of those inspections fails.\nII\nInspections Conducted Pursuant to a Warrant\nIn the case before us, one inspection was conducted without consent, pursuant to an administrative inspection warrant. Appellants argue this warrant was invalid under Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7 because the Seattle Municipal Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to issue civil warrants under the circumstances here present. They also maintain the warrant was invalid under the Fourth Amendment because it was too broad in scope, was unsupported by probable cause, and was issued ex parte. Appellants prevail on their state constitutional claim, but not on their federal claim.\nA\nThe State Constitution: Municipal Court Authority To Issue Administrative Search Warrants Based on Probable Cause\nIn McCready I, a number of Seattle landowners argued the inspection warrants issued by the Superior Court pursuant to the Residential Housing Inspection Program violated Const. art. 1, \u00a7 7 because they were issued by a magistrate who lacked the authority to issue such warrants. We agreed, and quashed the warrants.\nThe rationale underlying our disposition of McCready I is that municipal courts have no inherent authority to issue administrative inspection warrants, and that no statutory or rule-based authority exists to issue warrants on less than probable cause. McCready I, at 272-76. Unlike the warrants challenged in McCready I, however, the warrant here was issued on the basis of probable cause to believe building code violations existed in the building to be inspected. We are now asked to decide the question McCready I did not explicitly reach, whether a municipal court may issue an administrative search warrant supported by probable cause.\nBecause municipal courts have no inherent authority to issue administrative search warrants, they must rely on an authorizing statute or court rule. McCready I. Of the statutes and court rules cited by the City, none authorizes the issuance of administrative inspection warrants supported by probable cause to believe a civil infraction, rather than a crime, has occurred.\nFor example, one potentially relevant source of authority for issuing search warrants is RCW 10.79.015, which states:\nAny such magistrate, when satisfied that there is reasonable cause, may . . . upon . . . complaint made on oath, issue search warrant in the following cases, to wit:\n(1) To search for and seize any counterfeit or spurious coin, or forged instruments, or tools, machines or materials, prepared or provided for making either of them.\n(2) To search for and seize any gaming apparatus used or kept, and to be used in any unlawful gaming house, or in any building, apartment or place, resorted to for the purpose of unlawful gaming.\n(3) To search for and seize any evidence material to the investigation or prosecution of any homicide or felony ....\n(4) To search for and seize any instrument, apparatus or device used to obtain telephone or telegraph service in violation of RCW 9.45.240.\nNone of the above provisions apply to the facts of this case.\nBy court rule, this court has expanded RCW 10.79.015 to provide for the issuance of warrants to search for evidence of any crime. See CrR 2.3(b)(1) (governing superior courts); CrRLJ 2.3(b)(1) (governing courts of limited jurisdiction). Neither rule, however, authorizes the issuance of a warrant based on evidence of civil infractions.\nCrR 2.3(b) and CrRLJ 2.3(b) provide:\nProperty or Persons Which May Be Seized With a Warrant. A warrant may be issued under this rule to search for and seize any (1) evidence of a crime; or (2) contraband, the fruits of crime, or things otherwise criminally possessed; or (3) weapons or other things by means of which a crime has been committed or reasonably appears about to be committed; or (4) person for whose arrest there is probable cause, or who is unlawfully restrained.\nUnder these rules, the municipal court has authority to issue administrative search warrants supported by probable cause only if the application for the inspection warrant alleges a housing code violation which constitutes a crime rather than a civil infraction. In this case, although the warrant application alleged violations of the housing code in general, there was no specific allegation those violations constituted a crime. See Application for Warrant; Clerk\u2019s Papers, at 350. Consequently, the warrant issued by the Municipal Court was without authority of law and must be quashed under McCready I.\nB\nThe Federal Constitution: Validity of the Warrant Under the Fourth Amendment\nAppellants also claim the warrant violated their Fourth Amendment rights because it was too broad in scope, was unsupported by probable cause, and was issued ex parte. All three arguments are unpersuasive.\nThe warrant was not too broad in scope. The challenged warrant authorized the inspection of \"1737 Belmont\u201d. Appellants claim the warrant is invalid because it did not specify the particular apartments to be inspected. Yet there is no evidence the City sought this warrant to gain access to individual apartment units. That the warrant authorized only the inspection of common areas is implicit in its general language, and is attested by the facts of this case: the City did not rely on the warrant to enter individual apartments without tenant consent.\nContrary to the Appellants\u2019 contention, the warrant was supported by probable cause. The warrant application for 1737 Belmont Avenue was based on a declaration of Matthew Moeller, a housing and zoning inspector for the Department of Construction and Land Use of the City of Seattle. See Application for Warrant; Clerk\u2019s Papers, at 350-51. He personally observed housing code violations on the exterior of the building, including deteriorated rear stair assembly, exposed electrical wiring, and broken windows. Declaration of Matthew Moeller; Clerk\u2019s Papers, at 353. This evidence reasonably suggested the building was being inadequately maintained. It therefore supported the issuance of a warrant to inspect the interior common areas for signs of similar violations.\nFinally, the authority cited by Appellants for the proposition administrative search warrants may not be issued ex parte is inapposite. See Br. of Appellants, at 25-26 (citing Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 18 L. Ed. 2d 930, 87 S. Ct. 1727 (1967); See v. Seattle, 387 U.S. 541, 18 L. Ed. 2d 943, 87 S. Ct. 1737 (1966)). Unlike the inspections challenged here, both Camara and See involved administrative searches conducted in the absence of either consent or a warrant.\nBecause the Appellants have failed to establish a violation of their federal constitutional rights, they are not entitled to damages or attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 1988.\nThe validity of the inspections conducted pursuant to tenant consent is affirmed; the inspection warrant issued by the Municipal Court is quashed because it was issued without the \"authority of law\u201d required by article 1, section 7 of the Washington State Constitution.\nAndersen, C.J., and Brachtenbach, Dolliver, Durham, Smith, Guy, and Johnson, JJ., concur.\nReconsideration denied October 31, 1994.\nThe same issue was presented in Cranwell v. Mesec, cause 60385-5, which this Court transferred to Division One "

    "Johnson, J.\nAt issue is whether appellants must file a claim for damages with the City of Seattle (Seattle or City) pursuant to Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) 5.24.005 as a condition precedent to bringing an action against the City under RCW 64.40.020. King County Superior Court dismissed appellants' lawsuit for failure to first file such a claim. We reverse.\nI\nOn August 25, 1989, appellants Robert Wilson, John Tar-diff, and Wilson Realty Exchange, Inc. (hereafter Wilson) applied to the Seattle Department of Construction and Land Use (DCLU) for a master use permit to short plat their property into two parcels of land. On January 22, 1990, DCLU conditionally granted the master use permit application. Maple Leaf Community Council appealed the City's approval of the permit to Seattle's hearing examiner. After the expiration of the applicable appeal period but before the hearing, DCLU determined the master use permit for the short plat had been issued in error and withdrew its approval on March 29, 1990. As a result, the examiner canceled the hearing scheduled for May 2, 1990, over Wilson's objection.\nOn May 2, 1990, Wilson filed a complaint against Seattle, seeking equitable relief and monetary damages for the City's failure to promptly process the short plat application. Six claims were asserted, including a claim under RCW 64.40-.020, a statutorily created cause of action for damages to property rights caused by governmental actions in processing permit applications. In its answer, Seattle asserted an affirmative defense that Wilson had failed to first file a claim with the City pursuant to SMC 5.24.005.\nSeattle moved for partial summary judgment, and Wilson moved for voluntary nonsuit to dismiss all of its claims except the cause of action under RCW 64.40.020. King County Superior Court dismissed all of the claims, including the one under RCW 64.40.020, for failure to comply with SMC 5.24-.005. Wilson appealed. This court accepted certification from the Court of Appeals and granted direct review.\nII\nRCW 64.40 creates a statutory cause of action and remedy for owners of property interests damaged by agency actions in processing land use permit applications. The statute states:\nOwners of a property interest who have filed an application for a permit have an action for damages to obtain relief from acts of an agency which are arbitrary, capricious, unlawful, or exceed lawful authority, or relief from a failure to act within time limits established by law . . ..\nRCW 64.40.020(1). \"Agency\" is defined as the State of Washington and any of its political subdivisions, including cities such as Seattle, exercising regulatory authority or control over the use of real property in the state. RCW 64.40.010(1). \"Damages\" mean reasonable expenses and losses incurred between the time a cause of action arises and relief is granted, but does not include speculative damages, diminution in value or damage to real property. RCW 64.40.010(4).\nSeattle contends that before Wilson can file a cause of action under RCW 64.40.020 for damages caused by Seattle's delay in processing its permit application, Wilson must file a claim with the City for damages pursuant to SMC 5.24.005. The ordinance states in part:\nA. No action shall be commenced against the City in which monetary damages are being claimed until a written Claim for Damages has been presented to and filed with the City Clerk----\nC. A lawsuit based upon the allegations of a Claim for Damages may not be instituted against the City within sixty (60) days of the filing of such claim, unless the applicable statute of limitations will expire within that period of time. The requirements of this section shall not affect in any manner'the commencement and running of any applicable statute of limitations.\nSMC 5.24.005.\nThe issue in this case turns on the doctrine of sovereign immunity, which flows from the medieval English concept that one could not sue the King in his own courts. See 57 Am. Jur. 2d Municipal, County, School, and State Tort Liability \u00a7\u00a7 1-2 (1988). The general principle that the sovereign cannot be sued without its own consent applies with ftdl force to states. 72 Am. Jur. 2d States, Territories, and Dependencies \u00a7 99 (1974). The immunity of a municipality, however, derives solely from the state as sovereign, 57 Am. Jur. 2d, supra \u00a7 6, and the municipality thus has only as much immunity as its sovereign. Kelso v. Tacoma, 63 Wn.2d 913, 916-17, 390 P.2d 2 (1964) (citing Hutton v. Martin, 41 Wn.2d 780, 784, 252 P.2d 581 (1953)).\nMunicipal claims ordinances, such as SMC 5.24.005, are in part an exercise of sovereign immunity in that they place limitations or qualifications on the ability of individuals to sue the government. See Daggs v. Seattle, 110 Wn.2d 49, 52, 750 P.2d 626 (1988). Under such ordinances, a city will require notice and presentation of a claim before allowing a suit for damages to be brought. 56 Am. Jur. 2d Municipal Corporations, Counties, and Other Political Subdivisions \u00a7 680 (1971). Compliance is mandatory, and failure to comply bars a claimant from maintaining an action in court. See Lewis v. Mercer Island, 63 Wn. App. 29, 32-33, 817 P.2d 408, review denied, 117 Wn.2d 1024 (1991); former RCW 35.31.030. Whether Seattle's claims-filing ordinance is a valid exercise of sovereign immunity thus depends on whether it is authorized by its sovereign, the State.\nA\nSeattle first argues its ordinance is authorized by RCW 4.96.010, which provides a city may require the filing of a claim as a condition precedent to bringing a lawsuit. Wilson argues, however, this statute only authorizes the filing of claims for damages sounding in tort and does not apply to claims under RCW 64.40.020. We agree with Wilson.\nIn 1963, the Washington State Legislature abolished the State's sovereign immunity for tort liability. RCW 4.92.090 (Laws of 1963, ch. 159, \u00a7 2); Kelso, 63 Wn.2d at 918. In 1967, the Legislature extended this abrogation of sovereign immunity to all its political subdivisions, including cities such as Seattle. RCW 4.96.010 (Laws of 1967, ch. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 18). RCW 4.96.010 does preserve a municipality's right to require the filing of a damages claim with the municipality before bringing a lawsuit, but only for claims sounding in tort. It states:\nAll local governmental entities, whether acting in a governmental or proprietary capacity, shall be hable for damages arising out of their tortious conduct, or the tortious conduct of their past or present officers, employees, or volunteers while performing or in good faith purporting to perform their official duties, to the same extent as if they were a private person or corporation. Filing a claim for damages within the time allowed by law shall be a condition precedent to the commencement of any action claiming damages. ...\nRCW 4.96.0KX1).\nThe case most directly on point is El Coba Co. Dormitories, Inc. v. Franklin Cy. PUD, 82 Wn.2d 858, 514 P.2d 524 (1973). In El Coba, this court held filing a claim with a PUD under RCW 4.96.010 is a condition precedent only to commencing an action for damages arising from tortious conduct; filing a claim is not required for other types of actions such as a breach of contract. El Coba, 82 Wn.2d at 863. The court reasoned that prior to the enactment of RCW 4.96.010, damages were broadly construed to mean either damages for breach of contract or tort, see Puget Constr. Co. v. Pierce Cy., 64 Wn.2d 453, 457, 392 P.2d 227 (1964), so the filing of a claim with the PUD was required for both types of actions. When the Legislature enacted RCW 4.96.010 abolishing sovereign immunity, it did not use the previous broader language requiring the filing of a claim for \"damages\". Instead, the Legislature required claims only for \"damages arising out of tortious conduct\". The court construed this narrower language as evincing a legislative intent to limit the requirement of filing a claim with the PUD to only claims for tortious damages. The requirement of filing a claim for damages arising out of an alleged breach of contract was eliminated. El Coba, 82 Wn.2d at 863.\nThe same analysis applies here. RCW 4.96.010 authorizes only claims-filing ordinances for damages arising from tortious conduct; the statute does not authorize the City of Seattle to require the filing of claims for other types of damages such as breach of contract or special statutory remedies.\nSeattle attempts to distinguish El Coba on the grounds the claims-filing procedure applicable in that case was former RCW 4.96.020(2). See El Coba, 82 Wn.2d at 862. That statute governs the presenting of claims to political subdivisions other them cities, towns, and counties, and by its plain language is limited to the filing of claims \"for damages arising out of tortious conduct\". (Italics ours.) Former RCW 4.96.020(2). However, the procedure for presenting claims to charter cities is governed instead by former RCW 35.31, which Seattle argues is not as limited in scope. Whereas former RCW 4.96.020(2) provides only for filing of claims for damages sounding in tort, former RCW 35.31.020 provides for the filing of \"[a]ll claims for damages\" against a charter city. Seattle argues its claims ordinance, SMC 5.24.005, is thus authorized by former RCW 35.31.020.\nSeattle misconstrues the nature of this statute. Former RCW 35.31.020 is a procedural statute specifying the time period for filing claims. It is not the statute which affirmatively authorizes cities to continue requiring the filing of claims. That authorization is provided by RCW 4.96.010. In addition, former RCW 35.31.020 must be construed in conjunction with former RCW 35.31.010. Both statutes set out procedures for damages claims: one requires residency information, and the other provides the time and form procedures. Former RCW 35.31.010 expressly refers to these as claims for \"damages sounding in tort\". Former RCW 35.31-.010.\nSeattle argues Washington courts have not limited claims ordinances to only tort actions, but have construed \"damages\" to mean any cause of action for damages. Seattle contends its ordinance should be interpreted broadly to include any type of damages claim.\nSeattle is correct that prior to the abrogation of sovereign immunity, claims-filing statutes were construed broadly to include any claim for damages, such as breach of contract or action to recover funds, and not just tort damages. See, e.g., Amende v. Bremerton, 36 Wn.2d 333, 338, 217 P.2d 1049 (1950); State ex rel. Rand v. Seattle, 13 Wn.2d 107, 123-24, 124 P.2d 207 (1942). However, the cases cited by Seattle dating after 1963 construe the validity of claims ordinances only in tort cases. See Daggs, 110 Wn.2d at 52-54 (upholding SMC 5.24.005 claims-filing ordinance for claims by tort victims); Hall v. Niemer, 97 Wn.2d 574, 581-82, 649 P.2d 98 (1982) (upholding validity of claims-filing requirement for tort victims). These cases do not address the validity of a claims ordinance for other types of actions.\nSeattle also cites Lewis v. Mercer Island, 63 Wn. App. 29, 817 P.2d 408.(1991), as support for its contention that claims-filing requirements apply to actions under RCW 64.40. In Lewis, a land developer alleged the City of Mercer Island engaged in unlawful actions which caused him delay and damage in the development of his property. The Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal of his claim for failure to comply with the claims-filing requirements of former RCW 35A.31.030, which governed the procedure for presenting a claim against a code city. Lewis, 63 Wn. App. at 32-33.\nLewis is not dispositive, however, because the court refused to address the same question presented by this case, i.e., whether the plaintiff's cause of action was subject to a claims-filing prerequisite. The court did not address the issue on the grounds it was not raised before the trial court or argued in the plaintiff's opening brief. It is also not clear from the opinion whether the plaintiff's complaint even included a claim under RCW 64.40.020.\nSeattle next argues the plain language of its ordinance requires filing a claim with the City before commencing any action in which \"monetary damages\" are claimed. Because RCW 64.40.020 is an action for monetary damages, Seattle argues the statute falls squarely within the plain language of the ordinance.\nSeattle has the argument backward. The question is not whether the statute falls within the plain language of the ordinance, but whether the ordinance is authorized by the plain language of the statute. A municipal corporation is limited in its powers to those necessarily or fairly implied in or incident to the powers expressly granted by the State; if there is any doubt about whether the power is granted, it must be denied. Employco Personnel Servs., Inc. v. Seattle, 117 Wn.2d 606, 617, 817 P.2d 1373 (1991).\nWe conclude RCW 4.96.010 authorizes the filing of a claim for damages arising from tortious conduct as a condition precedent to bringing a suit, but not for other types of damages claims such as RCW 64.40.020. Neither party argues RCW 64.40.020 creates a cause of action sounding in tort. RCW 64.40.020 is not merely a codification of preexisting common law tort remedies, but is a new cause of action not previously available. The statute expressly states the remedies provided are in addition to any other remedies provided by law. RCW 64.40.040. See Pleas v. Seattle, 49 Wn. App. 825, 841 n.3, 746 P.2d 823 (1987) (stating RCW 64.40 \"is a clear break with the past\"), rev'd on other grounds, 112 Wn.2d 794, 774 P.2d 1158 (1989).\nWe hold the provision in RCW 4.96.010 authorizing the filing of a claim as a condition precedent for bringing suit for damages from tortious conduct does not apply to a cause of action under RCW 64.40.020. Thus, RCW 4.96.010 does not authorize Seattle to apply SMC 5.24.005 to claims under RCW 64.40.020.\nB\nAlthough RCW 4.96.010 abolishes sovereign immunity for tort liability, it does not necessarily abolish sovereign immunity for other kinds of liability. The court must therefore determine whether RCW 64.40.020 also waives sovereign immunity, and if so, whether the City can still condition its liability under the statute by requiring the filing of a claim as a condition precedent to maintaining an action under RCW 64.40.020.\nWilson argues the Legislature waived sovereign immunity by creating this statutory cause of action, and nothing in the statute permits a municipality , to bar or qualify this statutory action through the imposition of a claims-filing requirement. Seattle does not present any arguments directly on this point, but argues generally the Seattle ordinance does not conflict with RCW 64.40.020 because both allow claims for \"monetary damages\".\nThis court recently held that the Legislature, in enacting RCW 64.40, intended to abrogate the rule of vicarious municipal immunity for the quasi-judicial acts of its officials. Lutheran Day Care v. Snohomish Cy., 119 Wn.2d 91, 103, 829 P.2d 746 (1992), cert. denied, 122 L. Ed. 2d 353 (1993). The court held that under RCW 64.40.020 an \"agency\", which includes cities, can be liable for the quasi-judicial acts of its land use officials. Lutheran Day Care, 119 Wn.2d at 111. Given this waiver of immunity, the next question is whether Seattle can limit this waiver through its claims-filing ordinance.\nThe City of Seattle has only so much immunity as it derives from the sovereign. Employco Personnel, 117 Wn.2d at 614-15; Kelso, 63 Wn.2d at 916-17. The natural corollary to this principle is that the City cannot confer additional immunity upon itself which does not exist in the sovereign. Because the State has waived immunity for itself and its political subdivisions by enacting RCW 64.40, Seattle cannot then reimpose partial immunity through its claims-filing ordinance.\nNothing in the plain language of the statute expressly permits a municipality to bar or qualify this statutory cause of action by imposing a claims-filing requirement. The Legislature is presumed to know the theory upon which municipal corporations of the State, including cities, have previously been granted immunity under the existing law. Kelso, 63 Wn.2d at 917. Presumably the Legislature knew that cities still retain the authority to impose a claims-filing requirement under RCW 4.96.010 for damages for tortious conduct. If the Legislature intended to preserve the same claims-filing requirement for causes of action under RCW 64.40.020, then it could have expressly included such a provision in the statute, just as it did in RCW 4.96.010. It did not. As this court stated in Kelso:\nIf [the Legislature] desired to preserve the. doctrine of governmental immunity for these political subdivisions, it should have so stated; and the legislature, not the courts, must find the remedy for their omission.\nKelso, 63 Wn.2d at 917. See also Employco Personnel, 117 Wn.2d at 614-15 (holding Seattle could not confer immunity upon itself for damages from interrupted electric service where the Legislature had declined to grant that immunity). The few appellate decisions to date addressing RCW 64.40-.020 do not indicate the plaintiffs were required to first file a claim before commencing suit under RCW 64.40.020. See, e.g., View Ridge Park Assocs. v. Mountlake Terrace, 67 Wn. App. 588, 839 P.2d 343 (1992), review denied, 121 Wn.2d 1016 (1993); Lutheran Day Care, 119 Wn.2d at 91; Cobb v. Snohomish Cy., 64 Wn. App. 451, 829 P.2d 169 (1991), review denied, 119 Wn.2d 1012 (1992); Ivy Club Investors Ltd. Partnership v. Kennewick, 40 Wn. App. 524, 699 P.2d 782, review denied, 104 Wn.2d 1006 (1985).\nJudicially reading in a qualified immunity not expressly provided by the Legislature would permit the City to potentially defeat causes of action under RCW 64.40.020. Such a result would be inconsistent with the purpose of the statute which is to provide a swift remedy for property damage caused by governmental agency action.\nIll\nWe hold RCW 4.96.010 and RCW 64.40.020 do not authorize Seattle to impose compliance with its ordinance, SMC 5.24.005, as a condition precedent to bringing an action under RCW 64.40.020. Thus, the cause of action created by RCW 64.40.020 is not subject to the claims-filing prerequisite imposed by SMC 5.24.005. We reverse the Superior Court's dismissal of appellants' RCW 64.40.020 cause of action and remand for further proceedings.\nAndersen, C.J., and Utter, Brachtenbach, Dolliver, and Smith, JJ., concur.\nThe Legislature recently amended RCW 4.96.010. Laws of 1993, ch. 449, \u00a7 2. The statute formerly read:\nAll political subdivisions, municipal corporations, and quasi municipal corporations of the state, whether acting in a governmental or proprietary capacity, shall be liable for damages arising out of their tortious conduct, or the tortious conduct of their officers, agents or employees to the same extent as if they were a private person or corporation: PROVIDED, That the filing within the time allowed by law of any claim required shall be a condition precedent to the maintaining of any action. . . .\nFormer RCW 4.96.010. The revision to RCW 4.96.010 does not change the language relevant to the issue in this case regarding liability for damages resulting from tortious conduct.\nIn addition to the above change, the Legislature also amended RCW 4.96 to provide a single, uniform procedure for bringing a claim against a local governmental entity. Laws of 1993, ch. 449, \u00a7 1. Previously, claims-filing procedures were scattered among various statutes. Former RCW 4.96.020(1) provided that former RCW 35.31 would govern the procedure for presenting a claim against charter cities such as Seattle, and former RCW 36.45 would govern claims against counties. Former RCW 4.96.020(2) set out the procedure for other political subdivisions and municipal corporations, and former RCW 35A.31.010-.030 established the procedure for claims against code cities. All of these procedures have been consolidated into"

    "Utter, J.\nThe plaintiffs brought this action to enjoin the construction of a 128-unit, 5-story condominium apartment building on lots 1 through 8, block 52 of Lake Union Shorelands in Seattle. Defendants were Roanoke Reef Associates, the developer, and the City of Seattle and superintendent of buildings thereof, who issued building permits for the Roanoke Reef condominium.\nPlaintiffs make five contentions: (1) the building permit for the condominium was issued in violation of the Seattle building code and zoning ordinances; (2) the grant of the second renewal of the building permit was unlawful as being arbitrary and capricious; (3) the grant of the third renewal of the building permit was unlawful as no environmental impact statement was prepared or issued in accordance with the State Environmental Policy Act of 1971 (SEPA) (RCW 43.21C); (4) the defendant-developer failed to obtain the permit required by the Shoreline Management Act of 1971 (RCW 90.58) prior to undertaking their substantial development; and (5) the building being constructed is an obstruction to navigation. We will discuss these contentions separately.\nAfter a trial involving disputed testimony, the court declined to grant an injunction and entered judgment for the defendants. The court held the issuance of the May 8, 1969 building permit \u201calthough done contrary to the terms of the Building Code\u201d was cured by subsequent compliance with the code requirements, and against the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contentions.\nPlaintiffs on appeal raise the same issues they urged before the trial court. We agree with plaintiffs that the building permit was issued in violation of the Seattle building code, that this irregularity was not cured by subsequent compliance and that, as well, even if the permit issuance was valid, an environmental impact statement was required prior to the third renewal of the building permit.\nIn 1967, defendant purchased lots 1 through 8 in Roanoke Bay of Lake Union, which then contained a boat marina comprising 60 covered boat moorages and a boat sales and repair shop. On June 19, 1967 the defendant applied to the City of Seattle for a building permit to construct a condominium. This application used state-leased submerged lands adjacent to the lots owned by defendant to satisfy the bulk and density requirements under the city zoning ordinance. This lease was not executed to them by the state until March 22,1968.\nOn January 3, 1969 the 1967 application was reintroduced using the earlier application form, apparently to avoid forfeiting the previous plan checking fee. No new drawings or specifications were submitted with this \u201cnew\u201d application as required by Seattle code 3.03.020. On May 7 or 8, 1969 the completed plans required by the code were filed and on May 8, 1969 a building permit (No. 531945) was issued \u201csubject to structural and ordinance check.\u201d Such a conditional permit grant procedure was not and is not provided for by the Seattle code and the trial court concluded the May, 1969 permit was issued contrary to the code\u2019s terms.\nEffective September 5, 1969 the Seattle zoning ordinance was amended to prohibit the use of submerged state-leased lands for computing floor area ratio, dwelling unit ratio and lot coverage. Such lands were so used by defendant in its 1967 and 1969 applications and in the city\u2019s 1969 conditional permit issuance.\nOn April 22, 1970 the first renewal of the 1969 permit was issued for 1 year.\nAnother significant Seattle zoning ordinance amendment became effective on May 30, 1970 which provided that city council approval was required in the construction of an apartment house in a general commercial (CG) zone. The subject area is CG zoned and the condominium here received no such council approval.\nOn October 22, 1970 the superintendent of buildings approved the building plans for the condominium by removing the condition \u201csubject to structural and' ordinance check\u201d on the permit issued May 8, 1969. It was the removal of this condition which finally permitted the defendant, for the first time, to commence construction. Based on extensive and disputed testimony, the trial court found that work did commence on March 15 and 16, 1971 with the demolition of a portion of the moorage improvements on the subject property and the driving of 10 steel pipe piles.\nOn April 19, 1971 the second renewal of the original May 1969 permit was issued for a 6-month period, after the building superintendent determined, pursuant to code requirements, the work authorized had been started and was progressing at an approved rate.\nThe Shoreline Management Act of 1971 became effective on June 1, 1971 and the State Environmental Policy Act of 1971 (SEPA) became effective on August 9,1971.\nOn October 17, 1971 the third renewal of the 1969 permit was issued for 1 year.\nI\nBuilding Permit Issued in Violation of Code and Zoning Ordinances\nThe plaintiffs first contend the trial court erred in holding the defendant has a vested right to develop the property in accordance with the zoning ordinances in effect on January 3,1969, the date of permit application. We agree.\nOur ruling in Hull v. Hunt, 53 Wn.2d 125, 331 P.2d 856 (1958) sets forth this jurisdiction\u2019s rule as to when rights vest with an applicant for a building permit. We there expressly rejected, at page 129, the majority rule which states:\nany substantial change of position, expenditures or in-currence of obligations under a permit entitles the per-mittee to complete the construction and use the premises for the purpose authorized irrespective of subsequent zoning or changes in zoning. ... 8 McQuillin on Municipal Corporations (3d ed. 1949), \u00a7 25.157 at 360.\nIllustrative of jurisdictions which adopt this rule is Virginia, where in Board of Supervisors v. Medical Structures, Inc., 213 Va. 355, 192 S.E.2d 799 (1972), the court held, at page 358:\nwhere, as here, a special use permit has been granted under a zoning classification, a bona fide site plan has thereafter been filed and diligently pursued, and substantial expense has been incurred in good faith before a change in zoning, the permittee then has a vested right to the land use described in the use permit and he cannot be deprived of such use by subsequent legislation.\nWe rejected that approach at page 130 of Hull, where we noted:\nWe prefer not to adopt a rule which forces the court to search through (to quote from State ex rel. Ogden v. Bellevue, supra [45 Wn.2d 492, 275 P.2d 899 (1954)]) \u201cthe moves and countermoves of . . . parties . . . by way of passing ordinances and bringing actions for injunctions\u201d \u2014 to which may be added the stalling or acceleration of administrative action in the issuance of permits \u2014 to find that date upon which the substantial change of position is made which finally vests the right.\nThe rule we adopted is concise and provides for easy application. It is:\n[T]he right vests when the party . . . applies for his building permit, if that permit is thereafter issued. This rule, of course, assumes that the permit applied for and granted be consistent with the zoning ordinances and building codes in force at the time of application for the permit.\nTherefore, no rights may vest where either the application submitted or the permit issued fails to conform to the zoning or building regulations.\nThe Seattle building code sets forth specific and extensive requirements for the orderly and equitable issuance of building permits. 3.03.020. The provisions therein, provide in part, that (a) to obtain a permit an application must be filed and accompanied by drawings and specifications; (b) each application is to have two sets of drawings and specifications; (c) the application and materials filed \u201cshall be checked by the Superintendent of Buildings\u201d; (d) \u201cIf the Superintendent of Buildings is satisfied\u201d that the application and materials conform to the law and a building permit fee has been paid \u201che shall issue a permit therefor to the applicant\u201d; and (e) when a permit has been issued the drawings and specifications are to be marked \u201cApproved\u201d.\nThe record indicates, and the trial court found, that the building permit of May 8, 1969 was issued contrary to these provisions in that the permit grant was made prior to any check of the drawings or specifications. In fact, the grant made was explicitly a conditional permit, which is not authorized by the code.\nWe have held that:\nThe acts of administering a zoning ordinance do not go back to the questions of policy and discretion which were settled at the time of the adoption of the ordinance. Administrative authorities are properly concerned with questions of compliance with the ordinance, not with its wisdom.\n(Italics ours.) State ex rel. Ogden v. Bellevue, 45 Wn.2d 492, 495, 275 P.2d 899 (1954). This rule is of equal force in the administration of a building code. To permit another course of administrative behavior, thereby inviting discretion, may well result in violations of the equal protection of the laws. The code is positive in its requirements and contains no exceptional procedures like those employed here; hence, no city officer was authorized to permit its violation. The duty of those empowered to enforce the codes and ordinances of the city is to insure compliance therewith and not to devise anonymous procedures available to the citizenry in an arbitrary and uncertain fashion.\nThis permit grant violation alone frustrates the vesting of defendant\u2019s rights, but there were also apparent inconsistencies regarding the applications to which no trial court findings were made. The code requires each application to have drawings and specifications submitted at the same time, yet here the \u201creintroduced\u201d application was not accompanied by any new materials. It might be argued that the 2-year-old drawings and specifications from the 1967 application can be deemed to satisfy this code requirement as they remained on file, but this raises the code provision pertaining to retention of drawings which provides:\nDrawings submitted for checking, for which no permit is issued, and on which no action is taken by the applicant for six months, shall be destroyed ... to renew action on said drawings, new drawings and a payment of a new drawing check fee shall be required.\nThe record is clear that no permit was issued on the 1967 application and drawings; however, the record is unclear whether the applicant was idle for any 6-month period between the June 1967 application and the reintroduced January 1969 application. If no action was undertaken by the applicant, it was incumbent upon the building department to destroy the drawings and require new fee, application, and materials in order to renew a permit request.\nSince the permit grant itself was patently impermissible, we need not decide if the application was also defective.\nThe trial court deemed this unlawful permit was immaterial because it was cured by \u201csubsequent compliance\u201d. We decline to accept this validation of an otherwise invalid permit because there is no such curing device in the Seattle building code. Moreover, we must speculate as to what was the \u201csubsequent compliance\u201d, presumably the October 22,1970 removal of the permit\u2019s condition.\nTo the contrary, where a building permit is found to be invalid it is void and confers no rights. Nolan v. Blackwell, 123 Wash. 504, 212 P. 1048 (1923); Hull v. Hunt, 53 Wn.2d 125, 331 P.2d 856 (1958); Steele v. Queen City Broadcasting Co., 54 Wn.2d 402, 341 P.2d 499 (1959). In both Nolan and Steele a primary deficiency in the permit was caused by errors on the part of the property owners, yet the officers and agents of the city were also causes for the unlawfulness of the permit issuance. In Nolan, the permit was issued under an error of fact by the officials. Regardless of the source of the invalidity, be it solely the wrongdoing of the applicant, the administrator, or both, the evil is identical; namely, the disregard of legislation established to further a social good. In Steele, the court found the city had no authority to issue the permit or keep it alive by granting extensions.\nTo ignore these mandatory code requirements is not only improper under the reasoning of Nolan and Steele, but would also seriously undermine, if not demolish, the protections of the rule established in Hull v. Hunt, supra. In the pursuit of certainty in the date of vesting of rights, we recognized our rule in Hull might invite speculation in building permits, but felt two factors diminished this possibility. First, a 180-day time limitation existed under the Seattle code within which construction must commence or a permit would become null and void. Second, the cost of preparing plans and meeting the requirements of building codes is such that good faith application can be assumed. The first factor is no longer the law in the Seattle code and so we must rely solely upon the burdens of meeting the pertinent building code requirements as the device for insuring the proper exercise of the Hull rule. Ignoring the violations here removes the code\u2019s burdens, inviting speculation.\nThe defendant urges us to look away from these code violations and provide equitable relief but fails to cite any legal or equitable principles to support the claim. This arbitrary approach must be avoided and we should not excuse the application of established codes and ordinances. Equitable relief is usually only appropriate where there are two private parties in dispute within a contractual or propertied relationship. This is not the case here. Finch v. Matthews, 74 Wn.2d 161, 443 P.2d 833 (1968).\nWe cannot find that a litigant has any right to be a beneficiary of unlawful administrative conduct where the public\u2019s interest will suffer, by the mere assertion that extensive financial investment is in the balance. Defendant started the project with full awareness that there were multiple, serious legal obstacles and cannot now claim relief simply because money was expended in the face of an awareness it might not have a legal right to proceed.\nWe have not been persuaded in the past that because a financial investment is in jeopardy, the public interest should suffer. Wilbour v. Gallagher, 77 Wn.2d 306, 462 P.2d 232, 40 A.L.R.3d 760 (1969) and Bach v. Sarich, 74 Wn.2d 575, 445 P.2d 648 (1968).\nIn Bach, at page 581, we recognized that \u201c[fjrom the very commencement of defendants\u2019 construction they were aware of the protests of other riparian owners. The encroaching structure did not exist at the time of suit, but was built during the pendency of this suit.\u201d In that case we refused to consider equitable relief premised upon the money expended during litigation.\nLitigation here commenced with the filing of complaints on September 20, 1971, yet the developers assert on appeal that construction continues. Factually, in the instant case we are faced, at the time litigation commenced, with construction no further advanced than the fill, concrete slab and pilings in Bach.\nThe issue of whether defendant can comply with the now existing laws is not before us, nor is the question of what is to be done with the existing construction.\n\u201cEquity came to fulfil the law, not to destroy it\u201d and we fail to see how the legal principles here at issue are fulfilled by excusing their application. L. Curzon, Equity 6 (1967).\nAnother reason exists to reject the theory that the May 1969 permit is unlawful, yet made valid by the October 1970 approval. If the 1969 permit is invalid, what is to be made of the permit renewals of April 1970, April 1971 and October 1971? It is nonsensical to argue that one can have a valid renewal of an invalid permit and the subsequent renewals of that invalid permit are also improper. If the October 1970 approval, by removing the condition on the permit is deemed an independent and lawful \u201cpermission\u201d to construct, there still have been no renewals triggered by that approval and based on that date because no one looked at that action as establishing a valid, lawful permit as of that date. No consistent argument can be made for the vesting of rights on an invalid permit allegedly cured by a subsequent event under a code which does not allow for any such curing.\nII\nSecond Renewal of the Building Permit Was Not Unlawful as Being Arbitrary and Capricious\nAssuming the second and third renewals of the May 1969' building permit are valid, we turn to a consideration of the issues raised in relation to them. The plaintiffs contend that the building superintendent acted arbitrarily and capriciously in granting the second renewal permit. We disagree.\nArbitrary and capricious administrative action is defined as:\n[B]eing willful and unreasoning action, without consideration and in disregard of facts or circumstances . . . where there is room for two opinions, action is not arbitrary and capricious when exercised honestly and upon due consideration, even though it may be otherwise felt that a different conclusion might be reached.\nBishop v. Houghton, 69 Wn.2d 786, 794, 420 P.2d 368 (1966). The discretion to which the abuse is asserted is authorized by Seattle code 3.03.020 (h) which provides that renewed permits after the initial renewal may be granted \u201cprovided that the work permitted has been started and is progressing at a rate approved by the superintendent of buildings.\u201d\nThe trial court found no abuse of discretion and the record supports such a finding. The record indicates considerable deliberation and time in coming to a decision. The investigation entailed a report from the superintendent\u2019s chief inspector, photographs taken of the site by a department inspector, the inspector\u2019s filed report, a visitation to the site by the superintendent of buildings, a meeting with the developer, information obtained indicating adequate and proper project financing, and information that purchase orders for materials had been released. Though there may be room for debate as to whether the work had sufficiently progressed under the circumstances to justify the granting of the second renewal, where the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence, we will not overturn them. Croton Chem. Corp. v. Birkenwald, 50 Wn.2d 684, 314 P.2d 622 (1957); Stringfellow v. Stringfel-low, 56 Wn.2d 957, 350 P.2d 1003, 353 P.2d 671 (1960), and cases cited therein; Sheldon v. Hallis, 72 Wn.2d 993, 435 P.2d 988 (1967).\nIll\nThird Renewal of the Building Permit Was Unlawful as no Environmental Impact Statement Was Prepared\nor Issued\nIt is also contended that the superintendent of buildings failed in his duty in regard to the third renewal by neglecting to file an environmental impact statement pursuant to SEPA, RCW 43.21C. We agree.\nThe settled law regarding application of environmental protection acts to the facts in this case requires that we find the city should have commenced environmental evaluation of the project\u2019s impact prior to the third renewal. Calvert Cliffs' Coordinating Comm., Inc. v. United States Atomic Energy Comm\u2019n, 449 F.2d 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1971); Named Individual Members of San Antonio Conservation Soc\u2019y v. Texas Highway Dep\u2019t, 446 F.2d 1013 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 932, 29 L. Ed. 2d 711, 91 S. Ct. 2257 (1971); Arlington Coalition on Transp. v. Volpe, 458 F.2d 1323 (4th Cir. 1972); Note, 39 Tenn. L. Rev. 735 (1972).\nTo do otherwise would be to not only ignore precedents already established but to also ignore the unusually vigorous statement of legislative purpose contained in this act to consider the total environmental and ecological factors to the fullest in deciding major matters.\nThe particular question raised by the assertion that SEPA embraces the Roanoke Reef project is whether the decision by the building department to issue a third renewal permit for such a project constitutes a major action significantly affecting the quality of the environment so as to require a detailed environmental impact statement.

    "Hale, J.\nWhen the Bjorvatns bought their house on Sand Point Way Northeast in Seattle in 1962, they knew it had been badly damaged by a sinking of the land. They did not expect, however, that, years after they had repaired and restored the house, the construction of a sewer nearby would produce a similar damage. They bring this action against the Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle and the sewer contractor for injuries to their house and land.\nOddmund Bjorvatn looked over the property at 9509 Sand Point Way Northeast carefully before he bought it in 1962. He saw that the land beneath the house had settled through the years producing cracks in the basement and house walls and causing the basement and house floors to slope and the fireplace to separate from the wall. In one place, he observed that the basement floor had sheared off and had been repoured to floor level. Despite its damaged condition, Bjorvatn decided to buy the house and restore it.\nIn the present case, the trial court had to determine the cause and nature of the original settling. It found that the house, built in 1946 or 1947, had settled because of the compressible character of the soils on which it stood, but that the settling process, although persisting through the years, had ended by 1960. Thus, by the time the Bjorvatns bought the property in May, 1962, the settling had ended, and the lot and subsoil were then stable and in a state of equilibrium although the soil retained its compressible character. The court in its findings characterized this phenomenon as a delicate state of equilibrium because \u201cit was resting upon compressible soils.\u201d\nBetween May, 1962, and the end of 1963, Mr. Bjorvatn made the house level, installed a new fireplace, filled and repaired all cracks, and hauled in fill material for and built a new patio at the rear of the house. In doing this work, he utilized the old footings for the building, fireplace and chimney. In October, 1964, after the Bjorvatns had completely restored the house and were living in it, defendant Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle \u2014 commonly called Metro \u2014 began construction of a trunk sewer in Metro\u2019s property adjoining on the north -and in a Seattle right-of-way adjoining Bjorvatns\u2019 on the east. The trench was unusually deep, running to a maximum depth of 36 feet in both these areas to the north and east of the Bjorvatns\u2019 property.\nDuring the excavation and filling operation, the defendants operated on the sewer site heavy earth moving and digging machinery which produced considerable vibration. The court found, however, that the 36-foot deep sewer trench was below the level of the subterranean ground water table; that digging the sewer trench caused a lowering of the water table and increased, as the engineers describe it, the effective load upon compressible soils supporting Bjorvatns\u2019 foundation; and that these forces were a proximate cause of the Bjorvatns\u2019 house settling anew. It is clear from a reading of this record that the trial court was convinced and found that a combination of forces, i.e., heavy machinery, vibration, 'and a deep trench, which deprived the Bjorvatns\u2019 compressible subsoil of its natural water content, all combined to produce a sinking of the Bjorvatns\u2019 foundation and the consequent damage. By April, 1965, defendants had finished excavating and completely refilled the sewer trench in the vicinity of the Bjorvatns, leaving their house in a damaged condition. The fireplace was cracked and the chimney pulled away from the wall. The excavating and refilling also cracked the concrete foundation walls, put cracks in the plaster, and unleveled the floors.\nDeeming this a damaging of private property by a condemnor for public use without just compensation under the ninth amendment to the state constitution, the court granted plaintiffs judgment in the amount of $5,000. Defendants contend that this was not a damaging of property for the public use, but rather a rightful impeding or obstructing of the flow of subterranean waters. They rely largely on the rationale of Evans v. Seattle, 182 Wash. 450, 47 P.2d 984 (1935), in which opening a ditch in a gravel pit drained away an underground spring and streams that supplied water to adjoining property owners. There, plaintiffs brought an action to recover for the total loss of underground percolating waters, but this court, holding the loss to be damnum absque injuria, denied recovery. See, also, to that effect, Wilkening v. State, 54 Wn.2d 692, 344 P.2d 204 (1959).\nWe adhere to these principles and recognize that as a general rule loss or inconvenience caused by interference with the natural movement of percolating waters which results from lawful and proper uses of, or operations upon, the containing land is damnum absque injuria unless liability has been created by statute. 56 Am. Jur. Waters \u00a7 120 (1947). But it should be observed that this rule applies only under circumstances where damage results from no more than a rightful appropriation or diversion of the percolating waters.\nThe freedom to interfere with percolating waters in the lawful and reasonable use of one\u2019s property was recently sustained but deemed inapplicable in State v. Ponten, 77 Wn.2d 463, 463 P.2d 150 (1969). We there held that the state, as condemnor, was not simply a landowner making a proper and reasonable use of its land when, in building a highway, it diverted and disposed of percolating waters to the damage of nearby owners. We said:\nIf the state were just another property owner making proper and reasonable use of its own property, and if that use occasioned a diversion of percolating water on nearby property, it would be damnum absque injuria, and the trial court should be affirmed.\nThe state, in Ponten, was not appropriating the water as a landowner in the usual or customary sense but rather in the exercise of eminent domain, diverting it for what the law would deem an entirely artificial use of the land; and the loss of water to nearby landowners in our opinion amounted to a damaging of their property compensable under the constitution. But, unlike the instant case, Ponten depended not upon damage produced by removal of lateral or subjacent support, but instead on the idea that the state, in constructing a freeway, made a wholly artificial use of the land for a public use without just compensation having first been made \u2014 in violation of Const, art. 1, \u00a7 16. We held in Ponten that, since a damage had been imposed in the exercise of the constitutional power of eminent domain, the rule of negligence did not intrude; and that if a damaging to real property proximately results from the exercise of that power, it is compensable under the constitution no matter how great the care exercised by the condemnor.\nAn owner in exercising his right to control, manage and improve his land, may take lawful and reasonable action to protect it from surface waters flowing from higher land and the damages caused thereby are deemed damnum absque injuria. Wilkening v. State, supra. But that rule has little application to the circumstances of the present case; Metro was not fighting off surface and percolating waters and impeding their flow upon its land as was the situation in Wilkening. Even though plaintiffs here might have proved that Metro and the contractor were negligent in producing excessive vibration, or in keeping the ditch open for an unnecessarily long period, or in covering and reopening it several times, their entitlement to recovery did not depend upon such proof. Plaintiffs\u2019 right to recovery here rested not on concepts of negligence but on proving that Metro, as condemn or, in exercising the power of eminent domain for construction of a sewer in adjoining property, inflicted a physical injury, directly and proximately causing damage to the plaintiffs\u2019 real property and improvements.\nRemoval of lateral or subjacent support from adjoining property in the digging of a sewer ditch is a damaging under Const, art. 1, \u00a7 16. Whether the damage resulted from a drying out process, a lowering of the water table, a release of physical pressure, or a combination of these and other physical forces, the fact remains that the defendants were not making an appropriation of percolating waters for their own use. They were digging a deep ditch for a public use in property adjoining that of the Bjorvatns and in doing so removed lateral and subjacent supports causing damage. The removal of lateral and subjacent support from adjoining property in the construction of a sewer for a municipality or subdivision of the state is, in our opinion, a damaging of property for a public use for which the condemnor must make just compensation.\nWe think that this rule accords with our statement in Muskatell v. Seattle, 10 Wn.2d 221, 116 P.2d 363 (1941), at 235:\nAll that appellant was required to plead and prove was that the city, in the construction of its sewer, removed the lateral support of appellant\u2019s property, thereby causing sand, silt, or water to be forced out from under appellant\u2019s building, directly causing the damage to the building complained of.\nThe condemnor is liable for damages caused by the removal of lateral and subjacent support, and it is immaterial whether the loss of support has been produced by drainage, release of pressures and weight, or drawing off or lowering of percolating waters or other forces, so long as the digging of the ditch is shown to have been the direct and proximate cause of the removal. We said this in Muskatell, as follows, at 237:\nWhatever the general rule may be in regard to percolating waters, we are of the opinion that, under our constitutional provision, for an action brought for the removal of lateral support, there is and should be no distinction whether, by the removal of the lateral support, sand, silt, quicksand, or water is removed from under the land of the adjoining property owner, directly causing the damage for which complaint is made.\nAccord: Farnandis v. Great Northern Ry., 41 Wash. 486, 84 P. 18 (1906). The removal of lateral or subjacent support is an actionable damage. Knapp v. Siegley, 120 Wash. 478, 208 P. 13 (1922); Peters v. Bellingham Coal Mines, 173 Wash. 123, 21 P.2d 1024 (1933).\nAffirmed.\nHunter, C. J., Finley, Rosellini, Hamilton, and McGovern, JJ., concur."

    "Schwellenbach, J.\nApril 27, 1949, Mon Wai and wife leased certain real property in Yakima to Parks and Watkins for a term of ten years, beginning not later than July 1,1949, at an agreed rental of $405 per month, payable in advance, on or before the first day of each month. The pertinent provisions of the lease agreement are as follows:\n\u201cWhereas, the parties hereto desire to enter into an agreement whereby the parties of the first part will construct upon the above-described premises a parking lot and service station building, the parties jointly sharing the cost of said construction; and\n\u201cWhereas, the parties hereto desire to enter into an agreement for the construction of said property and the leasing of said building and premises; Now, Therefore,\n\u201cIt is agreed and understood that in consideration of the covenants herein contained and the payments of rental hereinafter provided, that the Lessors do hereby agree to construct upon the above-described real property a hard-surface asphalt parking lot to be enclosed by a six-foot cyclone fence \u00bfnd a concrete bumper curb of the full area, except around the entrance and service station. And in addition thereto Lessors will construct a concrete-block building and other installations which are evidenced by blue print attached to this agreement, signed by the parties hereto and made a part hereof by reference.\n\u201cLessees have as of this date delivered to Lessors the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00), receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, which Lessees agree shall be applied to the cost of the construction of said parking lot; all the remaining cost and expense thereof shall be borne by Lessors, except that Lessees shall furnish and pay for the cost of installing gasoline tanks, pumps and any and all other facilities as they shall desire upon said premises. . . .\n\u201cIt is agreed and understood that at the termination of this. lease any and all improvements placed upon said premises shall remain thereon and shall be the property of Lessors, except that Lessees shall have the right to remove any gas pumps placed upon said premises and shall have the right to remove any fixtures or equipment together with any stock of goods and supplies placed thereon by Lessees, except the gas tanks, which may be remov\u00e9d without in any way damaging or injuring said premises. . . .\n\u201cIt is agreed and understood that in the event Lessees shall fail, neglect or refuse to pay the rentals herein reserved and in the manner herein set forth, time being declared to be the essence of this agreement; or in the event Lessees shall fail in any other respect to carry out the terms and conditions of this agreement; . . . Lessors shall have the option to forfeit and terminate this lease and recover possession of the premises herein demised in the manner and form provided by the laws of the State of Washington now or hereafter to go into effect, but Lessors shall give thirty (30) days notice in writing of their intention to forfeit said lease, which notice may be made either personally on either of the above-named Lessees, or may be made by depositing the same in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Lessees, or either of them at the above-described premises, and all moneys paid by Lessees to Lessors shall be forfeited as liquidated damages to Lessors.\n\u201cThe above remedies in the case of the failure, to pay rent or to perform the covenants of this contract are cumulative and shall not deprive Lessees of the right to use any statutory remedies available to them. . . .\n\u201cIn the event suit or action is instituted to enforce any of the terms or conditions of this agreement, or to regain possession of the same or any part thereof, the prevailing party in such suit or action shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to be determined by the court.- . . . \u201d (Italics ours.)\nThe lessees took possession July 1,1949.\nJuly 22, 1949, Parks sold his interest to Watkins. By the terms of a written instrument executed by the parties, Watkins assumed and agreed to pay, and in all particulars to perform, the rentals, terms and conditions of the Mon Wai lease.\nWatkins continued in possession and paid the rentals up to September 1,1951. However, he did not pay the rentals due September 1, 1951, October 1, 1951, and November 1, 1951.\nNovember 5, 1951, Mon Wai served notice on Parks and Watkins that they had failed to make the three payments above mentioned, in the total amount of $1,215, and notified them that unless the payments were brought to date within thirty days the lease would be forfeited and terminated.\nNovember 7, 1951, Parks and Watkins surrendered the property to Mon Wai, and delivered possession and the keys to him.\nMarch 7, 1952, Mon Wai and wife commenced this action against Parks and Watkins for the unpaid rent. Parks answered, setting up the agreement between himself and Watkins and praying that, in the event judgment be entered against him, he have and recover judgment over against Watkins in the full amount, together with an attorney\u2019s fee of $150. Watkins answered, alleging that the lease was terminated and rescinded prior to the institution of the action and that there was no valid and binding agreement in existence at that time.\nThe trial court entered judgment against Parks and Watkins, and each of them, in the amount of $1,215, plus interest and costs, and an attorney\u2019s fee of $250. The court also, as part of the same judgment, awarded judgment in the amount of $1,465 to Parks over and against Watkins, together with an attorney\u2019s fee of $150. Watkins alone is appealing.\nAppellant assigns error in the making of certain findings of fact; in awarding judgment against Parks and Watkins; in awarding judgment over to Parks; and in allowing attorney\u2019s fees to Parks.\nUnless there is a stipulation in the lease agreement providing for liquidated damages in case of default, upon forfeiture of a lease for failure to pay rent the lessor may recover all rent due at the time the forfeiture was declared. Kelley v. von Herberg, 184 Wash. 165, 50 P. (2d) 23.\nWe have held that, where a certain sum is paid to the lessor by the lessee to be held until the end of the term, and it is agreed between the parties that, either in the event of nonpayment of rent payable at the times specified or of default of any of the covenants contained in the lease, the lessor may cancel the lease and the sum paid to the lessor shall be forfeited as liquidated damages, such agreement is binding provided the amount agreed upon as liquidated damages is reasonable. Smith v. Lambert Transfer Co., 109 Wash. 529, 187 Pac. 362; Pacific & Puget Sound Bottling Co. v. Clithero, 162 Wash. 156, 298 Pac. 316; Benjamin Franklin Thrift Stores v. Jared, 192 Wash. 252, 73 P. (2d) 525.\nThere is no difference, so far as damages are .concerned, between a breach of a covenant to pay rent and a breach of any other covenant in the lease. In Pacific & Puget Sound Bottling Co. v. Clithero, supra, we said:\n\u201cThe first paragraph of the lease above quoted provides that in consideration of the sum of two thousand dollars and the performance of the other covenants by the lessee, the premises are leased and demised.- In the last paragraph quoted, the two thousand dollars first m\u00e9ntioned is specifically referred to as having been deposited as liquidated damages. It is there said that the two thousand dollars so deposited shall be forfeited as liquidated damages on account of the \u2018breach or default\u2019 of the lessee. The question then arises whether the breach and default there referred to includes a breach or default in the covenant to pay rent.\n\u201cThe clause in the fore part of the sentence, \u2018if the rent shall be due and unpaid,\u2019 bears exactly the same relation to the latter part of the sentence covering liquidated damages on account of breach or default as does the clause, \u2018 (if) default shall be made in any of the conditions or. covenants herein contained.\u2019 If the liquidated damages specified covers one clause, it would seem to necessarily follow that it covers the other. While it is true that the two thousand dollars, when first mentioned in the lease, was referred to as a consideration therefor, its status as liquidated damages was definitely fixed in the last paragraph.\u201d\nEven though no money has been deposited, if the parties to a contract stipulate that, in the event of a breach, one of the parties shall pay to the other a specific sum as stipulated damages, such an agreement is valid, the theory being that the parties have agreed, or have stipulated, as to the amount of damage. Herberger v. Orr Co., 62 Wash. 526, 114 Pac. 178. In each instance, the intention of the parties is controlling. 52 C.J.S. 213, Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 472 b.\n2 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, 2023 (3rd Rev.), defines liquidated damages:\n\u201cDamages the amount of which has been determined by anticipatory agreement between the parties.\n\u201cDamages for a specific sum stipulated or agreed upon as part of a contract, as the amount to be paid to a party who alleges and proves a breach of it.\u201d\nIt will thus be seen that, where liquidated damages are provided for, a particular amount has been agreed upon between the parties to be paid in case of a breach. Ordinarily in lease agreements the lessee has paid a certain sum to the lessor, and that particular sum is earmarked as the amount to be retained in the event of a default by the lessee. However, in executory contracts for the sale of real property, it is often provided that, in case of default, the seller may forfeit the contract and retain, as liquidated damages, all sums theretofore paid by the purchaser.\nCounsel have not furnished us, nor has our search revealed, a case such as this, wherein the lease agreement provided, \u201cand all moneys paid by Lessees to Lessors shall be forfeited as liquidated damages to Lessors.\u201d Appellant insists that the above clause must have referred to the $5,000 paid at the time of the execution of the lease. We are satisfied that the $5,000 was the lessees\u2019 contribution to the cost of the construction of the parking lot, the cost of which was to be shared jointly by the parties.\nAlthough, as stated above, we have found no case holding that \u201call moneys paid by Lessees shall be forfeited as liquidated damages,\u201d we see no reason why the parties may not so contract if they desire to do so. When the parties to this lease agreement contracted, the lessees contributed $5,000 as their share of the cost of the construction of the parking lot. At the expiration of the term, which was to run ten years, the improvements would belong to the lessor. No testimony was given as to the intention of the parties, and that intention must be gained from the language which they themselves used.\nIt could very well be that the parties, realizing that the lessees were contributing $5,000 toward the construction of a service station which they were to occupy for ten years and which would then belong to the lessor, considered the fact that at some time during the term of the lease (here it was two and one-half years), lessees might default, thus giving the lessor the right to terminate the lease. It would be a fair interpretation of the agreement that the parties stipulated that, in such an event, considering the fact that the time of the full ownership of the property in the lessor would thus be accelerated, the only damages to which the l\u00e9ssor would be entitled because of the default of the lessees, would be the moneys which they had already paid to him.\nCounsel for respondents stated, in oral argument at the Departmental hearing, that the liquidated damage provision was merely \u201cthrown in\u201d in order to be overly cautious. At the En Banc hearing he stated that the including of that provision was inadvertent and was therefore superfluous. Nevertheless, it is there, and respondents are bound by it. It should be noted that the provisions in the lease concerning forfeiture and liquidated damages are both included in one paragraph, consisting of one sentence. There is no question but that the lease was drawn by respondents\u2019 counsel. Where a lease is capable of more than one construction, the courts will adopt that construction most favorable to the lessee. Anderson v. Ferguson, 17 Wn. (2d) 262, 135 P. (2d) 302, and cases cited. See, also, Dorsey v. Strand, 21 Wn. (2d) 217, 150 P. (2d) 702.\nWe are of the opinion that the parties, by agreement, limited respondents\u2019 damages, in case of their termination of the lease and recovery of possession because of the failure of the lessees to pay the rentals when due, to the moneys theretofore paid by lessees to respondents.\nParks is not appealing the judgment against him. Subsequent to the entry of the judgment, and after Watkins\u2019 appeal had been commenced, respondents executed on sufficient of Parks\u2019 property to cover the full amount of the judgment, plus interest, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees. They then satisfied of record the judgment against Parks and Watkins. Respondents move this court to dismiss the appeal because the question is now moot, relying upon National School Studios v. Superior School Photo Service, 40 Wn. (2d) 263, 242 P. (2d) 756; Pacific Savings & Loan Ass\u2019n v. Smith, 121 Wash. 595, 209 Pac. 1086, 212 Pac. 582; Lewis-Pacific Dairymen\u2019s Ass\u2019n v. Frame, 126 Wash. 493, 218 Pac. 385. Those cases are not in point as to the issues now before us. Neither is RCW 4.88.040, relied upon by respondent. The motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.\nThe judgment appealed from is reversed.\nMallery, Hamley, Donworth, and Finley, JJ., concur."

    "Stafford, J.\nWe are asked to decide the constitutionality of Seattle City Ordinance 109280 (codified as Seattle Municipal Code ch. 7.20) which regulates the eviction of floating homes from their moorages and establishes a procedure for the review and regulation of moorage fee increases. We find the ordinance constitutional on its face and in so ruling affirm the judgment of the trial court.\nOrdinance 109280 took effect on August 22, 1980. Essentially, it repeals ordinance 107012 (the moorage rent control ordinance at issue in Kennedy v. Seattle, 94 Wn.2d 376, 617 P.2d 713 (1980)).\nUnder section 5(1) of ordinance 109280, floating homeowners subject to a moorage fee increase may file a petition for factfinding with a hearing examiner if they believe the increase is unreasonable. Under section 5(2), however, moorage owners are permitted to increase their fees without a hearing if the increase does not exceed either their proportional share of increased property taxes and other designated \"expenses\" or the \"CPI factor\" (Consumer Price Index factor), whichever is greater. All rent increases in effect in July 1979 are subject to the provisions of ordinance 109280.\nAs originally enacted, section 5(3) defined the \"CPI factor\" as follows:\nThe CPI factor for a floating home moorage shall be determined by multiplying the percentage increase in the CPI since the last moorage fee increase by the current moorage fee, and by multiplying the product thereof by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of square feet of land at the subject moorage owned by the moorage owner and the denominator of which shall be the total number of square feet of land in the moorage (privately owned land plus leased land). Floating home owners may petition for a fact-finding whenever a proposed moorage fee increase exceeds the moorage owner's actual increase in operating expenses as listed above or the CPI factor described above, whichever is greater.\nOrdinance 109280, \u00a7 5(3).\nOrdinance 109986, effective July 7, 1981, amended the definition of the CPI factor. The amendment changed the numerator employed in the fraction to exclude land leased from the government. Thus, according to the new definition moorage owners who either lease from the State or use an adjacent street may only raise their rent by the percentage of the CPI factor increase attributable solely to privately owned or leased land. In contrast, moorage owners who either own all of their moorage land or lease it from private parties may increase their rent in proportion to the increase in the CPI factor attributable to their total land.\nIn May of 1979, 1980, and 1981, appellant Gordon Jeffery, an owner and operator of moorage property on Lake Union in Seattle, announced rent increases effective July of 1979, 1980, and 1981. Jeffery's tenants filed petitions for factfinding challenging all three rent increases. Thereafter, Jeffery petitioned the superior court for a writ of prohibition to restrain Leroy McCullough, hearing examiner in the factfinding hearings and respondent herein, from proceeding with the hearings. The parties stipulated the floating homeowners affected by the rent increases could intervene in the superior court action. A show cause hearing was held and the Superior Court denied the petition. (Jeffery v. McCullough, cause 47969-1.)\nThe partnership of Freeman, Gibson and Jeffery (hereinafter Freeman), also an owner and operator of moorage property on Lake Union, announced rent increases effective November 1979 and July 1981. In response, the tenants filed petitions for factfinding challenging each rent increase pursuant to ordinance 109280. Freeman also filed a petition for writ of prohibition against hearing examiner McCullough. The petition was denied. (Freeman v. McCullough, cause 48153-9.)\nBoth Jeffery and Freeman appealed the denial of the writ on the grounds that the ordinance is violative of equal protection and due process. The two causes were consolidated for direct review.\nAppellants contend the distinction made between moor-age owners who own their land or lease it from private individuals and those who lease from the government violates equal protection. It is urged that the disparate treatment is discriminatory and is not rationally related to the legitimate purpose of the ordinance.\nSince this controversy involves neither a suspect class nor a fundamental right, we need only examine the ordinance with minimal scrutiny. Nielsen v. Washington State Bar Ass'n, 90 Wn.2d 818, 820, 585 P.2d 1191 (1978); Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Washington Life & Disab. Ins. Guar. Ass'n, 83 Wn.2d 523, 528, 520 P.2d 162 (1974). Moreover, the ordinance is presumed constitutional, and the party challenging the classification has the heavy burden of overcoming the presumption of its constitutionality. Yakima Cy. Deputy Sheriff's Ass\u2019n v. Board of Comm'rs, 92 Wn.2d 831, 835, 601 P.2d 936 (1979).\nWhen measuring the constitutionality of a legislative classification under minimal scrutiny standards, we must decide: (1) whether the classification applies alike to all members within the designated class; (2) whether there is some basis in reality for reasonably distinguishing between those within and those without the class; and (3) whether the challenged classification has any rational relationship to the purposes of the challenged statute. Yakima Cy. Deputy Sheriff's Ass'n, at 835-36.\nAll three prongs of the minimal scrutiny test have been satisfied. First, all members within each designated class (i.e., the class of moorage owners who do not lease public land, and the class of moorage owners who do lease public land) are treated equally within their respective classes. As to the second prong, there is some basis in reality for the distinction between the classes of moorage owners. The record contains evidence indicating that moorage owners who lease public property have a much lower overhead than those who own the property outright. Thus, the need for rent increases by moorage owners who lease public property is not the same as the need of moorage operators who do not lease public land.\nFinally, the challenged classification is rationally related to the ordinance's stated purpose of preventing evictions through arbitrary action or unreasonable rent increases. It subjects those increases in excess of the CPI factor to a factfinding hearing to determine the reasonableness of the increase. Pursuant to these hearings, a hearing examiner determines whether the \"moorage fee increase is necessary to assure a fair and reasonable return to the moorage owner.\" Ordinance 109280, \u00a7 6. Thus, the ordinance does not put a ceiling on rent increases; it merely requires a hearing for those increases exceeding the CPI factor.\nAppellants next contend section 5(3) of Seattle City Ordinance 109280, as amended by ordinance 109986, deprives them of their property without due process of law and without just compensation. See U.S. Const, amend. 14 and Const, art. 1, \u00a7 3, \u00a7 16 (amendment 9). In order to withstand such a constitutional challenge, the regulation must be reasonable and not unnecessarily prohibitory or confiscatory. See Kennedy v. Seattle, 94 Wn.2d 376, 617 P.2d 713 (1980). We must balance \"the public interest in regulating the use of private property against the interests of private landowners not to be encumbered by restrictions on the use of their property.\" Kennedy, at 384, quoting from Maple Leaf Investors, Inc. v. Department of Ecology, 88 Wn.2d 726, 731, 565 P.2d 1162 (1977).\nIn Kennedy, we upheld all but one of the rent control provisions of ordinance 107012, predecessor to the rent control provision at issue, as a valid exercise of the City's police power. In so ruling, we found that a valid public purpose was involved; that the regulation was substantially related to the evil sought to be cured; and that the rates set were reasonable and not unnecessarily prohibitory or' confiscatory. Kennedy, at 381-83. More is not required, for we \"will not examine the motives of the legislative body; [we] will not r\u00e9quire factual justification for the legislation if it can reasonably be presumed; and [we] will not weigh the wisdom of the particular legislation enacted.\" Kennedy, at 381, quoting from Petstel, Inc. v. County of King, 77 Wn.2d 144, 155, 459 P.2d 937 (1969).\nOur reasons for upholding the rent control provisions at issue in Kennedy are equally applicable to the provisions at issue in the instant case. As in Kennedy, we have legislation designed both to regulate the eviction of floating homes from their moorages and to ensure moorage owners of a reasonable return for their investment. Moreover, the ordinance is substantially similar to the one approved of in Kennedy. Since the purpose behind the legislation is legitimate, its method is rationally related to its purpose, and it is not unduly confiscatory, we find neither a due process violation nor an unlawful taking.\nIn sum, we hold ordinance 109280, as amended by ordinance 109986, constitutional on its face and affirm the trial court's denial of appellants' writs of prohibition. Because of our ruling today, we need not address appellants' other claims.\nIt is so ordered.\nBrachtenbach, C.J., and Rosellini, Utter, Dolliver, Williams, Dore, Dimmick, and Pearson, JJ., concur.\nReconsideration denied December 3, 1982.\nThe following explanation found in Brief of Respondent/Intervenor at pages 7-8 is illustrative of how the CPI factor works. \"If one assumes the existence of a moorage located entirely over privately owned land at which the monthly moorage fee is $100 per month, and also assumes that the percentage increase in the CPI since the last moorage fee increase has been 12%, the moorage fee could be raised by an amount up to $12 per month without being subjected to a fact-finding. [(12% x $100) x 100/100 = $12.] This rule would apply no matter how 'unreasonable' the original $100 per month fee and/or the demanded increase might have been. However, if one assumes the existence of a moorage which comprises 50% privately owned land and 50% land leased from the state or used by virtue of a city street use permit, then the moorage operator could only get an automatic, nonreviewable increase (assuming a $100 per month fee and a 12% CPI increase) of $6 per month. If the moorage owner demanded an increase in an amount greater than $6 per month, the increase (and the underlying fee) would be reviewable. [(12% x $100) x 50/100 = $6.]\"\nWithout passing upon the validity or invalidity of the decision, we note that the Court of Appeals recently upheld the rent increase for 1979. See Jeffery v. Weintraub, 32 Wn. App. 536, 648 P.2d 914 (1982).\nJeffery and appellant Freeman have since sent their tenants notices slightly reducing the rent increases so as to conform to the Consumer Price Index for All Items, All Urban Consumers, Seattle, Washington (CPI-U) for November 1977 to July 1981.\nWe deemed section 2 of ordinance 107012 (which made it unlawful for a moorage owner to give notice or evict a houseboat unless one of six conditions was present) unconstitutional as the limitations were so restrictive as to constitute an unlawful taking."
