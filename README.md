# GraphRAG Solution Accelerator for Azure Database for PostgreSQL
This solution accelerator is designed as an end-to-end example of a Legal Research Copilot application. It demonstrates the implementation of three information retrieval techniques: vector search, semantic ranking, and GraphRAG on Azure Database for PostgreSQL, and illustrates how they can be combined to deliver high quality responses to legal research questions. The app uses the U.S. Case Law dataset of 0.5 million legal cases as a source of the factual data. For more details on these concepts, [please see the accompanying blog to this solution accelerator here](https://aka.ms/pg-graphrag).

## Solution Accelerator Concepts

As the architecture diagram shows, this solution accelerator brings together **vector search, semantic ranking, and GraphRAG**. Here are some highlights, including the information retrieval pipeline:

<details>
  <summary><b>Semantic Ranking</b></summary>
    Enhances vector search accuracy by re-ranking results with a semantic ranker model, significantly improving top results' relevance (e.g., up to a 10–20% boost in NDCG@10 accuracy). The semantic ranker is available as a standalone solution accelerator, detailed in the blog: Introducing Semantic Ranker Solution Accelerator for Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>GraphRAG</b></summary>
    An advanced RAG technique proposed by Microsoft Research to improve quality of RAG system responses by extracting knowledge graph from the source data and leveraging it to provide better context to the LLM. The GraphRAG technique consists of three high level steps:
    1. Graph extraction 
    2. Entity summarization 
    3. Graph query generation at query time 
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Information Retrieval Pipeline</b></summary>
    We leverage the structure of the citation graph at the query time by using specialized graph query. The graph query is designed to use the prominence of the legal cases as a signal to improve the accuracy of the information retrieval pipeline. The graph query is expressed as a mixture of traditional relational query and OpenCypher graph query and executed on Postgres using the Apache AGE extension. The resulting information retrieval pipeline is shown below.

## Deployment and Development
The steps below guides you to deploy the Azure services necessary for this solution accelerator into your Azure subscription.

### Prerequisite Steps for Semantic Ranking ML Endpoint

⚠️ **NOTE:** In order to run the Semantic Ranking part of this accelerator, it requires you have an Azure ML Endpoint running a ranking model such as “bge-reranker-v2-m3”.  As a way to get this up and running, you can deploy following related solution accelerator which will setup an Azure ML Endpoint for ranking scoring:

- [Semantic Ranking in Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server](https://github.com/microsoft/Semantic-Ranker-Solution-PostgreSQL)

👉 Follow the steps in the repo above first before moving on to the deployment steps below.

👉 Once you deploy this accelerator, notate the `"/score"` REST endpoint URI and the key.  You will need these in the steps below when deploying.

### Deployment Steps For using Posix (sh) 
1. Enter the following to clone the GitHub repo containing exercise resources:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/graphrag-legalcases-postgres.git
    cd graphrag-legalcases-postgres
    ```
2. Use sample .env to create your own .env
    ```bash    
    cp .env.sample .env    
    ```
3. Edit your new .env file to add your Azure ML Semantic Ranker endpoints
    - Use the values obtained during the Prerequisite Steps above.
    - Replace the values between the {} with your values for each.
    ```bash
    AZURE_ML_SCORING_ENDPOINT={YOUR-AZURE-ML-ENDPOINT}
    AZURE_ML_ENDPOINT_KEY={YOUR-AZURE-ML-ENDPOINT-KEY}
    ```
4. Login to your Azure account
    ```bash
    azd auth login
    ```
5. Provision the resources
    ```bash
    azd up
    ```
    - Enter a name that will be used for the resource group.    
    - This will provision Azure resources and deploy this sample to those resources, including Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server, Azure OpenAI service, and Azure Container App Service.


### Deployment Steps For using Windows (pwsh)

We recommend and have targeted the use of the sh shell. You can run the provided devcontainer setup by pressing CTRL + Shift + P in Visual Studio Code and selecting the 'Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container' option. This will give you access to an sh shell for your work even if you are using a Windows environment.

However, if you prefer to use your Windows environment directly with pwsh instead, you’ll need to follow these steps:

1. Install azd (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd?tabs=winget-windows%2Cbrew-mac%2Cscript-linux&pivots=os-windows)

2. Install PowerShell (PowerShell-7.4.6-win-x64.msi-> https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/tag/v7.4.6)

3. Install Rust (rustup-init.exe ->https://rustup.rs/)

4. Install Python 3.12 (Windows installer (64-bit)-> https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/)

5. Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en). 

After that, you need to open a new terminal and run these two commands manually. Please note that for Linux it is not required to run these manually, only for Windows, you need to run:
```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e src/backend
```
After completing the above steps, you need to follow the steps provided in [Deployment Steps For using Posix (sh)](#deployment-steps-for-using-posix-sh) above.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Resolutions

1. **Errors During Deployment (`azd up`)**
   If you encounter any errors during the deployment process, run `azd down` to clean up the resources and address the issue. Once resolved, you can run `azd up` again to retry the deployment.

2. **Missing URLs or Configuration**
   If you lose track of the deployment URLs or configuration, you can use the `azd show` command to display the existing URLs and other deployment details.

3. **Checking Region Capacity**
   Before running `azd up`, ensure that your target region has the desired available capacity for your deployment. You can refer to the `main.parameters.json` file to check the capacity needed for Chat, Eval, and Embedding generations. By default, ensure the following minimum capacities or you can try to modify these parameters in the `main.parameters.json` file accordingly if you do not have enough available capacity in your Azure subscription.
     - **GPT-4o:** 30K - AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_CAPACITY
     - **GPT-4:** 80K - AZURE_OPENAI_EVAL_DEPLOYMENT_CAPACITY
     - **text-embedding-3-small:** 120K - AZURE_OPENAI_EMBED_DEPLOYMENT_CAPACITY

4. **Azure Subscription Permissions**
   Ensure that you have the appropriate permissions in your Azure subscription. You should be the **subscription owner** or have equivalent permissions to successfully deploy resources and enable required features.
