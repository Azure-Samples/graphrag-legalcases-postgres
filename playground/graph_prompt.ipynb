Hardman Estate et al., Respondents.\"],\"opinions\":[{\"text\":\"Morris, J.\\\\nAppeal from an order of nonsuit and dismissal, in an action brought by a tenant to recover damages for injuries to her goods, caused by leakage of water from an upper story. The facts, so far as they are pertinent to our inquiry, are about these: The Hardman Estate is the owner of a building on Yesler Way, in Seattle, the lower portion of which is divided into storerooms, and the upper is used as a hotel. Appellant, who was engaged in the millinery business, occupied one of the storerooms under a written lease. Some time in August, 1911, the lessee of the hotel portion, although his lease had not expired, vacated the upper stories, and they continued vacant until after the damage complained of. This lessee not having paid his water rent, the city turned off the water from the hotel portion of the building some time in September. This water service so turned off, it appears, did not affect the storeroom occupied by appellant. There was, however, a dwelling on the rear of the lot which was supplied with the same service pipe as the hotel, and which had been vacated for some time. This vacant dwelling in the rear was rented on November 15, and orders given the city to turn on the water, which was done on November 16. Soon after the water was turned on, it began to o flow through the ceiling and into the room occupied by appellant, causing the damage complained of. An examination of the premises disclosed the fact that, in one of the rooms over the storeroom occupied by appellant, a washstand had been torn from the wall and the water pipes broken,\\' making quite a hole through which the water was escaping. It was also discovered that a large rear window opening on the alley had been broken, making an opening large enough for a person to enter the building. It was also shown that, on three other occasions during the vacancy of the hotel portion, the windows on the alley had been broken, supposedly by boys getting into the building. The lease contained the following clause:\\\\n\\\\u201cThat the said lessee shall hold harmless the said lessor and the said lessor\\\\u2019s agents- from all damages of every kind or nature whatsoever that may occur by reason of any accident on said premises, -and from any damage done or occasioned by or from plumbing, gas, water, steam, or other pipes or sewerage ; or the bursting, leaking or running of any cistern, tank, wash-stand, or waste-pipe in, .above, upon or about said building or premises; and from any damage occasioned by water, snow, or ice being upon or coming through the roof, skylight, wall, trapdoor, or otherwise, and from damages arising from acts of neglect of co-tenants or other occupants of the same building, or of any owners or occupants of the adjacent or contiguous property.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis stipulation, in the judgment of the lower court, exempted the respondents from any responsibility in the matter, and was the basis of the ruling complained of. Stipulations of this character cannot be enlarged upon to include any damage not expressly waived, and it is generally held that such a stipulation will not excuse an injury occasioned by the negligence of the landlord in the management and use of any part of the premises remaining under his control. Levin v. Habicht, 45 Misc. 381, 90 N. Y. Supp. 349; 1 Thompson, Negligence, \\\\u00a7 1143. It has also been held that such stipulations cover only ordinary wear and tear, or sudden action of the elements which could not be guarded against, or negligent acts of other tenants. Randolph v. Feist, 23 Misc. 650, 52 N. Y. Supp. 109; Worthington v. Parker, 11 Daly (N. Y.) 545.\\\\nIt is clear from the facts that the damage to appellant was not caused by any breaking of water pipes on the premises leased to her, nor was it due to any negligence of cotenants, nor of owners or occupants of adjacent property, but was due to the bursting or breaking of water pipes on premises not covered by the lease but within the building, and fall within that clause of the waiver exempting damage occasioned by bursting or leaking of washstands in, above, upon, or about the building, or by water coming through the walls. We think it is also clear that the cause of the damage was not an ordinary leak due to defective plumbing or usual wear, such as might be anticipated in any building and thus be within the contemplation of the parties when entering into a stipulation of this character, but was an unusual and unexpected happening, due to other than natural and anticipated defects or lack of repair in any fixture forming part of the water system of the building.\\\\nThere was no evidence that the proximate cause of this damage was any act of the landlord; and if appellant\\\\u2019s cause must rest upon some positive act of the landlord, it must fail. Negligence, however, may be predicated upon the failure to act where the law imposes a duty; and as between the appellant and the landlord, the occupancy and possession of the upper stories, with all the duties .flowing from such a relation, were with the landlord. The landlord could not excuse itself from this duty to appellant because of -the fact that, as between it and the lessee of the upper stories, the possession and occupancy was that of the latter. And this, we think, is so notwithstanding the tenant of the upper story had vacated within the term covered by the lease and the legal right of possession still remained in him. This might be and doubtless was true, as between the landlord and the upper tenant; and as between them, the upper tenant was still bound under his lease. But, whatever may have been the legal fiction, the facts were the upper tenant had vacated the premises and thus occasioned an actual, if not a legal, vacancy. Possession and control must rest somewhere, and as between the landlord and appellant, who was no party to the lease held by the upper tenant and not bound by any contract between this tenant and the landlord, this possession and control was, we think, with the landlord. It, therefore, seems to us, conceding the rule to be that the landlord is under no legal obligation to repair the demised premises, that it was the duty of the landlord to so control and preserve the upper stories as to keep them in a condition of reasonable safety, in so far as such a condition affected the tenant of the lower story; that, if it negligently suffered the upper story to be out of repair to such an extent as to damage the tenant of the lower story, it must respond in damages, and that the ordinary rule we have just referred to does not cover such condition as the facts here present. Priest v. Nichols, 116 Mass. 401.\\\\nSo far as we can gather from the facts, the injury was .caused by evilly disposed persons breaking into the building through the windows in the alley and outside of the premises covered by the lease to appellant. But the duty to guard the premises, so that such persons could not break into the building and injure the fixtures in the upper story, rested with the landlord and not with the appellant; and as it also appeared that these rear windows had been broken on three previous occasions, thus affording entrance to the upper stories, the landlord is chargeable with knowledge of the fact, and having knowledge it was its duty to guard against any recurrence and the natural consequences of such a trespass, by either protecting the premises from such a breaking, or investigating as to any harm that might have been occasioned thereby. The landlord also knew that the hotel section and the house in the rear were connected with the same water service pipe, and before the water was turned on, should have made an investigation of the upper floors to ascertain whether or not such an act could be done with safety to the premises occupied by appellant. Such failure to properly exercise superintendence over the upper story might, it seems to us, within the facts of this case, be\\\\u2019held negligence. Rosenfield v. Newman, 59 Minn. 156, 60 N. W. 1085. At least, we are not so clear it was not negligence as to say the question should not have been submitted to the jury. This disposes of the dismissal as to The Hardman Estate.\\\\nJohn Davis & Company was only the rental agent of the owner. Appellant, having dealt with a known owner and having sought to enforce her cause of action against the principal, cannot hold the agent, and. as to this respondent the dismissal is sustained.\\\\nThe judgment is affirmed as to John Davis & Company, and reversed as to The Hardman Estate.\\\\nCrow, C.

Gjarde, by the terms of which Gjarde agreed to erect for the DeHoneys a building on a described tract of land, in the city of Seattle, to be used as a dancing academy. The contract provided that Gjarde should furnish all the necessary labor and materials and erect the building according to plans and specifications agreed upon between the parties,- prepared by one Svarz as architect. The contract price was $27,329, and the building was to be completed on or before 110 days from tbe date of tbe contract. Gjarde entered at once upon tbe performance of tbe work, completed it witbin tbe time fixed by tbe contract, and was paid tbe contract price.\\\\nDeHoney and wife took possession of tbe building sometime in August, 1923, and began to use it for tbe purposes for wbicb it was constructed. Tbe building gave no trouble during tbe dry weather wbicb followed tbe time possession was taken, but in tbe latter part of October, when tbe. rainy season began, water came into tbe ball of tbe building used for dancing in considerable quantities; so considerable, in fact, as to damage tbe furnishings and to cause tbe dancing floor to swell and buckle. The DeHoneys conceived that tbe water came into tbe room because of a defective and leaking roof, and called upon Gjarde to repair it. Some correspondence passed between them, resulting in a denial on tbe part of Gjarde of liability. Tbe DeHoneys caused tbe roof to be repaired by another person, and caused some additional ventilation to be installed in tbe building, whereupon water ceased to come into the room, and the walls thereof became dry soon thereafter.\\\\nTbe DeHoneys, as plaintiffs, thereafter began tbe present action to recover against Gjarde and bis bondsman, tbe Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland, in damages for tbe injuries caused by tbe water. They alleged that Gjarde failed to construct tbe building in accordance with tbe plans and specifications, in that be \\\\u201cnegligently and carelessly failed to turn up tbe felt and flashings onto the walls of said building not less than 18 inches as tbe contract and good workmanship required, but instead turned tbe same up not to exceed 12 inches in any place, and around tbe greater portion of tbe walls, not to exceed four inches, and negligently and carelessly failed to put tbe same up tight against said walls or to nail or otherwise fasten or cement the same at sufficiently close intervals, so that as a result the upper portions of the same were allowed to be loose and to bulge out from said walls, so that water could go- through where the same should have been fastened tight to the walls and from thence go down under the roofing and thence into the building; that where there were columns erected just inside said side walls, making numerous angles, the said felt and flashings were in some places pressed in so hard by them as to have cracked and broken the same, leaving openings for the water to go through, while in other places, they negligently and carelessly failed to press the same into- the angles sufficiently, but on the contrary allowed the same-to be loose and to bulge out at the top where it should have been tightly joined to the wall, so that the water could run down into the building as hereinbefore mentioned; that they negligently and carelessly allowed approximately 100 holes and openings to be and remain where the water could leak through, said holes and openings, for the most part being located where said felt and flashings should have been joined tight to the wall and columns, and where the same had been broken as hereinbefore mentioned, which were thereupon hidden by them by placing the counter flashings so as to conceal the same; that the top of said counter flashings was fastened by them to a wooden strip set in the concrete wall; that they negligently placed around said wooden strip certain plaster which was made out of poor material in that there was too much sand in the same, so that the same was so porous that it allowed the water to run through the same and back of said counter flashings and that much of said plastering material fell out after the same became water soaked; that the felt and flash-ings around the ventilators were not properly fastened by them, as hereinbefore stated, so- that the same were loose and bulged at the top, allowing the water to leak in; that the paper used by them on the slopes where the roof slopes steeply from the upper portion of the roof to the \\'valley\\\\u2019 portion of the roof below, was of poor quality, in that the same was checked and cracked; that the paper used by them on the roof and slopes was so put together by them that the same would leak at the joints and seams, the cause thereof not being known to plaintiffs; that along the south side of said building there were leaks under the windows; that they wholly failed to place any galvanized iron boxes in the comers, surrounding the drain pipes, but instead placed boxes made of cheap tin, none of which were securely soldered, so that the water leaked out of them, instead of going into the pipes; that no screens were placed in said boxes until after the first rains hereinafter mentioned, and on approximately the 17th day of November, 1923, thus allowing said pipes to become clogged; that by reason of the matters herein-above set forth, said building, when turned over to the plaintiffs on or about Aug. 29,1922, did not have a roof capable of turning water during an ordinary rain, but on the contrary said roof was in such condition as to be leaky in wet weather, none of which defects were discovered by plaintiffs or known to them until the rains hereinafter mentioned occurred.\\\\u201d\\\\nDamages were claimed in the following sums for the following items:\\\\nRepairing roof ........................... $541.35\\\\nCarpenter work .......................... 400.30\\\\nRedecorating the walls and work on damaged paintings ............................. 403.65\\\\nPlumbing work........................... 25.47\\\\nTinning.................................. 5.25\\\\nResurfacing the dancing floor.............. 600.00\\\\nRedecorating the walls and ceiling.......... 1,500.00\\\\nAdditional work on paintings.............. 600.00\\\\nDamage to seats.......................... 800.00\\\\nDamage to piano...................\\\\u2022...... 500.00\\\\nDamage to curtains....................... 300.00\\\\nDepreciation of building (Not repairable).. .10,000.00\\\\nLoss of profits because of non-usability of building ..............................25,000.00\\\\nThe first five of the items of damage were for money actually expended for the work therein indicated. Other items, in so far as they relate to work, were the estimates of witnesses of the reasonable cost of performance. The remaining items are self-explanatory. After issue had been joined on the complaint, a trial was entered upon before a jury. During the course of the trial the court withdrew from the consideration of the jury the item of damage relating to loss of profits. The jury, on the remaining items, returned a general verdict for the plaintiffs in the sum of $14,500.25. Within due time, the defendants moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or, in the alternative, for a new trial. The court denied the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, but entered an order to the effect that it would grant the motion for a new trial unless within twenty days thereafter the plaintiffs would in writing remit from the amount of the verdict the sum of $10,000; further ordering that, in case such remission be made, the plaintiffs have judgment for the amount of the remainder of the verdict. The remission was filed within the required time, and thereupon judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiffs for the sum of $4,500.25.\\\\nThe plaintiffs also moved for a new trial on the question of damages for loss of profits, which motion the court denied. Both parties appeal; the defendants from the judgment entered, and the plaintiffs from the order of the court refusing them a new trial on the question of the loss of profits.\\\\nTaking up the appeal of the defendants, they first assign error on the ruling of the court denying them a new trial. Under this head they present a number of questions, the first being that the verdict was the result of passion and prejudice on the part of the jury. It is said that this is evidenced (1) by the amount of the verdict, (2) because the verdict is contrary to the evidence, and (3) because the trial court so found. Noticing these in their order, of the first it can be said that the verdict was well within the testimony introduced on the part of the plaintiffs. The total sum claimed by the plaintiffs, and which their evidence tended to prove, omitting the claim of $25,000 for loss of profits which the court took from the jury, was $15,676.02. The general verdict of the jury was for $14,500.25. Manifestly, it seems to- us this is not so close an approximation to the plaintiffs\\\\u2019 claims as to furnish conclusive proofs that the jury gave the evidence no consideration, but followed blindly the plaintiffs \\\\u2019 testimony.\\\\nNor did the question of the amount of damages suffered rest upon the testimony of the plaintiffs alone. They were supported by competent disinterested witnesses, some of whom had made estimates with a view of repairing the damages. Nor was the item of depreciation without evidence in its support. In addition to the estimates, a witness who had been engaged in building construction for twenty-three years testified that in his judgment the building was depreciated in value by the flooding to which it had been subjected in the sum of $10,000. The amount of the depreciation is, of course, of no moment on the present appeal, since the plaintiffs consented to waive their claim thereto rather than submit to a new trial. It is mentioned to repel the inference which might otherwise be thought to obtain, that the jury returned a verdict for a claim unsupported by evidence. True, there are affidavits of certain jurors to the effect that some of the items of damage were allowed in full and others disallowed, but conceding that jurors may thus explain their verdict after their discharge, there is nothing in the fact which so far impeaches it as to require the court to say that it was the result of passion and prejudice. Moreover, we do not find\\' in the record that the estimates of the plaintiffs \\\\u2019 witnesses were disputed by the other side. There was a leakage from the roof at one time for which the defendants admitted fault, and they offered testimony to the effect that the damage caused thereby did not exceed $50, but on the general question of the amount of damages, the cause went to the jury on the testimony of the plaintiffs \\\\u2019 witnesses. It would seem that, under these circumstances, the court could hardly find either passion or prejudice had the verdict been for the full amount demanded.\\\\nThe second contention under this head is that the overwhelming weight of the evidence relating to the cause of the damage is against the verdict of the jury. It is first argued that the building was constructed according to the plans and specifications, and if it was so constructed as not to furnish protection against leaks in the roof, it was the fault of the plaintiffs who furnished the plans and specifications, and not the fault of the builder. To an understanding of this argument some notice must be taken of the plans and specifications. The building was in size 72 feet by 128 feet. It was a one-story building with the ceiling 18 feet above the floor. The walls were of six-inch reinforced concrete. The roof was for the greater part comparatively flat, breaking down at rather a sharp angle as the walls were approached, forming a valley or gutter along the walls. The frame work was of wood construction covered over with sheathing hoards. Over the sheathing boards was laid a dry sheet of felt, and over this four layers of felt glued together with roofing cement. On top of this was poured a coating of asphalt onto which gravel was spread. The construction of the slopes was the same as the main part of the roof, except that the gravel was omitted and in its stead was placed an additional thickness of 3-ply Lastile roofing, called a finishing sheet. The plans required the felt to reach across the valley formed by the junction of the roof and the wall, and to extend up the wall for a distance of 18 inches. This extension is called in the record the base-flashing. It was to be well pressed into angles of the wall, reinforced with a strip of felt eight inches wide, cemented solidly in place, and covered by a counter-flashing \\\\u2014 a strip of galvanized iron fastened into the wall and bent over the base-flashing. The counter-flashing was fastened to a reglet placed in the wall at the time the concrete was poured. The valleys or gutters were constructed with a slope or pitch towards the comers of the building wherein were placed outlet boxes with pipes leading to the city sewers, furnishing an escape for water falling on the roof.\\\\nBy some miscalculation the reglets were not placed high enough in the walls of the building to permit the base-flashing to extend up the walls for the distance called for by the plans and specifications \\\\u2014 the actual distance, instead of being eighteen inches as the plans required, was twelve inches at the highest place, ranging from that distance down to four inches at the lowest. It was the testimony of plaintiffs and their witnesses that the base-flashings were not cemented to the wall and that water falling on the roof and flowing into the valley would rise higher than the base-flashing, pass under the counter-flashing and flow down between the base-flashing and the wall of the building and come out into the main dancing hall. The evidence on the part of the defendants, on the other hand, was to the effect that there was no leaking in this manner, that the water that was found in the dancing room was the result of condensation, caused by the crowds that gathered in the room and insufficient ventilation. The evidence on these discordant views it would serve no useful purpose to review. As we read the record, the evidence preponderates on the side of the plaintiffs. At the least, there was substantial evidence supporting the view of the plaintiffs sufficient to warrant the jury in so finding without subjecting them to the charge of being controlled by the undue influence of passion and prejudice.\\\\nThe third ground assigned for the conclusion that the jury were influenced by passion and prejudice in rendering their verdict, we think, is also without foundation. The matter arose out of the argument of one of the plaintiffs\\\\u2019 counsel to the jury. It appears in the record by affidavits filed by the defendants in support of their motion for a new trial, and opposing affidavits by the other side, no stenographic report of the argument being taken. In the defendants\\\\u2019 affidavits counsel for the plaintiffs is accused of stating to the jury that the court in its rulings and conduct unduly favored the defendants; the more precise charge being that counsel stated to the jury that in his cross examination of one of the defendants\\\\u2019 witnesses he had the witness \\\\u201ccornered,\\\\u201d and that the court came to his relief by calling a recess, giving the witness an opportunity to collect his thoughts. In the opposing affidavits it is admitted that counsel said something in the nature of the remark cited to* the jury, but he denies that his language was capable of the interpretation put upon it by the defendants, that he expressly disclaimed at the time that he was charging the court with unfairness, and stated expressly that the recess was called because the usual time therefor had arrived. * In passing upon the motion for a new trial, the court stated that he thought the remark was very unfortunate, and that it \\\\u201cmust have had some effect upon the jury\\\\u201d; further stating that ordinarily remarks of this sort \\\\u201creact on the person making the remark, but it is evident in this case it did not, in view of the verdict that was returned.\\\\u201d\\\\nIt is from these statements of the court that the defendants draw the conclusion that the court found that the jury\\\\u2019s verdict was the result of passion and prejudice. But we cannot draw therefrom a like conclusion. The court\\\\u2019s very ruling on the motion is conclusive to the contrary. The trial judge is distinguished and experienced. He has long presided on the trial bench, and it is unthinkable that his sense of justice would permit him to let the verdict stand if he was of the belief that it was founded on something other than the evidence in the cause. It is our feeling that much is here made of little. At the time of the argument, the remark was not regarded as of sufficient moment to require notice either by the trial judge or by the opposing counsel. Manifestly, if it was then thought that it contained the sinister charge now imputed to it, it would not have gone unchallenged.\\\\nIt is further argued in this connection that the remarks imputed to counsel require a reversal in any event, regardless of the question of passion or prejudice. But we think we need not pursue the inquiry further than to add that in this aspect it is not sufficiently before the court for review. No objection to the remark was made at the time of its utterance. The rule is that improper argument of counsel cannot be successfully assigned as error unless there has been a request to the court to correct it by instructing the jury to disregard it, or unless the misconduct is so flagrant as to be incapable of cure by instruction. Canfield v. Seattle Cornice Works, 122 Wash. 318, 210 Pac. 773; Vanderveer v. Hillman, 122 Wash. 684, 211 Pac. 722. In our view, there was nothing in the remark here incapable of cure by instructions.\\\\nThe next contention is that, if the damage to the building was the fault of a leaking roof, it was due to defects in the design of the building and not due to the fault of the contractor. To an understanding of the objection some further description of the manner in which the roof was constructed is necessary. Where the roof supports joined the wall of the building, a valley was left by the mode of construction required of some eight or nine inches wide only. The plans required a galvanized iron drain box twelve inches wide to be inserted in the valley to facilitate the flow of water to the outlet pipes located at the comers of the building, and further required that the drain should have a slope. A drain box twelve inches wide would not thus rest on the top of the supporting beams, or closer thereto than some four or more inches. In making the measurements for the insertion in the wall of the reglets at the time of its construction, no allowance was made either for this elevation or for the slope of the box, and apparently there were other things which raised the bottom of the valley for which no allowance was made. As the position of the reglets measured the height of the base-flashings, the result was that the flashings did not extend eighteen inches above the bottom of the valley.\\\\nIt is claimed that the scale drawings of the architect showing the position in the wall at which the reglets were to be inserted made no allowance for these differences, and that there was thus a conflict between the plans and specifications and the scale drawings, and that the builder was justified in following the scale drawings. It is further contended that the architect, who was empowered by the building contract to reconcile conflicts that might exist between the plans, specifications and drawings, had his attention called to this discrepancy at the time it was discovered, and that he not only approved the work at that time, but also subsequently accepted the completed work as a compliance with the contract. But we cannot accept these conclusions. As we view the drawings, it required some rather delicate measurements to determine the position of the reglets in the wall from the drawings alone, and that error could easily occur by relying upon such measurements. But the rule is that plans, specifications and drawings for a building must be construed as a whole, and plainly, nothing more than a casual examination of the whole would at once disclose that measurements from the top of the roof beams would not permit the insertion of the base-flash-ings to the height required by the plans and specifications. Nor do we think that the approval of the architect bound the owners. At the time of the acceptance and final payment, they were ignorant of this failure to follow the plans and specifications, and we find this clause in the contract:\\\\n\\\\u201cNo payments or certificate, final or otherwise, shall be construed to relieve the contractor from his obligation to make good any defects arising or discovered in his work within six months after the completion and acceptance of the same.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe discovery of the defect was made within the six months\\\\u2019 period, and within that time a demand was made upon the builder to repair it, with which demand there was no compliance.\\\\nThe specifications provided:\\\\n\\\\u201cThe roofing contractor shall give a satisfactory written guarantee on the roof, guaranteeing same for the period of ten years against leaks, and keeping the same in repair during the ten years.\\\\u201d\\\\nAs a compliance with this clause of the specifications the builder procured a letter from the corporation to whom he had let a subcontract for installing the roof, in which the subcontractor agreed to maintain the roofing installed by them for a period of ten years. The recited conditions were:\\\\n\\\\u201cThis agreement relates only to the material and workmanship furnished by us, and will be fulfilled by repairing free of charge any leaks resulting\\\\u2019 from defects in such material or workmanship. This maintenance agreement is issued to Peder P. Gjarde of Seattle, Wash., and refers to approximately lOb^ squares of roofing completed on the 5th day of June, 1922, on a building located on Lot 12 and south 20 feet of Lot 11, Block 11, Nagles Addition to the City of Seattle, known as the DeHoney Dancing Academy building.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis letter was forwarded to the plaintiffs and retained by them. The defendants requested the court to charge the jury that the \\\\u201cletter constituted a sufficient and satisfactory guarantee and complied with the terms of the specifications,\\\\u201d and that \\\\u201cthe liability of the defendants in this case is limited to the fair and reasonable costs in putting the roof in satisfactory condition, if you find that it was leaky or defective, . . . and you cannot award\\\\u201d the plaintiffs \\\\u201cdamages for any injuries to their building, its floors, walls or contents.\\\\u201d The court declined to give the instruction and error is assigned thereon. Were this an action based upon the special warranty set forth, possibly the rule for which the defendants contend might be applicable. But this is not such an action. It is an action based upon the building contract as an entirety, of which this warranty is only a part. The question is not, therefore, was there a breach of the warranty, but is rather, was there a breach of the building contract. In such an action the measure of damages is the amount of damages which naturally result or flow from the breach complained of, and which were contemplated by the parties as a probable consequence of the breach. School District No. 172 v. Josenhans, 88 Wash. 624, 153 Pac. 326. There can, we think, be no question that a breach of that part of the contract relating to the construction of the roof, if the breach was of such a nature as to cause it to leak water in quantities such as was shown here, would materially damage the interior of the building as well as the contents of the building. There can, therefore, be a recovery of the damages ensuing from the breach, re.gardless of the terms of the special contract to keep the roof in repair.\\\\nThe sixth assignment of error relates to the evidence introduced to show a loss of profits. It will be remembered that the court, during the course of the trial, withdrew this item of damage from the consideration of the jury and instructed the jury not to consider the evidence relating thereto. At this stage of the proceedings the plaintiffs had introduced a considerable part of their evidence on the subject, and it is contended that, notwithstanding the withdrawal of the item from the consideration of the jury and the instruction given, the prejudicial effect of the evidence was not thereby cured. But we see nothing unusual in this circumstance. In the trial of causes it frequently happens that the court must, from the nature of the case, admit evidence on subjects which he must afterwards withdraw from the consideration of the jury, aud if this must in every case require the trial court to discharge the jury then empaneled and commence over again, \\\\u201cthere will,\\\\u201d as we said in Bayers v. Barry, 114 Wash. 252, 194 Pac. 993, \\\\u201cbe no end to law suits.\\\\u201d But the rule is not thus stringent. In the early case of Lyts v. Keevey, 5 Wash. 606, 32 Pac. 534, we said we were not disposed to adopt the rule that evidence improperly admitted cannot be counteracted in the subsequent course of the trial by instructions withdrawing its consideration from the jury. This rule we have followed in many subsequent cases. See: Wilson v. West & Slade Mill Co., 28 Wash. 312, 68 Pac. 716; Yakima Valley Bank v. McAllister, 37 Wash. 566, 79 Pac. 1119, 107 Am. St. 823, 1 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1075; Billings v. Snohomish, 51 Wash. 135, 98 Pac. 107; and the cases collected in the cited cases.\\\\nIn State v. Gay, 82 Wash. 423, 144 Pac. 711, concerning this question, we said:\\\\n\\\\u201cBut it is contended that the evidence was so far prejudicial as to be incapable of cure by its withdrawal from.the consideration of the jury. To this point, the appellant cites State v. Pryor, 67 Wash. 216, 121 Pac. 56. That case, however, was an extreme case. The evidence admitted and subsequently withdrawn had reference to offenses degrading in their nature, in no way connected with the offense upon which the appellant was being prosecuted, and was withdrawn only on condition that the defendant would admit a fact necessary to be shown in order to convict him of the offense with which he was charged. Under these circumstances, the court could well conclude that the act of the court did not remove the prejudice occasioned by the admission of the improper evidence. But it was not \\'therein intended to be held that no error in the admission of improper testimony can be cured by such means, and especially was it not meant to be held that evidence, not objectionable in itself, but improperly admitted because of a circumstance not shown when the testimony was offered, cannot be cured by withdrawing it from the consideration of the jury. The presumption in all cases is that the jury obeyed the instructions of the court, and this presumption must prevail until it is overcome by some showing that the fact is otherwise. To withdraw evidence subsequently discovered to be improperly admitted is a common practice in criminal as well as in civil causes, and the procedure is generally held to cure any error caused by its improper admission. State v. Manville, 8 Wash. 523, 36 Pac. 470; Yakima Valley Bank v. McAllister, 37 Wash. 566, 79 Pac. 1119, 107 Am. St. 823, 1 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1075. We think in the present case any error committed by the admission of the testimony objected to was cured by its subsequent withdrawal.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis court has held, it is true, in cases other than the case referred to in the last cited case, that, there are circumstances where the prejudicial effect of improper evidence is not removed by instructions to disregard it, but it will be found from an examination of the cases that they present circumstances differentiating them from the general rule, matters not present in the case now before us.\\\\nThe account book of the plaintiffs showing their receipts and disbursements in the operation of the building prior to and during the time the leakage from the roof occurred, was admitted in evidence as tending to prove loss of profits. When this item of damage was withdrawn from the jury the book as evidence was also stricken. By some inadvertence, however, it was sent to the jury room along with the exhibits in the cause. The affidavits of the jurors submitted show that the book was not examined by the jurors until after they had agreed upon a verdict, when some member of the jury read certain items therefrom. As the book related to matters which the court had instructed them were not for their consideration, it is difficult to see wherein it could have a prejudicial effect even-had it been examined by the jury. But conceding that prejudice under that circumstance might he presumed, the fact shown precludes error. The rule is thus stated in Thompson on Trials, \\\\u00a7 2590:\\\\n\\\\u201cIf the paper was taken out by mistake, and not by the fraud or design of the prevailing party, or his counsel, and if it was not in fact read by the jury, then there is no occasion to grant a new trial; since no harm has been done to the party against whom the verdict was rendered, and the other party has done no wrong for which he is to be punished. And the rule is the same where it is made to appear that the only jurors who read the objectionable paper had already agreed to return the verdict which was rendered. As the affidavits of jurors are generally admissible to sustain their verdicts, it may be shown by such evidence that the paper was not in fact read by any of the jury.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\u25a0 Here the book went to the jury by mistake, and not by fraud or design of the prevailing parties or their counsel. Nor was it considered by the jury. Hence, in the language of the authority cited, \\\\u201cno harm has been done to the party against whom the verdict was rendered. \\\\u2019 \\\\u2019\\\\nThe plaintiffs\\\\u2019 witness Kubat was permitted, over the objection of the defendants, to testify to the damage to a piano in the building caused by moisture. The objection was based on the ground that he had not shown sufficient qualifications. Frbm his testimony it appears that he had had twenty years\\\\u2019 experience as a piano tuner, that he had been in the wholesale and retail trade of pianos for fifteen years, that he was familiar with prices of pianos in Seattle, and had done much work on the piano in question. At the time he was testifying he could not recall the make of the piano, but testified that it was a baby grand, a brand new instrument, and that the damage was to the strings, the pads, and the sounding board; the latter injury causing the principal damage. In our opinion, he was qualified to testify. The weight to be given to his testimony was, of course, for the jury, but its admission neither requires a reversal nor the deduction of this item of damage from the amount of the verdict.\\\\nCertain witnesses were called by the plaintiffs on rebuttal, and it is objected that their testimony is not proper rebuttal. These objections we shall not notice in detail, as we can see no such prejudice as would require a reversal, even were the objections well taken. But, more than this, we cannot conclude that the objections are well taken.\\\\nThe remaining assignments relate to the instructions of the court to the jury. There were requests for instructions which the trial court refused to give, and there were instructions to which the defendants excepted. In the main, they involve the question of the proper construction of the contract. These in part we have hereinbefore adverted, in which we have declined to follow the construction of the defendants, and have followed that of the trial court. These require no further discussion. Those not heretofore involved will be briefly noticed. The defendants requested the following instruction:\\\\n\\\\u201cI instruct you that by the express terms of the contract in evidence in this case, the architect, Louis Svarz, was the agent of the owner, J. H. DeHoney, and as such had authority to represent and bind the owner by all of his directions and orders to the defendant Gjarde.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe court, on the subject-matter, gave the following:\\\\n\\\\u201cI instruct you that by the express terms of the contract in evidence in this case, the architect, Louis Svarz, was the agent of the owner, J. H. DeHoney, and as such had authority to represent and bind the owner by all of his directions and orders to the defendant Gjarde\\', in so far as the quality of the materials-and workmanship were concerned, but not as to any material deviation from the plans and specifications.\\\\n\\\\u201cYou are instructed that it is provided in said contract and specifications that no alterations shall be made in the work shown or described by drawings and specifications, except upon the written order of the architect; that no deviation from the drawings or specifications shall be made in the execution of the work without the written approval of the architect; that no verbal statement of any person whomsoever shall be allowed in any manner or degree to modify or otherwise affect the terms of the contract of specifications, and that changes shall be made only and strictly according to contract.\\\\u201d\\\\nIn its instructions the court but followed the provisions of the contract. There was elsewhere in the contract, it is true, recitals to the effect that the architect was the agent of the owner, and that his interpretation of the contract should be final, but these provisions referred to instances of repugnant provisions of the contract, or to instances where the contract did not speak; it gave the architect no- power to- modify provisions capable of but one interpretation. As we said in Dyer v. Middle Kittitas Irr. Dist., 40 Wash. 238, 82 Pac. 301:\\\\n\\\\u201cThe contract provides that the engineer shall define the meaning, intent, and purport of the plans and specifications, and that his decision in all cases shall be final; but this, it is plain, refers to the interpretation of doubtful and uncertain terms of the contract, not to the question of law presented by the language of the contract or specifications. This clause does not confer upon the engineer the power to vary the meaning of plain terms used in the contract, for if this were so, there would be no need of the writing, as the engineer\\\\u2019s arbitrary assertion would be all-sufficient.\\\\u201d\\\\nSee, also: Hurley v. Kiona-Benton School Dist., No. 27, 124 Wash. 537, 215 Pac. 21; Mercantile Trust Co. v. Hensey, 205 U. S. 298.\\\\nThe trial court further on in its instructions quoted certain of the provisions of the contract relating to the manner of constructing the roof, and instructed the jury that even though they should find that the defendant Grjarde had the roofing work done by a subcontractor, he would nevertheless be under obligation to see that there was no deviation from the contract. The defendant objects to this for the reason that it amounted to an instruction that the defendant was obligated \\\\u201cto see that the base flashing was turned up 18 inches, which was the pivot of the whole case.\\\\u201d \\\\u2022 In our opinion, the instruction was correct, even though it be so construed. As we have before indicated, the fact being admitted that there was not a compliance with the contract with reference to the construction of the roof in the respect stated, it followed as matter of law that there was a breach of the contract, for which the defendant was liable in damages for the injury that arose from the breach. Error, therefore, cannot be predicated on an instruction so stating.\\\\nTurning to the plaintiffs\\\\u2019 appeal, we find no error in the ruling of the court withdrawing from the consideration of the jury the question of loss of profits. True, this court is committed to the rule that loss of profits may be recovered, but we have said that the loss must be shown with a reasonable degree of accuracy, and that the testimony establishing the loss must be clear and free from taint of speculation or conjecture. Kohne v. White, 12 Wash. 199, 40 Pac. 794; Purcell v. Warburton, 70 Wash. 129, 126 Pac. 89; Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co., 102 Wash. 423, 172 Pac. 47; Brinnon Logging Co. v. Carlsborg M. & T. Co., 122 Wash. 483, 210 Pac. 945; Schermerhorn v. Sayles, 123 Wash. 139, 212 Pac. 156.\\\\nThe cases cited and the cases referred to in the citations illustrate the rule as we have applied it, and the principle involved requires no further elucidation. The evidence introduced shows that any verdict rendered thereon must, as to its amount, be speculative and conjectural, and we conclude that it was properly withdrawn from the consideration of the jury.\\\\nOur conclusion is that the judgment must be affirmed on both appeals, and it is so ordered. Neither appellant will recover costs in this court.\\\\nHolcomb, Main, Mitchell, and Mackintosh, JJ., concur.\",\"type\":\"majority\",\"author\":\"Fullerton, J.\"}],\"attorneys\":[\"Tucker, Hyland & Elvidge and Mary H.

Appellant testified that the faucet was leaking and his mother had complained to Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey, who looked after the janitor work and were in charge of the building for the owners. Mr. Ramsey came to the apartment, went into the kitchen, and appellant asked him, \\\\u201cHow does it come we are having so much trouble with this hot water faucet, it is leaking again?\\\\u201d, and further, \\\\u201cYou had better take a look at that handle. It seems to me like it is cracked. You had better fix it.\\\\u201d Mr. Ramsey said, \\\\u201cAll right.\\\\u201d\\\\nAppellant was not present when the repair was made, and, being out of his apartment much of the intervening two or three days between the repair and the time of injury, paid no special attention to the faucet. At the time of injury, he was in the kitchen with his mother. She asked him to turn off the faucet as it was leaking again. He testified:\\\\n\\\\u201cI went np to turn off the hot water faucet, and the hot water faucet is on the left hand side as I approached the kitchen sink. I got ahold of the hot water faucet with my left hand, and turned it to the left, which is the proper way to turn that particular faucet, and as I turned it to the left all of a sudden the faucet snapped and the next thing I knew why I pulled my hand away from the faucet and took a look at the palm of my hand, and here was a large piece of the china or porcelain handle imbedded in the palm of my hand. . . . when the faucet broke away I kind of lunged forward, because I had my weight against the faucet, and I went forward, but I didn\\\\u2019t lose my balance. I was on my feet, but I was pressing against the faucet, and when it snapped, my weight against the handle brought me forward, and I kind of lunged forward. \\\\u2019 \\\\u2019\\\\nAfter the accident, he asked Mr. Eamsey what he had done to the faucet that it should leak so shortly after being fixed. Eamsey answered:\\\\n\\\\u201c \\\\u2018Well, I took it apart and I didn\\\\u2019t have any new washer, rubber washer, or gaskets,\\\\u2019 I think he said, or washers, I don\\\\u2019t remember what word he used, and so he said \\\\u2018I took an old one and turned it upside down, and I figured that would do, because it has worked before.\\\\u2019 \\\\u201d\\\\nThe trial court sustained the challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence upon the ground that the respondent was under no duty to repair the faucet, and that, if any liability attached by reason of its gratuitous assumption of the repair, there was no causal connection between the repair of the washer to stop the leak and the breaking of the handle. The court was also of the view that, whatever the defect in the handle, it was as obvious to appellant as to respondent.\\\\nWhile, under the terms of the lease, the landlord was under no duty to make repairs and would not be liable for a breach of its promise to repair, made subsequent to the execution of the lease and without consideration, there is authority for the rule that, even though a gratuitous executory contract would not be binding on a landlord, he would place himself in a different position if he should see fit to treat it as binding and actually enter upon its performance; that, while he is at liberty to repudiate the contract or to perform it at his option, if he chooses to perform he becomes under some measure of liability as to the manner of performance. 16 R. C. L. 1033. If respondent is liable at all, in the present case, it can be only under this view of the law, \\\\u2014 that, having undertaken to repair the faucet, the respondent performed the work in such a negligent manner that injury resulted therefrom to the appellant.\\\\nThe principal repair requested by the appellant was the correction of the leaky condition of the water faucet. Eamsey\\\\u2019s attention was also called to the condition of the porcelain handle, which appellant said was cracked. Conceding, as claimed by appellant, that Eamsey promised to replace the handle, he did not do so, and appellant was in no way misled by his failure. Assuming that the repair of the washer within the faucet was improperly done by Eamsey, there was no causal connection between this fact and the breaking of the handle. Furthermore, as the leaky condition of the faucet continued, it was apparent to the appellant, as well as to respondent\\\\u2019s manager, that the condition was unchanged.\\\\nExpressed in a few words, the relation of the parties was this: The appellant himself had agreed to make all the repairs. He asked Eamsey, the landlord\\\\u2019s manager of the building, to make a repair for him that he himself was under a duty to make. Eamsey undertook to make the repair, but failed to do it in a satisfactory manner. His failure was known to the appellant because the handle was unchanged, and the faucet continued to leak. The condition of the faucet was made no worse by Bamsey\\\\u2019s gratuitous repair of it, or his failure to replace the handle.\\\\nWe are of the opinion that the trial court correctly dismissed the action, and the judgment will be affirmed.\\\\nMillard, C.

King County, Defendant, The City of Seattle, Appellant.\"],\"opinions\":[{\"text\":\"Donworth, J.\\\\nRespondents, as plaintiffs, brought this action against both the city of Seattle and Kang county to recover damages to real property caused by the invasion of surface waters. At the conclusion of the plaintiffs\\\\u2019 evidence, the trial court, sitting without a jury, sustained a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence interposed by the county and dismissed the case as to that defendant. The trial then proceeded with the city as sole defendant, and at the conclusion thereof the trial court rendered an oral decision in favor of the plaintiffs. The city\\\\u2019s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the oral decision having been denied, the court entered findings of fact and judgment for the plaintiffs against the city of Seattle, from which the latter has appealed.\\\\nRespondents were represented in the trial court and in the perfecting of their appeal by counsel other than those who appeared for them at the time of the argument in this court.\\\\nRespondents, husband and wife, are owners of a tract of land in King county, located a few blocks north of the city limits of Seattle at the northwest corner of North 102nd street and Aurora avenue. The property is bounded on the east by Aurora avenue, on the south by North 102nd street, and on the west by an alley which runs north and south parallel to Aurora avenue. About twenty feet north of respondents\\\\u2019 property, this alley is intersected by another alley running west to Linden avenue parallel to North 102nd street. Linden avenue, which runs northerly and southerly, is the next street to the west of Aurora avenue and intersects North 102nd street approximately one hundred yards west of respondents\\\\u2019 property. With the exception of Aurora avenue, which is a primary state..highway, all of these streets and alleys are unpaved county roads.\\\\nRespondents\\\\u2019 land is improved by a store building located on the southern portion of the property, fronting on Aurora avenue, on the rear or west end of which two separate additions have been built which are used for living quarters and garage and storage purposes. The original store building has a concrete foundation wall, but the two additions rest on concrete blocks. Respondents became tenants of this property in 1942, purchased it in 1944 for five thousand dollars, and began to use the additions as their home on May 9,1946.\\\\nIn order to understand the legal problems presented by this case, it is necessary to describe the topography of this area. North 102nd street is a graveled road which has been oiled and compacted. Immediately west of Aurora avenue, this street was graded by filling the traveled portion with gravel to an elevation somewhat higher than that of respondents\\\\u2019 property. For a distance of one hundred fifty feet west of Aurora avenue, the street surface is almost flat, having a very slight crown. The street then begins to rise in its westerly course so that, at its intersection with Linden avenue, its elevation is about twenty-five to thirty feet higher than its elevation adjacent to respondents\\\\u2019 property. West of Linden avenue, North 102nd street continues to rise for a considerable distance. The alley, abutting on respondents\\\\u2019 property on the west, slopes from north to south. The general slope of the ground and the natural drainage in this vicinity is from the northwest to the southeast in the direction of respondents\\\\u2019 property, which forms a sump or pothole.\\\\nThe greater quantity of surface water arising on the hill to the west of respondents\\\\u2019 property travels south on Linden avenue to North 102nd street and east down that street to Aurora avenue. Some surface water flows east down the alley between North 102nd and North 103rd streets, turns into the alley to the west of respondents\\\\u2019 property, and runs south toward North 102nd. Except for Aurora avenue, there are no curbs, gutters, or sewers in this area for the purpose of carrying off the surface water.\\\\nAccording to the testimony of respondent Sydney Stevens (who will be referred to as the respondent unless the context indicates otherwise), the surface wateri,had formed a small drainage ditch on the north side of North 102nd street to within one hundred feet of respondents\\\\u2019 property, where it then leveled out. Prior to January, 1948, according to his testimony, the surface water, with one exception, had always flowed past his property without entering thereon. The single exception was in 1945, when surface water settled in a puddle on North 102nd street near the front of the store building, but the water disappeared after the county deposited gravel in that spot. In respondents\\\\u2019 complaint, it was alleged that there had been repeated floodings of their premises since\\'May 9,1946, but at the trial respondent testified that this allegation was incorrect.\\\\nOn January 20, 1948, the appellant, under a franchise from King county, commenced to lay water mains on North 102nd street connecting with an existing water main on Aurora avenue and running westward. This work was done by a contractor (to whom appellant had awarded this job) with the knowledge and under the supervision of the county engineer.\\\\nA trench, approximately two feet wide and forty-four inches deep, was dug by appellant\\\\u2019s contractor ten feet north of, and parallel to, the center line of the street and twenty feet from the south edge of respondents\\\\u2019 property. The dirt was piled three or four feet high on the south side of the trench. The pipe was laid in eighteen-foot sections, and that portion of the trench was backfilled with earth and water on the same day. Two or three days later, the surface of the street was smoothed off with the blade of a \\\\u201cscoopmobile\\\\u201d (bulldozer with rubber tires). The surface dirt was removed by the contractor and dumped in a place remote from respondents\\\\u2019 property.\\\\nThe alley to the west of respondents\\\\u2019 property was not disturbed in any manner, since no lateral pipes were laid. The job was completed in five days on January 24, 1948. Respondent testified that, after the appellant finished its installation, a barrier of dirt about one foot high was left, which remained several days, but the street was leveled before the rain came in February, 1948.\\\\nThe evidence shows that the job was rather carefully inspected at every stage by both the appellant and King county to make certain that the street was left in the same condition that it was when the job was started. However, no measurements were taken to determine the precise level of the street either before or after the construction. Respondent testified that prior to the time appellant installed the water main the street was not in very good condition and had been neglected by the county. After flooding involved in this action, the county constructed a ditch on the north side of North 102nd street which has since conducted\\' surface water past respondents\\\\u2019 property to the sewer in Aurora avenue.\\\\nDuring the actual laying of the water main, very little rain fell, but between the 13th and 18th of February, 1948, two and thirty-five hundredths inches of rain fell in this area.\\\\nOn February 24, 1948, respondents filed their claim for damages with the appellant city of Seattle, as well as with the county. This claim not having been acted upon within sixty days from the filing thereof, this action was thereafter commenced. Paragraphs VII, VIII and IX of this claim stated as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cVII\\\\n\\\\u201cOn February 16, 1948, and prior and subsequent thereto, there was a substantial rainfall, and the surface waters and seepage flowing on said streets and alleys entered upon the claimants\\\\u2019 property in great volume.\\\\n\\\\u201cVIII\\\\n\\\\u201cAs a result of the repeated flooding of claimants\\\\u2019 premises since May 9, 1946, the soil has been gradually washed away from under the foundation walls of claimants\\\\u2019 house and store building, causing the walls thereof to sag, causing distortions and displacements in the structure of said building. Many of the wooden timbers thereof which have been subjected to repeated water damage have become rotten, and a wooden stairway into the basement of the premises at 10207 Aurora has completely rotted out. The ground under the board walk leading from the sidewalk on North 102nd Street to claimants\\\\u2019 front door has been washed away, causing the walk to sink. The aforesaid flooding has also damaged claimants\\\\u2019 lawn and shrubbery.\\\\n\\\\u201cIX\\\\n\\\\u201cThe aforesaid damage has been gradual and cumulative, increasing with the flooding of claimants\\\\u2019 property which has occurred after each rainfall.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe contention of respondents is that the damage complained of was caused by appellant\\\\u2019s changing the street contours while making a public improvement which resulted in the surface water flowing down the street being diverted onto their property. They maintain that the judgment can be supported either upon the constitutional provision against damaging private property for a public use (Art. I, \\\\u00a7 16) or upon the theory of appellant\\\\u2019s negligence. The trial court in its oral decision indicated that respondents\\\\u2019 recovery in this action was based on the city\\\\u2019s negligence.\\\\nOn the other hand, appellant contends that there is absolutely no proof that surface water was collected by it and discharged upon respondents\\\\u2019 property in a concentrated form, and that there is no proof that the laying of the water main in North 102nd street resulted in any changing of the street contours so as to cause the flooding. Furthermore, it is argued that respondent did nothing to mitigate his damages, although he was aware of the flooding and could have protected his property at nominal expense.\\\\nAppellant assigns as error the making of finding off fact No. VII, the failure to sustain appellant\\\\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of respondents\\\\u2019 evidence, and the entry of judgment against the city for the sum of five hundred dollars.\\\\nFinding No. VII reads as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cAt the time defendant City performed such work on North 102nd Street, there was no substantial rainfall. Approximately in the middle of February, 1948, there was a heavy rainfall, with the result that large amounts of surface waters collected on the high ground west of plaintiffs\\\\u2019 property, and by virtue of the crown of North 102nd Street were prevented from flowing in their natural southeasterly course, but were conducted by open ditches on Linden Avenue and North 102nd Street to the intersection of said streets and thence east down North 102nd to the flat area immediately adjacent to plaintiffs\\\\u2019 property. By reason of the fact that defendant City had altered the contours of said street, the said surface waters thence flowed upon plaintiffs\\\\u2019 property in large volume, causing the foundations of their said buildings to settle, with resulting damage as hereinafter described. But for the construction work done by the defendant City as aforesaid, the said waters would have continued to flow in said street until reaching Aurora Avenue, whence they would have been conducted away by adequate drainage facilities, all without damage to plaintiff, as had been formerly the case.\\\\u201d\\\\nWe have italicized the portion of this finding which is particularly to be .noted in connection with our discussion of the evidence in this case. Primarily, only questions of fact are here involved. North 102nd street, being outside of the city limits of Seattle, was entirely under the jurisdiction and control of King county. Therefore our decision in Kuhr v. Seattle, 15 Wn. (2d) 501, 131 P. (2d) 168 (cited by respondent), is not applicable.\\\\nRespondent calls our attention to the well-established rule that findings of the trial court made upon conflicting evidence will not be disturbed by this court unless we can say that such findings are clearly not supported by the weight of the evidence, citing Michigan Millers Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Oregon-Washington R. & N. Co., 32 Wn. (2d) 256, 201 P. (2d) 207.\\\\nFrom an examination of the entire record in this case, we are constrained to hold that the weight of the evidence does preponderate against the above-quoted finding. We will briefly state our reasons for so holding.\\\\n1. Respondent\\\\u2019s claim against the city and county as well as the complaint (both were admitted in evidence) alleged that there had been repeated floodings of the premises since May, 1946, and that the damage had been gradual and cumulative. At the trial, he testified that these statements were erroneous, but his own witness Meroney, a former neighbor, testified in his deposition that there had been repeated floodings since 1946.\\\\n2. This finding was made in spite of the trial court\\\\u2019s appraisal of respondent\\\\u2019s testimony as unsatisfactory. In its oral decision, the trial court commented upon respondent\\\\u2019s credibility as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cBut I must concede to counsel that the re-reading of this plaintiff\\\\u2019s testimony does not convince me that I would be permitted to found my conclusions upon his sometimes rather disturbing testimony. He was quite an opinionated man and at times was almost flippant, not only towards his own counsel, but towards the Court and everybody else; and it was difficult to get from him just exactly what the facts were. He was bound to argue his case, and that made his own counsel\\\\u2019s problem somewhat difficult, as it did the rest of us.\\\\n\\\\u201cBut, apparently, he does not contend and does not claim to the Court that there was any dam left, a dam of loose earth left there at this point, ten feet north of the center of 102d Street at the time when the flood of -which he complains actually occurred.\\\\u201d\\\\nSince respondent\\\\u2019s testimony was not considered by the trial court as adequate to support its findings, there was no credible testimony as to the essential facts to support the judgment other than that contained in the deposition of Mr. Meroney (whom the trial court did not see or hear testify). The court characterized Mr. Meroney\\\\u2019s testimony as \\\\u201cnot always clear and in some cases it is somewhat conflicting.\\\\u201d The latter\\\\u2019s testimony was outweighed by that produced by appellant.\\\\n3. In opposition to these two witnesses, five witnesses were called by appellant, to wit, the King county district foreman, an engineer employed by the county engineer\\\\u2019s office, the city\\\\u2019s contractor who performed the work, the engineer in charge of the work for the city, and the district engineer for the city. All of them testified that the surface of North 102nd street in the vicinity of respondent\\\\u2019s property was in substantially the same condition after the water main was laid as before this work was done. Thus, the weight of the evidence is to the effect that the city did not change the contours of the street.\\\\n4. In testifying in rebuttal, respondent admitted that the ridge of earth which he claimed appellant had left in the street after this work was completed was leveled off before the heavy rain came in February, 1948. Respondent\\\\u2019s only remaining cause of the flooding was that the city had changed the contours of the street. This is discussed in the preceding paragraph.\\\\n5. The preponderance of the evidence does not support the above-quoted finding because respondent did not sustain the burden of proving that the laying of the water main by the city was the proximate cause of the flooding. Disregarding for the moment respondent\\\\u2019s allegations that there had been repeated flooding since 1946, his evidence merely showed that the flooding here involved occurred during the first heavy rain subsequent to the completion of the work, whereas no flooding took place just prior to doing the work at a time when there was also considerable rainfall.\\\\nRespondent in his brief argues that the photographs taken by him, at the time the flooding occurred, show conclusively that most of the water which damaged his premises came from North 102nd street and not from the alley which forms the westerly boundary of his property. Four of these pictures have been enlarged, and we have given all of them careful consideration. The trial court\\\\u2019s comment regarding these pictures in its oral decision was as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cBut this water, he [respondent] claims, came, in part, down the alley to the west of his property, and partly from the west. I think he suggested he thinks about five times the quantity from the west and probably one quarter from a point to the west, meeting up with one coming from this property.\\\\n\\\\u201cCol. Nelson [appellant\\\\u2019s witness] seemed to think that more water had come down the west alley, east-and-west alley. I mean to a point west of the premises, and the area around east and west, probably than any other direction. But I do not think so, and I won\\\\u2019t stop to refer to it. I think one of the pho\\'tographs taken so indicates. You can almost see the heavy burden of water that came down\\\\u2019 along the north side of 102d Street.. The water in there, those pictures show the presence of water there, and convince me further of the actual presence of an unusual quantity of water; and that is confirmed as well by the testimony of both the plaintiff and his neighbor across the way. The neighbor\\\\u2019s testimony is not always clear and in some cases it is somewhat conflicting.\\\\n\\\\u201cBut the conclusive and elemental fact is that there was an excess of water which was not in accordance with the prior experience of the neighborhood within recent years, or at least that is the testimony. And he is also confronted with the fact that it should fall in exact coincidence with the preliminary construction of the water-pipe line and a rather heavy fall of rain, which followed in the succeeding month.\\\\u201d\\\\nWhile the direction of the flow of the water is not as clearly discernible from the pictures as might be desired, nevertheless, if we assume respondent\\\\u2019s conclusion that the water nearly all flowed onto respondent\\\\u2019s property from North 102nd street to be correct, there would still not be sufficient evidence to support finding No. VII as to the cause of the flooding. The burden was upon respondent to prove that the city changed the contours of North 102nd street and that this change caused the flooding. The most favorable view of the evidence from respondent\\\\u2019s standpoint amounts to no more than a mere possibility that the flooding might have been caused in this manner. This is insufficient to support the trial court\\\\u2019s finding.\\\\nIn Home Ins. Co. v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 18 Wn. (2d) 798, 140 P. (2d) 507, we had occasion to consider a rule of law which is applicable to the present case. We there said:\\\\n\\\\u201cThe rule is well established that the existence of a fact or facts cannot rest in guess, speculation, or conjecture. It is also the rule that the one having the affirmative of an issue does not have to make proof to an absolute certainty. It is sufficient if his evidence affords room for men of reasonable minds to conclude that there is a greater probability that the thing in question, such as the occurrence of a fire, happened in such a way as to fix liability upon the person charged therewith than it is that it happened in a way for which a person charged would not be liable. In applying the circumstantial evidence submitted to prove a fact, the trier of fact must recognize the distinction between that which is mere conjecture and what is a reasonable inference.\\\\u201d\\\\nMore recently, in Gardner v. Seymour, 27 Wn. (2d) 802, 180 P. (2d) 564, the same principle was stated briefly as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cWe have frequently said that, if there is nothing more tangible to proceed upon than two or more conjectural theories under one or more of which a defendant would be liable and under one or more of which a plaintiff would not be entitled to recover, a jury will not be permitted to conjecture how the accident occurred.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis rule is equally applicable whether the trier of fact be a jury or a court sitting without a jury.\\\\nSince w\\\\u00bf find from the record that there is not sufficient evidence to sustain the trial court\\\\u2019s finding that the city changed the contour of North 102nd street in such a manner as to be the proximate cause of the flooding, the respondents are not entitled to any recovery as against the appellant upon either the theory of negligence or upon the theory of the city\\\\u2019s damaging of their property for a public use. To recover upon the latter theory, there must be a showing that the acts of appellant resulted in the damaging of respondents\\\\u2019 property for such purpose. The evidence applicable to this theory is insufficient to bring this case within the scope of our decision in Whiteside v. Benton County, 114 Wash. 463, 195 Pac. 519, and other similar cases cited by respondent.\\\\nThe judgment is reversed, with directions to dismiss the action.\\\\nSchwellenbach, Hill, Grady, and Hamley, JJ., concur.\",\"type\":\"majority\",\"author\":\"Donworth, J.\"}],\"attorneys\":[\"A.

It is unmeandered, which means that in the original federal government survey the surveyors did not locate the shoreline, but merely ran the government section lines across the lake. As a result many shoreline property owners also own subdivided portions of the lake bed. The lake is surrounded principally by single residences, together with a few multiple residences, a public school ground, and a small city park. Residents of the area have long used the entire lake surface for recreational activities.\\\\nThe plaintiffs are 24 property owners who own upland abutting the lake and, in some instances, parts of the lake bed, or who otherwise have access rights to the lake by reason of an easement to the lake shore. Defendants own a parcel of land abutting on the east side of the lake at the south end, about two-thirds of which is upland and one-third lake bed. Title is traced to an 1872 federal government patent, which made no reference to the lake.\\\\nThe south end of the lake, including defendants\\\\u2019 property, has been business zoned for many years, and was formerly operated as Playland Amusement Park. The property is currently zoned commercial general (CG) by the city of Seattle. In zoning the land around the lake the city ran its zoning lines across the lake surface so that the entire lake bed is zoned. Defendants\\\\u2019 submerged land is zoned commercial general, while other portions of the lake bed are zoned residential.\\\\nIn August, 1966 defendants purchased the property in question, after having procured preliminary architectural plans for the construction of four apartment buildings. Apartment buildings Nos. 1 and 2 were to be constructed partly on the upland, but would extend approximately 130 feet out into the lake, supported on two finger-like piers secured by cement pilings. Apartments Nos. 3 and 4 were to be constructed entirely on the upland abutting the lake. Mortgage commitments were obtained based on these plans, and on June 12, 1967, a building permit was issued by the city of Seattle.\\\\nOn June 5, 1967, excavation of the upland was commenced and on June 8 or 9 dirt was first pushed into the lake about 25 feet in order to form a base or pad. Some of the plaintiffs immediately protested to defendants and began making an investigation to determine the extent of defendants\\\\u2019 construction plans. The protests went unheeded so plaintiffs on July 5, 1967, brought an action to enjoin defendants from filling or building over the surface of the lake. In conjunction with that action they posted a $1,000 bond and obtained an exparte temporary order restraining the defendants from interfering with the surface area and shoreline of Bitter Lake.\\\\nThe motion for a temporary injunction was heard on July 15, 1967, by a different department of the superior court than that which later heard the case on the merits. The court denied the motion but delayed the effective date of the order so that plaintiffs might petition this court for a writ of review. On July 20, 1967, that petition was denied by this court on procedural grounds. It was understood at the time that the ruling did not reach the merits of the petition.\\\\nOn July 21, 1967, the temporary restraining order was dissolved. Plaintiffs then made every effort to get the case to trial and in fact secured a substantially earlier trial date than would have been possible through the normal progression of the trial docket in King County. Trial was commenced on October. 10, 1967.\\\\nPending the trial on the merits, defendants proceeded as rapidly as possible with the construction of apartment No. 1 and the concrete slab to support it. The slab projects out into the lake approximately 130 feet and is 77 feet wide. Beneath it the lake is filled with dirt, and pilings of steel beams are used to support it. The slab will be 1.18 feet above high water and 6.18 feet above low water. The apartment constructed on the slab will be three stories in height. At the time of trial it was planned that both apartments Nos. 1 and 2 would extend out over the water. However, in oral argument in this court defendants stated that the plans for apartment No. 2 had been modified so that it would be constructed entirely on upland.\\\\nThe trial court determined that defendants had no right to build out into Bitter Lake, and enjoined them from further construction over the surface of the lake. In addition, defendants were ordered to remove the existing structure and earth fill, which had been put there during the period prior to the trial.\\\\nDefendants\\\\u2019 12 assignments of error are directed to (1) the trial court\\\\u2019s determination that defendants had no right to build out into Bitter Lake, (2) the remedy granted in view of hardship caused to defendants relative to hardship plaintiffs would suffer if the mandatory injunction were denied, (3) prejudice of the trial judge in view of his personal experience as attorney in a prior case which dealt with surface rights of lake shore owners, (4) the trial court\\\\u2019s findings that defendants disregarded protests of plaintiffs and the pendency of this suit, and its failure to include a specific finding on defendants\\\\u2019 good faith, and (5) the trial court\\\\u2019s failure to find adverse possession of the area in question by defendants\\\\u2019 predecessor in title.\\\\nIn the challenge to the trial court\\\\u2019s determination that defendants had no right to build out into Bitter Lake, defendants emphasize the effect of the commercial zoning imposed on their property. Defendants contend that their apartment is a riparian use, and that reasonableness is the test for its permissibility. They further contend that reasonableness in this case is a legislative determination expressed in the city zoning ordinance. In other words, the Seattle City Council, by conferring a commercial general zoning classification on this property, and issuing a building permit, determined that an apartment is a reasonable and proper use of this tract, which includes lake bed property.\\\\nRiparian rights and privileges are conferred upon a property owner by virtue of the contiguity of his property to a body of water. Mayer v. Grueber, 29 Wis. 2d 168, 138 N.W.2d 197 (1965). Although we have never promulgated an all-inclusive definition of riparian rights, we have previously recognized as riparian rights on nonnavigable lakes the rights of swimming, fishing, boating, and bathing. Snively v. Jaber, 48 Wn.2d 815, 296 P.2d 1015, 57 A.L.R.2d 560 (1956). Further, these rights have been characterized as vested property interests, included in the protection afforded by Const, art. 1 \\\\u00a7 16, which provides that private property shall not be taken or damaged for public or private use without just compensation. In re Clinton Water Dist., 36 Wn.2d 284, 218 P.2d 309 (1950).\\\\nWe cannot agree that defendants\\\\u2019 apartment constructed over water constitutes a riparian use, or that its permissibility comes within a rule of reasonableness as determined by the Seattle zoning authorities.\\\\nMere proximity of the apartment to the water does not render it a riparian use. With respect to a structure, such a use must be so intimately associated with the water that apart from the water its utility would be seriously impaired. This is not the case with defendants\\\\u2019 prospective use. The utility of the apartment is in no way dependent upon the waters of Bitter Lake, and its utility as an apartment would be in no way impaired apart from this lake. This is evidenced by the fact that apartments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 are entirely on upland property.\\\\nNor may defendants justify the presence of their apartment by the commercial zoning classification imposed by the city of Seattle or by the issuance of a building permit.\\\\nAll riparian owners along the shore of a natural, nonnavigable lake share in common the right to use the entire surface of the lake for boating, swimming, fishing, and other similar riparian rights so long as there is no unreasonable interference with the exercise of these rights by other respective owners. Snively v. Jaber, supra; Botton v. State, 69 Wn.2d 751, 420 P.2d 352 (1966) , These rights are vested property rights, and may not be taken or damaged for public or private use without just compensation. In re Clinton Water Dist., supra. It follows, therefore, that while the city of Seattle might regulate the exercise of these rights by means of its police power, it may not totally divest plaintiffs of them through the mechanisms of zoning. Indeed, the effect of this case, if we were to follow defendants\\\\u2019 reasoning, would be to divest plaintiffs of valuable property rights for the private use and benefit of defendants. Such a result is clearly contrary to the law, and we are certain was not intended by the Seattle zoning authorities when the commercial general classification was placed on defendants\\\\u2019 property.\\\\nDefendants next assert error in the trial court\\\\u2019s choice of remedy, in that defendants were required to remove the structure it placed out over the surface of the lake. It must be noted, in response to this assertion, that since we have determined that defendants\\\\u2019 apartment does not constitute a riparian use, it becomes in effect an encroachment upon plaintiffs\\\\u2019 common rights to use this portion of the lake surface for purposes of riparian enjoyment. In view of this, it is defendants\\\\u2019 contention that nonetheless, an application of the doctrine of relative hardship, or balancing the equities, requires that they not be enjoined to remove the existing structure now in place. Although it is not clear from the evidence, the amount of loss might be substantial that defendants could suffer if unable to complete apartment No. 1. Estimates by the plaintiffs based on defendants\\\\u2019 figures fix the maximum possible loss at approximately $100,000. Defendants on the other hand contend they will lose in excess of $250,000. The evidence indicates, however, that when it became apparent that defendants faced a lawsuit to halt construction of apartment No. 1 with the ever existing possibility that they might lose, they took no action to mitigate their potential loss by attempting to renegotiate or cancel the construction contracts or other financial commitments. At that time only a small proportion of the total financial commitment had actually been expended and the remaining potential loss depended on the binding effect of the commitments, most of which were oral in nature, the rigidity of the other contracting parties position, and the feasibility of altering construction plans.\\\\nFrom the very commencement of defendants\\\\u2019 construction they were aware of the protests of other riparian owners. The encroaching structure did not exist at the time of suit, but was built during the pendency of this suit. Defendant contractor, Mr. Ray Lotto, testified that after the temporary restraining order was dissolved \\\\u201cwe proceeded as fast as we could, because, at that time, we already lost two weeks.\\\\u201d\\\\nThus, defendants proceeded to construct the apartment in question with full knowledge that their right to do so was contested and that there was a real likelihood, in view of our holding in Snively v. Jaber, supra, that the case on the merits would be decided against them. In addition, the court in its oral opinion dissolving the temporary restraining order, pointed out that the case was going to be appealed, would be a landmark case, and the Supreme Court might look at it differently. During oral arguments defendants\\\\u2019 counsel admitted that they knowingly took a risk by continuing construction while the case was pending on the merits, and indeed, there is no other possible interpretation of defendants\\\\u2019 conduct. Their explanation was that although not much construction had been done on apartment No. 1 they were already financially committed to the entire project and felt they had to take the risk.\\\\nThe benefit of the doctrine of balancing the equities, or relative hardship, is reserved for the innocent defendant who proceeds without knowledge or warning that his structure encroaches upon another\\\\u2019s property or property rights. City of Dunsmuir v. Silva, 154 Cal. App. 2d 825, 317 P.2d 653 (1957); Winthers v. Bertrand, 239 Ore. 97, 396 P.2d 570 (1964). Under the circumstances of this case, defendants are not entitled to evoke the benefit of this doctrine.\\\\nDefendants next assert that the bias of the trial judge prevented them from having a fair trial. This assignment is based on the prior experience of the trial judge as counsel for Dr. J. Howard Snively, who was subsequently a party in Snively v. Jaber, supra. Although the trial judge did not represent Dr. Snively in that suit, he did offer legal advice to him. Defendants argue that that experience prejudiced the judge\\\\u2019s views on the issue of defendants\\\\u2019 good faith and caused him to prejudge the case even before the trial started.\\\\nRCW 4.12.040 provides in part:\\\\nNo judge of a superior court of the state of Washington shall sit to hear or try any action or proceeding when it shall be established as hereinafter provided that said judge is prejudiced against any party or attorney, or the interest of any party or attorney appearing in such cause.\\\\nClearly, defendants show no prejudice which comes within the requirements of this statute. Merely because a judge has had occasion to study a point of law and offer advice based on his interpretation of it is no grounds for disqualification. This assignment is without merit. \\'\\\\nDefendants charge error in the trial court\\\\u2019s refusal to find that defendants\\\\u2019 predecessor in interest, Playland Amusement Park, established the exclusive right to use the disputed portion of the lake by adverse possession. We find no merit to this contention in light of testimony of a former park policeman that his intentions were only to prevent persons from entering the park without paying the entrance fee. There was no evidence that other riparian owners were ever prevented from using the entire surface of the lake, or that the operators of Playland Amusement Park ever intended to assert any proprietary rights over portions of the surface abutting its shore. Indeed, certain residents of Bitter Lake testified that they had always used the entire surface of the lake, including portions over the area owned by defendants, even while Playland was in operation. In any event, it was a disputed question of fact and as there was substantial evidence to support the finding of the trial court, it will not be disturbed on appeal. State ex rel. Carroll v. Seattle Hotel Bldg. Corp., 41 Wn.2d 595, 250 P.2d 982 (1952).\\\\nDefendants next assign error to the trial court\\\\u2019s refusal to grant a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. The evidence was the testimony of a daughter of defendants\\\\u2019 predecessor in interest and related to the question of adverse use of that portion of the lake in dispute. The substance of her testimony was before the trial judge by way of affidavit in support of the motion. It was to some extent cumulative in nature, and we do not feel that the court abused its discretion in denying the motion.\\\\nDefendants finally argue that under Hughes v. Washington, 389 U.S. 290, 19 L. Ed. 530, 88 Sup. Ct. 438 (1967), the federal common law controls the result here; and that under the federal common law the defendants have a right to build their apartment on a fill on their portion of the lake bed.\\\\nThis contention is based on the fact that defendants\\\\u2019 title is to upland property and submerged land, and is traced to an 1872 federal government patent. This patent was issued prior to Washington statehood, and made no reference to the lake.\\\\nIn Hughes, supra, the issue presented was whether federal or state laws governs the ownership of accreted land, gradually deposited by the ocean on adjoining upland property conveyed by the United States to petitioner\\\\u2019s predecessor in title prior to Washington statehood. The United States Supreme Court held that federal law applied, and that under federal law petitioner was entitled to the accretion that had gradually formed along her ocean-front property.\\\\nThe Hughes decision is in no way applicable to the instant case. We are not concerned here with the ownership of land or the extent or validity of title created by a federal act. As stated by Mr. Justice Stewart, concurring in Hughes, 389 U.S. at 295:\\\\nSurely it must be conceded as a general proposition that the law of real property is, under our Constitution, left to the individual States to develop and administer. And surely Washington or any other State is free to make changes, either legislative or judicial, in its general rules of real property law, including the rules governing the property rights of riparian owners. Nor are riparian owners who derive their title from the United States somehow immune from the changing impact of these general state rules. Joy v. St. Louis, 201 U. S. 332, 342. For if they were, then the property law of a State like Washington, carved entirely out of federal territory, would be forever frozen into the mold it occupied on the date of the State\\\\u2019s admission to the Union.\\\\nWe must, therefore, conclude that there was no error in the trial court\\\\u2019s determination of the property rights of the riparian owners on Bitter Lake, nor in the remedy afforded in the form of a mandatory injunction.\\\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\\\nFinley, C. J., Weaver, Hunter, and McGovern, JJ., concur.\\\\nJanuary 24,1969.

Defendant denied the agreement. The case was tried to the court and a jury. A verdict was returned in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant appeals from the judgment entered upon the verdict.\\\\nIt appears that, in the year 1905, the defendant leased lot 2, block 10, Boren & Denny\\\\u2019s addition to Seattle, from the Cyrus F. Clapp estate, for the period of five years. Defendant thereupon erected a one-story brick building upon this lot. This building consisted of several store rooms facing upon Madison street in said city. When the building was about completed, plaintiffs entered into negotiations with the defendant to lease two of these store rooms, numbered 215 and 217 Madison street. The rental and terms of the lease were agreed upon in November, 1905, and upon the 1st of December, 1905, the plaintiffs took possession of the rooms. On the 9th day of December a written lease was entered into, as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cThis indenture of lease made this 9th day of December, 1905, by and between R. J. Ferguson of the city of Seattle, county of King, state of Washington, party of the first part (hereinafter called the lessor) and A. P. Hockersmith, of said city, county and state, party of the second part, (hereinafter called the lessee),\\\\n\\\\u201cWitnesseth: That the said lessor does by these presents lease and demise unto the lessee that certain store room, designated and known as Nos. \\\\u00a315 and \\\\u00a317 Madison street, situated upon lots \\\\u00a3, in Boren & Denny\\\\u2019s addition to the city of Seattle, for a period of two years from the first day of January, 1906, to the 31st day of December, 1907, for the rent or sum of thirty-six hundred dollars ($3,600) payable in gold coin of the United States of America in twenty-four (\\\\u00a34) equal monthly installments amounting to one hundred and fifty dollars ($150) payable in advance on the first day of each and every month during the term of this lease. That said lessee hereby accepts said premises for the term of two years and agrees to pay therefor the sum of thirty-six hundred dollars ($3,600) said sum to be paid at the office of John Davis & Co., No. 709 Second avenue, Seattle, Washington, in the manner and at the times hereinafter specified. That said lessee agrees to pay any and all charges for heat, light and water rates, which shall become due or shall be taxed or assessed against said premises during the term of this lease, and further agrees to make all necessary repairs of whatsoever nature to the interior of said premises, and to deliver up said premises at the expiration of this lease in as good condition as they are now in, excepting the necessary wear and tear thereof and damages by the elements or fire. That said lessee, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns shall hold harmless said lessor\\' from all damages or accidents of every kind or nature whatsoever that may occur on said premises. That said lessee shall not use said premises for saloon or restaurant purposes, nor let or sub-let the whole or any part thereof, nor make or permit to be made any changes \\\\u2022 or alterations whatsoever without the written consent of the said lessor, or John Davis & Co., his agents, nor assign this lease or any part thereof without said written consent. That said lessee shall not use said premises for immoral or illegal purposes, nor under any circumstances permit gambling or the sale of intoxicating liquors upon said premises. It is hereby agreed that if any rent shall be due and unpaid, or if default shall be made in any of the covenants or agreements herein contained, it shall be lawful for the said lessor or John Davis & Co., his agents, to reenter said premises and remove all persons therefrom. That the said lessor, or his agents, shall have the right to enter said premises at all reasonable times, and shall have the further right to place Tor Rent\\\\u2019 signs on said premises thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of this lease.\\\\n\\\\u201cIn witness whereof the parties hereunto have set their hands and seals the day and year first above written.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe lease was signed, sealed, and acknowledged. After the plaintiffs had occupied the building about three months, the defendant sold and conveyed all of his interest in the property to the Cyrus F. Clapp estate, the owner of the fee, and thereafter, on April 2, 1906, the Cyrus F. Clapp estate sold and conveyed the property to Sullivan & Considine. The plaintiffs thereafter, on April 9, with notice of the sale, recorded the lease in the county auditor\\\\u2019s office. Thereafter, in October or November of the same year, the city of Seattle, by its contractors, entered upon the street in front of the property, tore up its sidewalks, and cut away the street some eighteen feet, leaving for several months no means of ingress to or egress from the premises. The plaintiffs brought this action against the defendant for damages caused thereby, and alleged, in paragraph 6 of the complaint, the following:\\\\n\\\\u201cThat at the time of the lease as aforesaid the said premises were desirable particularly for the purpose of plaintiffs\\\\u2019 said business as well as valuable for other commercial purposes, the same being located at 215 and 216 Madison street in the city of Seattle, then and there a popular and valuable location in the business district of said city; then graded and improved and easily accessible to the general public; that at the said time as aforesaid there was then in contemplation a great public improvement of the city known generally and publicly as the 2d Avenue regrade, and which, if the same took place during the life of the said lease, proposed it would, by reason of the interruption and disturbance in the enjoyment of the said premises render the said leasehold of little value as was then and there mutually agreed. That at the time of making the said lease, the plaintiffs and said defendants, by reason of the uncertain condition with respect to the contemplated change of grade in said Madison street, made no provision except as aforesaid in said indenture of lease regarding the remodeling and rebuilding of the said premises and store rooms situated therein. The said defendant landlord and these plaintiffs then and there further agreeing, by an oral, collateral contemporaneous agreement that if the said public improvement did take place during the life of the said lease, with its then agreed attendant damage, and the beneficial enjoyment of the possession be interrupted, that the said defendant R. J. Ferguson would remodel, reconstruct and repair said building as leased, by lowering the floors of the store rooms so leased, to wit eighteen feet, so as to put the same to the level of said Madison street, these plaintiffs agreeing to remove to said store rooms when said floors should have been so lowered. That by so lowering said floor, as aforesaid, the said R. J. Ferguson would be permitted thereby to create a new and additional rentable room in said building above the store rooms then to be occupied by these plaintiffs; and the said lessor then and there further agreed as a further and a part consideration, and as an inducement to enter into said lease hereinbefore described between the plaintiffs and the said defendant R. J. Ferguson, to build and construct a new entrance to the said store rooms, with an attractive glass front and with tiled flooring at the entrance, and to put in new and additional side and end windows, thereby creating said building, whence said floor had been so lowered, into an attractive and desirable store room for the use of these plaintiffs. And as a further part of said agreement, agreed to cause to be constructed a sidewalk in front of said building and premises, and otherwise to so improve the same that they would present an attractive and inviting appearance.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe complaint did not set out a copy of the lease. The defendant, when he appeared in the action, moved the court to strike this paragraph from the complaint. When this motion was denied, defendant demurred, and when the demurrer was overruled, filed an answer setting up the lease, and denied all the facts as alleged in regard to a collateral, contemporaneous, oral agreement. WTien the case was on trial, the defendant objected to the testimony offered in support of the allegations of the complaint as quoted above. These objections were overruled, and the plaintiffs were permitted to testify to the facts substantially as alleged in the complaint. At the close of plaintiffs\\\\u2019 evidence, defendant moved to strike it and for a dismissal.\\\\nThe defendant contended below, and now urges here, that the facts alleged and testified to contradicted and varied the terms of the written lease and were therefore incompetent. The plaintiffs maintain that the evidence was admissible, because it tended to prove an oral, collateral, contemporaneous agreement. The rule is elementary that a written contract may not be varied or contradicted by parol. The rule is also well settled that parol evidence of collateral, oral agreements may be received where the parties have not, by their written contract, appeared to intend to reduce their entire negotiations to written form. Puget Sound Iron & Steel Works v. Clemmons, 32 Wash. 36, 72 Pac. 465; 1 Elliott, Evidence, \\\\u00a7 578. So that the main and controlling question here is, Was the alleged oral agreement a collateral one, or was it a part of the contract of lease. In Elliott on Evidence, \\\\u00a7 578, it is said:\\\\n\\\\u201cParol evidence of a distinct, valid, parol agreement between the parties, although prior to or contemporaneous with the written contract, is not excluded by the rule in question where it does not in any way vary or contradict the writing, and there are some cases in which this is true, although the parol agreement may be collateral to the written contract and relate in some way to the same subject-matter, at least where the writing is silent upon the subject and the parol agreement does not appear to be so closely connected with the matter of the written contract that it should be deemed to have entered into the negotiations or formed a part of the transactions or matter of which the writing was intended to be a complete and final statement. But a complete, valid, written contract merges all prior and contemporaneous negotiations and agreements within its purview, and if the parol agreement is not really collateral, but is an element of the written contract, or tends to vary or contradict the same, either in its express provisions or its legal import, it is inadmissible. The question usually is as to whether the parol evidence sought to be introduced contradicts or alters the written contract, or leaves it to stand unchanged and simply tends to establish an additional collateral agreement. It is often difficult to determine this question, and there is much conflict among the authorities.\\\\u201d\\\\nIn the next section, 579, the same author says:\\\\n\\\\u201cThere is also a class of cases in which it is held that oral evidence of a collateral contemporaneous- agreement which assumes the. contract as indicated by. the writing and undertakes to deal with some contingency, or new relation of the parties in the future that may arise under the written agreement, is admissible. It has also been held that parol evidence is admissible ... to show an agreement to destroy game, rebuild or repair as collateral to a lease, and to show an agreement by a vendor or lessor not to engage in a rival or competing business. But many of these decisions are of questionable soundness, and, as shown in the next section, the weight of authority is against some of them.\\\\u201d\\\\nAnd in the next section, 580, it is said:\\\\n\\\\u201cSo, contrary to decisions referred to in the preceding section, it has been held that a prior or contemporaneous parol agreement by a vendor or lessor not to carry on a competing business is inadmissible where the written contract appears to be complete. And so the better rule is that an oral warranty of the condition of the premises or agreement on the part of the lessor to make repairs .or improvements cannot be shown in such a case.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis appears to be the correct rule, and the one substantially followed by us in Gordon v. Parke & Lacy Mach. Co., 10 Wash. 18, 38 Pac. 755; Morris v. Healy Lumber Co., 46 Wash. 686, 91 Pac. 186, and Tobin v. McArthur, 56 Wash. 523, 106 Pac. 180. It is, therefore, not necessary for us to review the numerous cases which follow or deny the rule.\\\\nIt is conceded in this case that, after negotiations which led up to it, the lease in question was made. It bears upon its face evidence of careful preparation, and shows that the parties to it had considered the many questions in regard to the property; and upon the evidence introduced, it is not questioned that the parties discussed and considered the change in the street grades and its effect upon the property. The written lease provides: \\\\u201cThat said lessee hereby accepts said premises for the term of two years;\\\\u201d \\\\u201cthat said lessee agrees to pay any and all charges for heat,\\\\u201d \\\\u201cand agrees to make all necessary repairs of whatsoever nature to the interior of said premises;\\\\u201d \\\\u201cthat the said lessee shall not use said premises for saloon or restaurant purposes nor let or sub-let the whole or any part thereof nor make or permit to be made any changes or alterations whatsoever without the written consent of the lessor.\\\\u201d This appears to be a plain lease, where the lessor agreed to do nothing except to deliver possession of the premises to the lessee, who agreed to accept the premises as they then were, for a period of two years, and agreed to make all necessary repairs to the interior, and to make no changes or alterations to the building without the written consent of the lessor or his agents. Where there is no express agreement for the lessor to repair or alter the building, no such obligation will be implied. The duty devolves upon the lessee. 24 Cyc. 1081 et seq.; 18 Am. & Eng. Ency. Law (2d ed.), p. 226; Ward v. Hinkleman, 37 Wash. 375, 79 Pac. 956.\\\\nIf there was an agreement by the lessor prior to this writing, to change or repair the building during the term of the lease, that agreement was as much a part of the contract of lease as any other, and should have been incorporated in it. It was clearly not a collateral agreement under the rule first above stated. If tfye agreement was made as alleged and attempted to be proved, it was a part of the contract of lease, and it is strange that so important a matter should have been left out of the written agreement. As was said by Lord Ellenborough, in Powell v. Edmunds, 12 East 6, at page 10:\\\\n\\\\u201cIf the parol evidence were admissible in this case, I know\\' of no instance where a party may not. by parol testimony superadd any terms to a written agreement; which would be setting aside all written contracts and rendering them of no effect.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe trial court therefore erred in not sustaining the defendant\\\\u2019s objection to the evidence, and in refusing to dismiss the case upon the defendant\\\\u2019s motion.\\\\nThe judgment is therefore reversed, and the cause ordered dismissed.\\\\nDunbar, C.

The City of Tacoma, Respondent.\"],\"opinions\":[{\"text\":\"Ellis, J.\\\\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of non-suit and dismissal of an action to recover damages consequent upon the grading of, and construction of storm sewers in, certain streets in the city of Tacoma.\\\\nAbout three years before any of the streets in the vicinity of her property had been graded, the appellant bought lots 5 to 10, inclusive, in block 4, of Elsmere addition to Tacoma. Block 4 fronts to the south on 60th street, and is bounded on the east by J street, on the west by K street, and on the north by the alley between blocks 3 and 4. We reproduce a plat from respondent\\\\u2019s brief the correctness of which seems not to be questioned, merely for the purpose of illustration and to show the location of streets in relation to the appellant\\\\u2019s lots. See nest page.\\\\nElsmere addition is in an outlying part of the city. Some houses had been built there and in that neighborhood, apparently before any of the streets were graded or any drainage provided. The general slope of the land iif that vicinity is from the south and east to the north and west. Appellant\\\\u2019s lots occupy low ground, across which originally the natural drainage of the country to the south and east for a considerable distance flowed. Originally this surface water ran off of appellant\\\\u2019s lots and across block 3 to the northwest. At the time when the city began the grading here in question, improvements and filling by the owners of block 3 had obstructed the natural course of the water, so that it ran in a small ditch \\\\u2014 it does not appear by whom dug\\\\u2014 along the alley to K street, and thence north. There was also a ditch on the southerly side of 60th street which carried a part of the surface water to K street. This was apparently dug after the appellant had purchased and built on her lots; and, also, after that time, the city dug a ditch northward along K street to carry all this surface water to a large drain on 58th street. It appears that these ditches, and also other ditches and drains on this sloping territory, the location and character of which are not made clear by\\\\nthe evidence, had been made, some of them by the city, and others by the owners of different properties. It seems to be admitted that no permanent system of drainage had been constructed or adopted by the city in this territory when appellant purchased her lots and built her house, nor up to the time of the grading complained of in this action. Up to that time, the drainage, such as it was, was merely temporary in character and construction and adapted to the natural surface of the ground.\\\\nIn the fall of 1909, the city, by contract, began the grading of the streets and alleys in the vicinity of appellant\\\\u2019s property. The work apparently included all of these streets, excepting south 60th street. This grading was the initial improvement of these streets, the first change from the natural contour of the ground. Just before the heavy rains of November, the grading of K street had been completed; and between 60th and 59th streets, it had been necessary to raise the level of the street and sidewalks a little above the natural surface. At the same time, and as a part of the same work, the alley between blocks 3 and 4 was correspondingly raised. There was, therefore, a fill, variously estimated at from a foot to two feet, in the alley in the rear of appellant\\\\u2019s lots. This grading of the street and alley filled the ditch\\'in the alley and stopped up the K street end of the ditch on 60th street. At the same time, the city was constructing a storm sewer, from 64th street north along J street to 60th street, and along 60th to K street. \\' The heavy rains stopped the work before it reached K street. It does not appear that this sewer was fully completed from 64th street down to 60th street, but it does appear that the pipes were laid at 60th and J street, and that there was a manhole at 61st street and another at 60th street.\\\\nIn the grading of 61st street, there was a slight cut between K and- J streets, and the surplus dirt-was used in filling the lots in the vacant block 6, abutting on the north side of 61st street. This whole block was filled to about 18 inches above the street. When the heavy rains of November came, the water, following its usual course from the higher ground from the south and east, being arrested by this filling of block 6, collected in 61st street and vicinity forming a pond. A part of the filling on the lots near J street washed away, and some of the water which had collected in 61st street flowed into the unfinished storm sewer, and out again through the manhole at 60th and J street, thence down 60th street onto appellant\\\\u2019s lots, and was there retained by the filled grade of K street and of the alley in the rear of her lots, causing the injury complained of.\\\\nIt is fairly deducible from the whole of the evidence that little if-any\\'more water was thus collected upon appellant\\\\u2019s lots than would have been the case had no water been allowed to collect in 61st street and had no storm sewer been constructed in J street. The water which came from 61st street would simply have collected in the first instance in 60th street and upon the appellant\\\\u2019s lots. It was merely delayed in its progress by the filling in of block 6, and reached appellant\\\\u2019s lots possibly a little later than otherwise by going around the block instead of crossing it diagonally. But even if there was an increase in the amount of water, it has been held not to create a liability unless the water be cast in a concentrated and destructive body upon the land. Davis v. Crawfordsville, 119 Ind. 1, 21 N. E. 449, 12 Am. St. 361; Jordan v. Benwood, 42 West Va. 312, 26 S. E. 266, 57 Am. St. 859, 36 L. R. A. 519; Hume v. Des Moines, 146 Iowa 624, 29 L. R. A. (N. S.) 126; Miller v. Morristown, 47 N. J. Eq. 62, 20 Atl. 61.\\\\nThe real cause of the water collecting upon appellant\\\\u2019s lots was the raising of the grade of K street and the alley back of these lots, which stopped the drains in 60th street and the alley, thus impounding the water. The evidence fairly indicates that, but for this grading, the water would have passed off as formerly. The appellant herself makes this plain. With reference to the old drains in the alley in 60th street and K street, she testified:\\\\n\\\\u201cQ. This is 60th street, as I understand you; what do you call this (referring to Identification A). There was a drain which you say the city made some time down there, and opened it down there in 60th street? A. Yes. Q. Was the ditch in K street at that time the same kind of a drain? A. No, it was a box. Q. Was it open on K, on this side? A. No they covered it up. Q. How far does it run? A. Run down as I understood down to 58th; they had a big ditch down 58th. Q. If it was not for putting that drain in there by somebody by Mr. Wright or somebody, all of this water would have come across your place? A. Yes. Q. So far as that is concerned, that relieved you some? A. Yes, after they graded the street last winter, they put the dirt in here (indicating on Exhibit). Q. That is what you complain of? A. Yes, I complain of them stopping the ditches and the natural drain. Q. Is it not a fact that the natural drain went down across the lots further? A. No, it went through the alley, not through Hadland\\\\u2019s lots at all.\\\\u201d\\\\nIt is now established law in this state that damages cannot be recovered for consequential injuries to private property occasioned by the original grading of streets and alleys. The dedication of streets and alleys to the public use implies an agreement of the dedicator and his successors in interest that the city may establish grades and improve the streets and alleys thereto in aid of such use. Ettor v. Tacoma, 57 Wash. 50, 106 Pac. 478, 107 Pac. 1061; Fletcher v. Seattle, 43 Wash. 627, 86 Pac. 1046, 88 Pac. 843; Laws 1909, p. 151, \\\\u00a7 1 (Rem. & Bal. Code, \\\\u00a7 7815) ; 4 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (5th ed.), \\\\u00a7 1684.\\\\nIt is also the settled doctrine in this state that surface water caused by the falling of rain or the melting of snow, is to be regarded as an outlaw or common enemy against which every proprietor of land may defend himself, even if in consequence of such defense injury result to others. As to surface waters, this court has definitely adopted the rule of the common law, as - distinguished from the contrary rule of the civil law. Cass v. Dicks, 14 Wash. 75, 44 Pac. 113, 53 Am. St. 859; Harvey v. Northern Pac. R. Co., 63 Wash. 669, 116 Pac. 464; Gould, Waters (3d ed.), \\\\u00a7 265; 30 Am. & Eng. Ency. Law (2d ed.), p. 330.\\\\n\\' Erom the adoption by this court without qualification or restriction of these two doctrines, namely, that a municipal corporation is not liable for injuries consequent upon the initial grading and improvement of its streets, and that surface water is a common enemy against which any one may defend himself, arises the corollary that a city is not liable in damages for injuries to private property by the collection of surface water thereon, caused by the initial grading or improvement of its streets and alleys. Injuries resulting from the reasonable exercise of a legal power are consequential, and cannot be made the basis of recovery. Such is the rule in all those jurisdictions which have adopted without modification the common-enemy doctrine of the common law.\\\\n\\\\u201cIn the jurisdictions which adopt the common law rule, it is held that the rule applies fully to municipal or quasi-municipal corporations as to individuals, and that such a corporation does not incur any liability if in the improvement of its streets or highways it prevents the flow of surface water from adjacent lots; and the same has been held true with regard to the improvement of city lots owned by a municipality. On the other hand, it has been held that a landowner may, by erections or obstructions on his own lands, prevent the flowage of surface waters from a highway upon his land.\\\\u201d 30 Am. & Eng. Ency. Law (2d ed.), pp. 331-332.\\\\nSee, also, 4 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (5th ed), \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 1732, 1733; Elliott, Roads & Streets (3d ed.), \\\\u00a7 556; Gould, Waters (3d ed.), \\\\u00a7 269.\\\\nThere is an exception to this rule of nonliability, which, though not indorsed by some of the courts, and which we do not find has often been applied to the initial grading of streets, we nevertheless believe to be sound in any case. A\\' city may not gather np surface water and discharge it upon land in a concentrated volume to the injury of the land without liability, whether the water be such as naturally would have flowed onto the land or not. The reason is that when collected and discharged in considerable volume upon the land at a given point it may erode and wash channels in the land thus becoming very destructive and injurious. Johnson v. White, 26 R. I. 207, 58 Atl. 658, 65 L. R. A. 250, and note to p. 262. The appellant contends that the evidence bi\\\\u2019ings this case within the exception. But we think not. It fails to show that the water was discharged upon the appellant\\\\u2019s lots in a concentrated volume. It escaped from the manhole in the street, and flowed upon the appellant\\\\u2019s land in a diffused form, as it would have done in any event. In such a case, the mere fact that the water was concentrated in its course to appellant\\\\u2019s land does not create a liability which would not otherwise exist. Clay v. St. Albans, 43 West Va. 539, 27 S. E. 368, 64 Am. St. 883.\\\\nThere remains to be considered the question of negligence. It must be conceded that a municipal corporation, like an individual, is liable for injuries resulting from the negligent exercise of legitimate powers. There is no evidence whatever that, on the completion of the storm sewer on J and 60th street and the new drain on K street, they did not furnish adequate drainage for this district, including appellant\\\\u2019s property; nor was there any evidence that, if the improvement had been completed before the rainy season, any injury would have occurred. The evidence does not make a case of improper or negligent final construction, but merely shows a failure to provide adequate temporary drainage during the progress of the work and the delay made necessary by the rainy season. There is no negligence where there is no violation of duty. There was no absolute duty on the part of the city to furnish temporary drainage for appellant\\\\u2019s lots pending the grading and placing of drains in K street and the construction of the storm sewer on J and 60th streets; nor was it bound to do this if it would entail expense or cause any considerable interference with the prosecution of the work of grading the streets after it had been undertaken, or if it was incompatible with the plan of improvement adopted by the city. Nor was the city bound to do this at all, if the appellant had sufficient notice of the contemplated improvement of the streets, and the manner in which the work was to be done, to have enabled her to protect her lots by providing drainage herself, or by filling the lots, as the evidence shows she has since done. The fact that the old temporary ditches had been dug in the ungraded alley and in the ungraded 60th street, either by the city or with its permission, can make no difference. The city did not thereby abdicate its right to establish an initial grade for its streets and fill them to that grade even if in so doing it filled these ditches. Any other view would make the city liable to some one for some inconvenience every time it sought to grade a street for the first time, and thus render the statute nugatory. The rule in such a case which appeals to us as reasonable, and especially as in. consonance with our statute which does not permit recovery for damages for injuries resulting from the reasonable exercise of the power to grade streets for the first time (Rem. & Bal. Code, \\\\u00a7 7815) is declared by the supreme court of Iowa, in a case cited by appellant, as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cThe true rule here, as we understand it, is that, as the city had power to grade and gutter its streets, it is not liable for defective plans, for in adopting them it acts in a judicial capacity. But it is liable if it negligently carries out such plans, or if, without the adoption of any plans, it proceeds in a negligent manner to make embankments or fills, to the injury of an abutting or adjoining proprietor. As applied to the facts of the case, the city was not liable because of its establishment of grades for West Walnut and West Sixteenth streets, because its act in so doing was either legislative or judicial in character; but in bringing the streets to these grades established, it was bound to the exercise of ordinary care and prudence, and if it unnecessarily or negligently filled ditches and drains in West Sixteenth street, and thus cast surface water back upon plaintiff\\\\u2019s lots, without notice to her, and without her knowledge, and without giving her a reasonable time to bring her lots to grade, the city is liable, not because of defective plans, but by reason of negligence in doing a purely ministerial act; that is, of bringing the streets to the established grade, and, in so doing, filling the ditches and drains for the escape of surface water without providing an escape, either temporary or permanent, for the surface water. Moreover, there was evidence tending to show that it so filled the streets as to collect surface water and discharge it upon plaintiff\\\\u2019s lot. As plaintiff had the right to fill her lot by bringing it to the established grade, doubtless defendant was not obliged to provide permanent culverts, drains, or bridges, although that point we do not now decide. If, after her property is brought to grade, such culverts, ditches, or drains should be constructed, a question may then arise as to defendant\\\\u2019s duty in the premises.\\\\u201d Hume v. Des Moines, supra, 29 L. R. A. (N. S.) 127-136.\\\\nThe evidence shows that the appellant had notice of the city\\\\u2019s intention before the old ditches were filled. She says she protested to the city officials, and in fact that she brought suit against the city in an attempt to stop the grading of K street. She made no attempt to protect her lots, either by filling, diking, or by opening.the old drains, which the city would doubtless have permitted after the drain in K street was completed. This was before the rains set in. The evidence sufficiently shows that this would have been permitted, since the city, in about two days after the first accumulation of water, as appellant admits, \\\\u201cdrained it out the best they could,\\\\u201d by digging a ditch in the alley; and in the spring she says, \\\\u201cThey drained it all out and finally put in a box.\\\\u201d The testimony of both the appellant and her husband shows that, neither before the fall rains nor after, did they, themselves do anything whatever, either to protect the property from water or to drain it off after it accumulated. Surface water being a common enemy, they had the same right to protect their property from it as the city had to protect its streets. 4 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (6th ed.), \\\\u00a7 1733.\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is clear that there is no liability on the part of a municipal corporation for not exercising the discretionary or legislative powers it may possess to improve streets, and, as part of such improvement, to construct gutters or provide other means of draining for surface-waters, so as to prevent them from flowing upon the adjoining lots. And even when the work of grading the streets has been entered upon, there is not ordinarily, if ever, any liability to the adjoining owner arising merely from the non-action of the corporation in not providing means for keeping surface-waters from property situate below the established grade of the street. There are, indeed, cases which go further, and assert that there is no such liability where, in making improvements upon streets or elsewhere, authorized by law, surface-waters are purposely turned from one\\\\u2019s own land to that of another,\\\\u2014 from the street directly upon the adjacent property owner.\\\\u201d 4 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (6th ed.), \\\\u00a7 1734.\\\\nIt would be worse than useless to attempt to harmonize the wilderness of decisions from other states on the questions here involved. Some of them follow the common law rule, others the opposite rule of the civil law, and still others a modified form of the one or the other. So far as we are able to discover by a careful reading of the authorities cited by the appellant, they nearly all arose upon a change of an established grade and not upon an initial grading of the street. In none of them was there a statute involved such as we have here. Manifestly they would not apply under the provisions of our statute which expressly limits recovery to injury by changes of grade. Moreover, they differ widely in their facts from the case before us. In view of the \\'statute as construed in Ettor v. Tacoma, supra, and the rule as to surface water as announced in Cass v. Dicks, supra, we are compelled to hold that the evidence here fails to make a prima ;facie case against the city. The judgment is affirmed.\\\\nDunbar, C.

In addition to its salesroom, it occupied the basement underneath for the storage, receiving, checking and shipping of its merchandise. It was a tenant of the premises, the basement of which abuts upon University street. The city maintained a sewer in University street. Radiating from this sewer there was a lateral sewer from and accommodating the premises used by appellant. On March 5, 1917, there was an average heavy rainfall, when the basement became flooded, causing damage to appellant\\\\u2019s goods and merchandise which, together with the cost of removing and cleaning the same, amounted to the alleged sum of $448.56. Charging the city with negligence in maintaining a main sewer on University street inadequate to meet the burden imposed upon it, resulting in the damage referred to, appellant presented to the city its duly verified claim for damages, the rejection of which occasioned this action. The city, by its answer, denied liability, and affirmatively answered, alleging contributory negligence. The case was tried without a jury. At the close of plaintiff\\\\u2019s case, the court granted defendant\\\\u2019s motion for a non-suit. Upon the request of defendant, findings of fact were made, upon which a judgment of dismissal was entered. Plaintiff appeals from the judgment.\\\\nOn the date mentioned, and for some years prior thereto, there was in force an ordinance of the city which, inter alia, provides:\\\\n\\\\u201cAll cellar and basement drains must, when connected to sewer, ... be protected from backwater by backwater valves; said backwater valves must be provided with an air-tight clean-out cover placed immediately above valve, either screwed or bolted in place, capable of being removed for examination or repairs.\\\\u201d Ordinance No. 22,839, \\\\u00a7 32.\\\\nIn the basement there was installed an iron manhole or receiving water tank, some two feet deep and about the same in diameter, narrower at the top, on which was placed, flush with the floor, a latticed circular iron cover having a mesh about two inches square. Within the manhole the intake of the drain pipe formed an elbow, the end of which, turned down and submerged in water when in place, was below the bottom of the stem of the drain pipe, thus forming a trap to prevent odors escaping from the sewer. On the stem of the pipe near the elbow and within the manhole there was constructed a backwater valve and cover as provided by the ordinance of the city. The drain pipe ran into a larger one from the building and thence into the University street main sewer. The water that flooded the basement poured back boiling out of the manhole.\\\\nIt is the contention of appellant that the incapacity of the main sewer alone caused the flooding, while the respondent claims the backwater valve had been allowed to become unclean and clogged by the fault-of appellant, thus causing the flooding and damage. The trial court found the main sewer inadequate, to which the city took no exception, and also found the appellant negligent in not keeping the backwater valve clean and in proper repair, to which appellant excepted. There is no testimony to show the backwater valve was structurally insufficient or out of repair.\\\\nThere was ample testimony by the head janitor, superintendent, and assistant superintendent of the building, and by E. M. Barstow, manager of appellant\\\\u2019s mercantile business in Seattle, all of whom witnessed the flooding, to justify the finding that all the water which caused the damage backed up from the street sewer through the drain pipe and manhole into the basement.\\\\nOn the other hand, O. A. Davis, appellant\\\\u2019s witness, a plumber and member of the firm that put in the plumbing, testified in detail as to its construction and operation, using a backwater valve to illustrate and explain its proper purpose and functions. It appears the backwater valve consisted of a solid door which hung vertically inside the drain pipe from a hinge, and when undisturbed rested against the surface of a circular collar or shoulder. Water escaping from the basement through the manhole and drain pipe would have no trouble in causing the door of the backwater valve to yield, while wafer backing up the drain pipe would force the door of the backwater valve against the shoulder and thus prevent the further passage of water, assuming always there is no debris or trash to clog the proper operation of the door of the backwater valve. The plumber stated that, if the door to the valve were free, backwater from the sewer could not pass \\\\u2014 the harder the pressure from that direction all the better, if possible, to prevent the backwater from passing. Appellant attempted to meet the force of this testimony by showing the basement floor was cleaned at-the end of each day\\\\u2019s work; but considering the manner in which the backwater valve was constructed, and the further fact that there was no fine screen over either the manhole or the intake of the drain pipe, nor other device to prevent debris from getting into the valve, the flooding backward from the sewer is explainable on no reasonable theory other than that the door to the valve had been rendered useless by reason of carelessness in permitting waste matter to get into and clog the door of the backwater .valve.\\\\nCounsel for appellant also contends that a part of the flood water or sewage came back into the basement through the toilet. We do not so understand the proof. The rear of the basement was fifteen inches higher than that where the flood occurred. The toilet was situated in the rear basement, but all the witnesses who testified on this point said the damage was done by water pouring back through the manhole in the lower basement. The evidence does not show how the plumbing was constructed from the toilet into the sewer. One witness only, E. C. Barstow, testified there was backwater through the toilet, but the record shows that, later in the trial, when another witness was being examined with reference to this, Mr. Bar-stow, to clear np some apparent confusion, stated to the court: \\\\u201cWater came from the toilet but did no damage in the basement. This damage all came through the manhole.\\\\u201d Counsel for appellant argues that Mr. Barstow was not testifying when the statement was made. Appellant is bound by the statement, however, as an admission during trial, for Mr. Barstow was general manager for appellant in the conduct of the business which had suffered the loss, and was such manager and agent at the time of the trial.\\\\nThe finding of negligence against the respondent is unchallenged. The evidence preponderates in support of the finding of contributory negligence on the part of the appellant. The two acts of negligence concurring and co-operating constituted the proximate cause or occasion of the damage complained of, thus precluding a recovery. Franklin v.

Art Strand Floor Coverings, Inc., Appellant.\"],\"opinions\":[{\"text\":\"Rosellini, J.\\\\nThe respondent, Florence Frisken, is the owner of a building in Shelton, Washington, occupied by her tenant, Mell Chevrolet Company. On November 20, 1952, she entered into an agreement with the appellant, a corporation engaged in the business of selling and laying floor coverings, whereby the latter contracted to furnish and install grease-proof asphalt-tile flooring in the showroom and office of the respondent\\\\u2019s building.\\\\nPrior to the submission of the appellant\\\\u2019s bid, its president, Arthur E. Strand, examined the floors of the showroom and office, which were of concrete covered with magnesite, and recommended a tile which would meet the respondent\\\\u2019s needs. The appellant\\\\u2019s bid was accepted, and by December 3, 1952, the installation was completed.\\\\nWithin a week or ten days after the flooring was laid, it was observed that a dark sticky substance was oozing up between the tiles. On the strength of the appellant\\\\u2019s assurance that the condition was temporary and would disappear in a few weeks, the respondent paid for the flooring.\\\\nWhen the oozing or sloughing continued after six weeks had elapsed, complaint was made again, but it appears that nothing was done to correct the condition. Eventually the magnesite beneath the tile grew spongy and caused the floor to rise in spots, resulting in an uneven surface and cracks in the tile. Agents of the appellant inspected the floor and reported that the magnesite was crumbling and falling apart. Still nothing was done to repair or remedy the condition, and after it had continued for more than a year, this action was commenced to recover upon an alleged breach of an implied warranty of fitness.\\\\nAt the conclusion of the trial, the court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a judgment in favor of the respondent.\\\\nWhile the appellant admits that the flooring is not satisfactory for the purpose for which it was intended, it contends that (1) the defects were caused by factors beyond its control, and that the implied warranty of fitness does not cover such defects, or (2) if there was a breach of warranty, the defect was waived when the respondent paid for the installation.\\\\nThe defense of waiver was not pleaded, and the appellant did not request a finding that the respondent had waived the defect. As we have often said, this court will not consider a theory which was not passed upon by the trial court and is presented for the first time on appeal. Muck v. Snohomish County Public Utility Dist., 41 Wn. (2d) 81, 247 P. (2d) 233 (1952); Smith v. King County, 28 Wn. (2d) 917, 184P. (2d) 562 (1947).\\\\nThe facts as found by the trial court do not establish a waiver, since payment was made after the appellant had given its assurance that the sloughing would disappear, a fact which negatives any implication of an intent to waive the defect. Furthermore, the full extent of the damage did not appear until several months after payment was made. The fact that the respondent had paid for the flooring would not deprive her of her right to recover for a breach of which she neither knew nor had reason to know at the time. See Eliason v. Walker, 42 Wn. (2d) 473, 256 P. (2d) 298 (1953), a case in which the plaintiffs, purchasers of a heating system, elected to rescind the contract after the equipment had been paid for and had been in operation for three months. We held that the delay did not constitute a waiver of their right to rescind for breach of warranty, since the inadequacy of the heating system was not established until it had been in operation for some time.\\\\nWe turn now to the appellant\\\\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in finding a breach of warranty. According to the findings, the respondent advised the appellant that an attractive floor was needed because the room was to be used for display purposes; she relied upon the skill and judgment of the appellant\\\\u2019s agent, who represented to her that the appellant could and would install a floor which would satisfy her needs. The floor, the trial court found, was entirely unsatisfactory. It concluded that there had been a breach of the implied warranty of fitness imposed under Rem. Rev. Stat., \\\\u00a7 5836-15 [cf. RCW 63.04.160], which provides in part as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201c (1) Where the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required, and it appears that the buyer relies on the seller\\\\u2019s skill or judgment (whether he be the grower or manufacturer or not), there is an implied warranty that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe appellant argues that there was no competent evidence that the unsatisfactory condition was caused by faulty installation, and it is the custom of contractors not to warrant that magnesite flooring will not deteriorate and damage tile which is laid over it; therefore, there could be no implied warranty of fitness. In regard to the latter contention, there was scant evidence of such a general custom; the trial court made no finding that a custom existed, and none was requested. This facet of the argument is consequently without merit.\\\\nThe respondent\\\\u2019s expert witness, to whose qualifications the appellant made no objection, testified that the sloughing and unevenness was caused by moisture coming up through the magnesite, and that the \\\\u201csweating\\\\u201d could have been avoided by the use of a sealer. The appellant\\\\u2019s expert witnesses testified that there is no sealer which can prevent this sweating, and that it occurs where no barrier has been erected beneath the magnesite or concrete; that there is nothing which can be done to prevent the occurrence once the magnesite and concrete have been improperly laid. The record contains no finding on this precise point, and apparently the trial court did not consider it controlling. Assuming that the fact was established, this in itself does not relieve the appellant of liability.\\\\nWhile the appellant\\\\u2019s president testified that he did not and could not have anticipated the condition which developed, he stated that the magnesite was tested for moisture before the tile was laid. The inescapable inference is that he knew of the possibility that moisture would rise through the magnesite and damage the tile. Furthermore, another of appellant\\\\u2019s witnesses, also a flooring contractor, testified that, unless a water barrier is installed, magnesite has a tendency to sweat and cause discoloration of the tile, and that it is customary to warn the purchaser of this possibility. In this instance, no inquiry was made to ascertain whether a water barrier had been installed, and the respondent was not advised of the risk involved.\\\\nNo error is assigned to the court\\\\u2019s finding that the appellant was familiar with climatic conditions in the area and knew the location of the floor with reference to the ground level as well as the nature and composition of the subflooring. Knowing or being charged with knowledge that there was a risk involved, of which respondent was obviously ignorant, and having failed to warn her of this risk before she made her investment, the appellant must be held to have warranted that the floor would be fit for the intended use regardless of the structure of the underflooring. It is the respondent\\\\u2019s ignorance of the nature and characteristics of floorings which establishes her reliance on the appellant\\\\u2019s skill and judgment. Had the deterioration of the tile resulted from some latent defect in the underflooring which the appellant could not have anticipated, or which the respondent as well as the appellant might have anticipated, a different question would be presented.\\\\nThe view we take is in accord with our holding in Columbia Concrete Pipe Co. v. Knowles, 36 Wn. (2d) 602, 219 P. (2d) 557 (1950). The defendant in that case, a farmer in eastern Washington, had contracted with the plaintiff for the purchase and installation of a pipe line which would irrigate certain designated portions of his farm. It was agreed that the defendant would dig the ditch for the pipe line, which he proceeded to do. The plaintiff\\\\u2019s agents, knowing that the ditch was probably too shallow, nevertheless laid the pipe, which soon sprang a number of leaks and proved to be unsatisfactory. Had the pipe been laid at the proper depth, it appeared that the leaks would not have occurred. We held that subdivision (1) of Rem. Rev. Stat., \\\\u00a7 5836-15, was applicable, and that the defendant, having made known to the plaintiff the purpose for which the pipe line was to be used and having relied upon the plaintiff\\\\u2019s skill and judgment, was entitled to recover on his cross-complaint for a breach of an implied warranty of fitness.\\\\nAs we said in Lundquist v. Coca Cola Bottling, Inc., 42 Wn. (2d) 170, 254 P. (2d) 488 (1953), it is not necessary to prove negligence in order to recover for a breach of an implied warranty. The plaintiff must allege and prove: first, that he made known to the seller, either expressly or by implication, the particular purpose for which the article was required, and second, that it appeared that he relied upon the seller\\\\u2019s skill and judgment when he purchased the article. Under the rule of Columbia Concrete Pipe Co. v. Knowles, supra, if the seller undertakes to install the purchased item, he impliedly warrants that, after installation, it will be fit for the use intended. Of course, the seller may disclaim such a warranty, or the circumstances may negative reliance; but there is no evidence of a disclaimer here, and there is no question but that the respondent relied upon the appellant\\\\u2019s superior skill and judgment, and that the appellant was made aware of this fact.\\\\nAs we have construed the statute, the facts of this case fall within its provisions.\\\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\\\nHamley, C.

Les Rowland Constr., Inc., et al., Respondents.\"],\"opinions\":[{\"text\":\"Rosellini, J.\\\\nThis is an inverse condemnation action which the trial court dismissed on motions of the defendants for summary judgment.\\\\nThe action was commenced by the owner of 61.3 acres of unplatted land in Steilacoom, Washington. The theory of the action, as settled upon after several pretrial conferences, was that the defendants, the Town of Steilacoom and County of Pierce, had, in approving plans for storm drainage facilities to be constructed by land developers in conjunction with subdivision plats of lands lying east of the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land, effected a taking or damaging of its property. The taking or damaging allegedly resulted from the fact that storm sewers and ditches which were constructed pursuant to the plans, carried onto the plaintiff\\\\u2019s lands more water than would have naturally reached the land and deposited it in a manner different from the natural flow.\\\\nAffidavits which were before the court upon the defendants\\\\u2019 motions for summary judgment showed that there was upon the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land a natural swamp into which surface waters from all of the platted areas naturally drained. A natural watercourse flowed from the northern side of this swamp, over a rim or bluff, down through the town and into Puget Sound. The flow of water was controlled by the superintendent of utilities for the Town of Steilacoom, so that the water in the swamp was maintained at the level at which it had stood prior to the development of the subdivisions.\\\\nIt was the allegedly limited capacity of this watercourse which concerned the plaintiff\\\\u2019s expert engineer, who stated in his affidavit that, while the watercourse had a sufficient capacity to carry all the water which would have been drained from the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land if he had drained it and developed it, provided the lands to the east had remained in their natural condition, it did not have sufficient capacity to drain the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land and carry away the water which was brought to it from the developed lands above. He stated that the watercourse could handle the waters carried to the plaintiff\\\\u2019s lands by the storm drainage facilities only if the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land was used as a holding basin.\\\\nThis engineer\\\\u2019s affidavit stated that the subdivision and development of the platted lands had created a runoff of surface water that made storm drainage necessary. It further stated that prior to the development of the platted lands, surface water that might otherwise have collected by reason of rains was dissipated by evaporation, transpiration, and percolation into the ground. It declared:\\\\nThe removal of timber and undergrowth, and the substitution of streets, driveways, homes, and the like, changes the character of the land to such an extent that the subdeveloper must anticipate that 30%, or more, of any rainfall will be carried away by storm drainage facilities\\\\n9. If no waters were carried to the plaintiff\\\\u2019s lands by the storm drainage systems of the Town of Steilacoom and Pierce County, Washington, the plaintiff\\\\u2019s lands could be entirely drained by a ditch or pipe connecting the lowest elevations of the land with the natural watercourse which begins in the westerly portion of the plaintiff\\\\u2019s lands.\\\\nThis affidavit showed that surface waters collected within the platted lands was discharged upon the plaintiff\\\\u2019s lands through five outlets, either ditches or pipes, and that at each outlet ditches were extended onto the plaintiff\\\\u2019s lands.\\\\nThe defendants\\\\u2019 affidavits showed that water from all the lands in question naturally drained into the swamp on the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land, that no new sources of water had been diverted from their natural flow into the storm sewer system, and that the water table in the swamp had remained the same before and after the development of the platted lands.\\\\nAn affidavit of a real estate appraiser filed on behalf of the plaintiff, stated that the market value of the land had been adversely affected by reason of the fact that surface water was being collected and discharged upon the land from storm sewers.\\\\nThe trial court was of the apparent view that the uncontradicted statement in the defendants\\\\u2019 affidavits that the water level had not risen in the swamp, was proof that the amount of water discharged upon the land from the storm sewer system was not greater than the amount which had drained there naturally before the platted lands were developed. While it recognized that the defendants had trespassed upon the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land to construct ditches for the channeling of the water, it was of the apparent opinion that any damage resulting was of a temporary nature and not compensable in this action.\\\\nA municipality ordinarily is not liable for consequential damages occurring when it increases the flow of surface water onto an owner\\\\u2019s property if the damages arise wholly from changes in the character of the surface produced by the opening of streets, building of houses, and the like, in the ordinary and regular course of the expansion of the municipality. On the other hand, it is liable if, in the course of an authorized construction, it collects surface water by an artificial channel or in large quantities and pours it, in a body, upon the land of a private person, to his injury. Under this rule, while municipal authorities may pave and grade streets and are not ordinarily liable for an increase in surface water naturally falling on the land of a private owner where the work is properly done, they are not permitted to concentrate and gather such water into artificial drains or channels and throw it on the land of an individual owner in such manner and volume as to cause substantial injury to such land and without making adequate provision for its proper outflow, unless compensation is made. 18 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \\\\u00a7 53.144, at 538 (3d ed. rev. 1963). See Noyes v. Cosselman, 29 Wash. 635, 70 P. 61 (1902). Surface waters may not be artificially collected and discharged upon adjoining lands in quantities greater than or in a manner different from the natural flow thereof. Colella v. King County, 72 Wn.2d 386, 433 P.2d 154 (1967); King County v. Boeing Co., 62 Wn.2d 545, 384 P.2d 122 (1963). At the same time, it is the rule that the flow of surface water along natural drains may be hastened or incidentally increased by artificial means, so long as the water is not ultimately diverted from its natural flow onto the property of another. Laurelon Terrace, Inc. v. Seattle, 40 Wn.2d 883, 246 P.2d 1113 (1952). ^\\\\nHere it is not contended that there has been any diversion of waters from the direction in which they would naturally flow and onto the land of plaintiff. There is, however, a contention that the amount of water has been increased, as a result of the changes in the surface of the soil effected with the approval of the defendants, and there has been a change in the manner of flow, which have resulted in damage to the plaintiff. The affidavit of the plaintiff\\\\u2019s engineer supports both of these contentions. The mere fact that the plaintiff\\\\u2019s engineer does not dispute the fact that the water table in the swamp has not risen does not settle the question whether the amount of water reaching the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land has increased. The defendants\\\\u2019 affidavits show that the water table is deliberately maintained by their agent, who controls the amount of water flowing from the natural watercourse on the west side of the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land. Thus if there is a greater amount of water reaching the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land, the extra water is being drained off by the defendants\\\\u2019 agent.\\\\nHowever, as we-understand the plaintiff\\\\u2019s theory, it is not so much the increased amount of water reaching its land which has caused the drainage problem as it is the fact that the water is being delivered more swiftly and in large amounts rather than in the slow diffuse manner in which it traveled when the platted lands were in their natural state.\\\\nUnder the rules which we have noted, the mere fact that the amount of water reaching the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land, by reason of the development of the platted lands, might be greater than it formerly was, would not entitle it to compensation for any resulting damage. But the fact that the water is collected and deposited upon the land in a different manner does afford a basis for relief, if resulting damage can indeed be proved to the satisfaction of the trier of the facts.\\\\nThis is not a case where the municipality has collected water and directed it into a natural waterway, as in Strickland v. Seattle, 62 Wn.2d 912, 385 P.2d 33 (1963), where we denied recovery to a riparian owner who complained that in collecting water in ditches and sewers and directing it into a natural watercourse, the city had increased the velocity and turbulence of the stream and the rate of flow of silt, with the result that a delta was being built up in the land at the end of the stream.\\\\nThe allegation that the manner in which the water is deposited upon the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land affects the ability to drain that land, may be difficult to prove to the trier of the facts but it is a material question at issue in the case, and not one upon which summary judgment could properly be granted.\\\\nCertainly the ditching done upon the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land is compensable, if it has in fact resulted in damage. Whether it is regarded as a trespass, temporary in nature, or an appropriation of easements across the plaintiff\\\\u2019s lands to carry the water on its way to its ultimate destination, the necessary parties are before the court and there is no reason to relegate the plaintiff to another action to have its rights determined. See Civil Rule for Superior Court 18.\\\\nWe find in the record some acknowledgement on the part of the defendants that they should have made provision for the proper outflow of the water to a natural watercourse, when they gathered the water into artificial drains and cast it upon the land in a manner different from that by which it would have reached the land in its natural state. We think such a duty is in harmony with the cases which we have cited above, if in fact the manner in which the water is collected and directed onto the land has resulted in damage, a question to be determined by the trier of the facts.\\\\nIn considering a motion for summary judgment, the court must consider all evidence and all reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party and summary judgment will be granted only if reasonable men could reach only one conclusion. Meissner v. Simpson Timber Co., 69 Wn.2d 949, 421 P.2d 674 (1966). The plaintiff offered evidence that his land had been damaged as a result of the collecting and discharge of surface waters upon his land in an unnatural manner. He claimed a large amount of damage and may be able to prove only a minimum; nevertheless, he should have his day in court.\\\\nWhen the first of the 18 subdivisions which are involved in this litigation was platted, and prior to its approval by the Town of Steilacoom, the developer secured from the plaintiff\\\\u2019s two controlling stockholders (who admit that it is their alter ego) a release whereby the owners consented to\\\\nthe natural flow of surface water from said plat to be carried in its natural channel across the property of the [owners] and to hold the Town of Steilacoom blameless for any damage that may be caused by said drainage flow\\\\nThe trial court held that this docupient released the Town of Steilacoom from any liability for damage resulting from the flow of waters from the other 17 subdivisions, as well as the first.\\\\nThis document does not purport to pertain to any plat other than the one which was then under consideration, to which reference was made therein. Furthermore, it does not purport to authorize the collecting of water by artificial means and depositing of it upon the land of the plaintiff. It was drawn by the town and must be construed against it. We do not find the release broad enough in its terms to preclude this action.\\\\nThe judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.\\\\nHale, C.J., and Finley, Hunter, Hamilton, Stafford, Wright, Utter, and Brachtenbach, JJ., concur.\\\\nPetition for rehearing denied August 9, 1974.\",\"type\":\"majority\",\"author\":\"Rosellini, J.\"}],\"attorneys\":[\"Kane, Vandeberg & Hartinger, by Harold T.

Spokane & Eastern Trust Company, Appellant, T. H. Gowman, Defendant.\"],\"opinions\":[{\"text\":\"Parker, J.\\\\nThis action was commenced by the plaintiff to recover damages claimed to have resulted to it from the negligent maintenance by the defendants, Spokane & Eastern Trust Company and T. H. Gowman, its tenant, of a water pipe in the upper story of a building owned by the trust company, and negligently permitting the pipe to burst from freezing, thereby causing a large quantity of water to be precipitated upon the goods of the plaintiff in its store, occupying the ground floor of the building. A trial resulted in verdict and judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant trust company, and exonerating the defendant \\' Gowman. The trust company has appealed.\\\\nThe clothing company occupied the ground floor and basement of the building under a lease as a tenant of the trust company, while Gowman occupied the entire second floor of the building under a lease as tenant of the trust company. Both tenants had been in the occupancy of their respective leased premises for several years. These were entirely separate tenancies. In so far as the right of either tenant to go upon or interfere with the premises leased by the other, such right was no different than as if each occupied a separate building under their respective leases. The provisions of the leases do not call for any particular notice here, except possibly the following provision found in each of them:\\\\n\\\\u201cAnd the said party of the second part [the tenant] does covenant and agree with the said party of the first part, its successors and assigns, that the said party of the second part shall and will make all interior repairs to said rooms during the life of this lease and without any cost to the party of the first part.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe building is situated at 716, Riverside avenue, in Spokane, being on the northerly side of that avenue. It is but two stories high in addition to its basement. It is not supplied with heat other than such as the respective tenants supplied for themselves. The second floor was occupied by Gowman and wife with a photograph gallery and their living rooms, and also by a dentist who was a subtenant of Gowman. Water was supplied to the second floor through a pipe which ran from the avenue into the basement and up through the clothing company\\\\u2019s store on its westerly wall, some distance back from the avenue, passing into a toilet room on the second floor, situated near the middle of that floor on the westerly side of a hallway running north and south. In the basement, there was a cut-off in the pipe leading to the upper floor by which the water could be entirely shut off from that floor. From the toilet on the upper floor, a pipe ran under the floor of the hallway to a sink in the room on the east side of the hall. This room was included in Gowman\\\\u2019s tenancy, though seemingly unoccupied, save possibly as a storeroom. The pipe leading to the sink in this room had a cut-off near the bowl in the toilet room. Whether reasonable inspection by Gowman under the circumstances would have disclosed to him the fact that this pipe carried water across the hall to the sink, and that the water could have been cut off therefrom by this cut-off, is one of the principal controverted questions touching both his and the trust company\\\\u2019s negligence. The damage occurred from the bursting by freezing of this pipe at a point near the sink in this room, on the east side of the hall, during a very cold night in January, when such freezing and bursting of the pipe might have been anticipated with the water left in it, and might have been prevented by the use of the cut-off in the toilet room. Another pipe ran under the floor of the hall into the dental rooms at the front of the building. There was a cut-off in this pipe under the floor of the hall nearly opposite the sink in the room to the east of the hall. Gowman claims that he thought this cut-off could be used to stop the flow of water to the sink as well as to the dental rooms. This cut-off was accessible by raising a loose board left for that purpose over it in the floor of the hall.\\\\nDuring the evening of the night when the bursting of the pipe at the sink occurred, Gowman, deeming it a necessary precaution because of the intense cold, turned the cut-off in the hall floor to stop the flow of water, as he had often done during previous cold .spells. Gowman testified, in substance, that, when he went into possession of the upper floor under his lease, the cut-off in the floor of the hall was called to his attention by the agent of the trust company and that the agent then requested him \\\\u201cto see that this shut-off was shut off during cold weather, to prevent any freezing of the water in the dental rooms;\\\\u201d also, that other cut-offs in the upper floor were then called to his attention but the one in the toilet room was not then mentioned; though we may assume, for argument\\\\u2019s sake, that Gowman knew it was there. He also testified, in substance, that there was nothing to indicate that the pipe supplying the sink in the room to the east of the hall came from the toilet room. Two experienced plumbers testified, in substance, that the cut-off in the toilet room was simply such as are usually installed in such places to enable repairs to be made to toilets and that there was nothing, so far as the outward appearance of the plumbing was concerned, to indicate that the pipe leading to the sink came from the toilet room or that the cut-off therein controlled the flow of water to the sink, but that from outward appearances, the cut-off under the hall floor seemed to be the one to check the flow of water to the sink, though, as demonstrated by the freezing and bursting of the pipe here involved, that was not the fact. The trial court submitted to the jury a special interrogatory, which it answered and returned with its verdict, as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cDid the defendant Gowman, under all the circumstances of this case, at and immediately prior to the time of the alleged freezing and bursting of the water pipe, act as an ordinary prudent man would have acted relative to the water pipe? Ans. Yes.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe principal contention made by counsel for the trust company is that the trial court erred in refusing to dispose of the cause in its favor as a matter of law upon its motions for nonsuit, for instructed verdict, and for judgment nothwithstanding the verdict. It is argued that the trust company was entitled to have the cause so disposed of, (1) because of failure of proof showing any negligence on the part of the trust company; and (2) because the evidence conclusively showed that whatever damage the clothing company suffered was the result of its own negligence. We will notice these in order.\\\\nWas there sufficient evidence to sustain the jury\\\\u2019s conclusion that the trust company\\\\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of the damage? We ignore, for the present, the question of the clothing company\\\\u2019s contributory negligence. Had the trust company been in the actual occupancy of the second floor as owner, instead of such occupancy being by its tenant Gowman, it seems to us there would be but little room for serious argument in defense of the trust company, in view of the well recognized necessity of taking precautions against the bursting of water pipes by freezing and the means readily at hand on that floor to exercise such precaution. The trust company actually knew of the cut-off in the floor of the hall, and in the absence of evidence showing to the contrary, we think the jury were warranted in believing that the trust company also knew that the cut-off in the toilet room would stop the flow of water to the sink; the placing of the pipe leading from the toilet to the sink in the store room being before Gowman\\\\u2019s tenancy commenced, and done presumably at the instance of the trust company, the owner of the building. Now, if all this knowledge of the trust company, which we conclude the jury were warranted in believing it possessed, touching the means at hand for cutting off the water to prevent freezing, had been in possession of Gowman, counsel for the trust company might well argue that it was Gowman\\\\u2019s negligence in not shutting off the water flowing to the sink which was the proximate cause of the damage. But it was the duty of the trust company, as owner of the building, to inform Gowman of the means provided by it to shut off the water flowing to the sink, either by specific directions, as it did relative to the cut-off in the hall floor, and other cut-offs upon Gowman\\\\u2019s leased premises, or by having the plumbing so constructed in its building as to render it apparent to Gowman upon reasonable inspection that the cut-off in the toilet room would stop the flow of water to the sink. In view of the apparent condition of the plumbing, indicating, as testified to by the plumbers, that the cut-off in the hall would stop the flow of water to the sink as well as the flow to the dental rooms, and the other circumstances the evidence tends to show, we think the jury was justified in malting their special finding which, in effect, exonerated Gowman from all negligence in his failure to cut off the flow of water to the sink by the use of the cut-off in the toilet room, and that the negligence of the trust company induced Gowman to so act, and thus became, as we think the jury could rightfully conclude, the proximate cause of the damage. Among the decisions called to our notice dealing with the negligence of tenants on upper floors causing damages to those on lower floors, the following are of interest: Lederer v. Fox, 151 Ill. App. 300; McCarthy v. York County Sav. Bank, 74 Me. 315, 43 Am. Rep. 591; Allen v. Smith, 76 Me. 335; Kenny v. Barns, 67 Mich. 336, 34 N. W. 587; Lebensburger v. Scofield, 155 Fed. 85, 12 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1025, and note.\\\\nThese decisions, however, turn upon the question of the negligence of the upper tenant, and are of but little aid here, in view of the jury\\\\u2019s finding exonerating Gowman, the upper tenant, from negligence, which finding, we conclude, was justified by the evidence. The following decisions are of interest touching the question of a landlord\\\\u2019s negligence in allowing water to escape in upper stories under his control, thereby causing damage to his tenant\\\\u2019s goods occupying a lower story: Priest v. Nichols, 116 Mass. 401; Freidenburg Co. v. Jones, 63 Ga. 612; and our own recent decision in LeVette v. Hardman Estate, 77 Wash. 320, 137 Pac. 454.\\\\nThese decisions, however, cannot be said to be directly in point upon the exact question here involved, nor has any decision come to our notice which can be said to be exactly in point. We think, however, the logic of the decisions above noticed, relating to negligence of tenants and landlords controlling upper floors resulting in damage to tenants occupying lower floors, support the conclusion that the facts of this case warranted the jury in finding that the negligence of the trust company was the proximate cause of the injury here complained of in that such negligence resulted in Gowman\\\\u2019s failure to shut off the water flowing in the pipe to the sink. Our attention has been called to Buckley v. Cunningham, 103 Ala. 449, 15 South. 826, 49 Am. St. 42. That decision, however, in so far as it may be regarded as applicable to this situation, is seemingly not in harmony with our views expressed in Le Vette v. Hardman Estate, supra.\\\\nWas the evidence such as to enable the court to determine, as a matter of law, that the clothing company\\\\u2019s contributory negligence was the proximate cause of the damage suffered? We think not. It is true, there was, in the basement occupied by the clothing company, a cut-off which would, if used, have stopped the flow of water to the entire upper floor. The failure of the clothing company to stop this flow of water to the upper floor and thereby prevent freezing, by the use of this cut-off, is claimed to be the principal act of contributory negligence on its part. We have seen that the tenancies were entirely separate.\\' It seems quite clear to us that the clothing company would have no more right to turn this cut-off and stop the flow of water to the upper floor than it would to go off its own leased premises and stop the flow of water to that floor. That pipe and the water flowing through it, while upon the clothing company\\\\u2019s leased premises, was not for its use, and was no more a part of its leased premises than as if it had been, in fact, physically off such premises. The argument amounts in substance to this; that the clothing company did not anticipate the negligence of those who were in control of, or responsible for, the taking of proper precaution to prevent the freezing and bursting of water pipes on the upper floor, which floor, we have noticed, was no part of the premises leased by the clothing company. While it may be contributory negligence under some circumstances not to anticipate fault in others, yet it cannot be said, as a matter of law, that it was so on the part of the clothing company under the circumstances here shown. Thompson, Negligence, \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 190, 191. The clothing company had occupied the ground floor and basement of this building for a number of years. It had manifestly never had occasion to anticipate that proper precaution would not be taken by those in control of the upper floor to prevent freezing and bursting of the water pipes on that floor; though it is apparently conceded that, in the climate of Spokane, in a building such as this, without any other heat than such as the tenants themselves furnished, it was necessary, during the winter months, to take such precautions. We have had occasion to deal with the question of damages occurring upon leased premises as between the landlord and the tenant of the particular premises upon which the claimed negligence occurred, in Howard v. Washington Water Power Co., 75 Wash. 255, 134 Pac. 927, and Mesher v. Osborne, 75 Wash. 439, 134 Pac. 1092. This, however, is not a case of the clothing company exercising the proper control and care over its own leased premises, but, so far as its contributory negligence is concerned, it becomes a question of its anticipating the negligence of others upon premises which it did not occupy.\\\\nSome contention is made rested upon the duty of these tenants, to wit, the clothing company and Gowman, to make \\\\u201cinterior repairs\\\\u201d upon their respective leased premises as provided in their leases. We are unable, however, to see that this provision touches any duty of the clothing company as to needed repairs upon Gowman\\\\u2019s premises, defective condition of plumbing therein, or negligence on the part of Gowman or the trust company in failing to properly control the water on that floor, in view of the fact that the respective tenancies were entirely separate and independent of each other. We think what we have said disposes, in substance, of the numerous assignments of error made by counsel for the trust company, and that further discussion is not called for.\\\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\\\nFullerton, Morris, and Mount, JJ., concur.\",\"type\":\"majority\",\"author\":\"Parker, J.\"}],\"attorneys\":[\"David Herman and W.

The negligence of a landlord of a two-story building, the different floors of which were leased to separate tenants, in failing to prevent the pipes from freezing and flooding the lower story, is a question for the jury, where there was evidence that one cut-off for that purpose was so located as not to attract the attention of the upper tenant, in the exercise of reasonable care, and that the landlord did not point it out to him, so that the upper tenant was not guilty of negligence in failing to discover it and shut off the water.\\\\nSame \\\\u2014 Contributory Negligence \\\\u2014 Question for Jury. A tenant in a lower story is not guilty of contributory negligence, as a matter of law, preventing a recovery for damages when pipes in the upper story were frozen and burst, flooding the lower premises, from the fact that, in the basement occupied by him, there was a cut-off to the pipe serving the second story which, if used, would stop the flow of water to the upper story; since the pipe was not under his control and he was not bound to anticipate the negligence of the upper tenant in not taking proper precautions to prevent the pipes from freezing.\\\\nSame \\\\u2014 Injury to Tenant\\\\u2019s Goods \\\\u2014 Lease\\\\u2014Effect of Provisions.

Sometime after the commencement of the action, but prior to the time of the trial, the lessors repaired and also repainted the building, and at the hearing before the superior court the lessee conceded that his claim for specific performance had been fully satisfied. The trial therefore proceeded upon the issue of damages alleged to have been sustained by the lessee because of the lessors\\\\u2019 earlier breach of the covenant, in that they had not made the repairs sooner than they did. At the conclusion of the trial, and after taking the cause under advisement, the trial court rendered a memorandum opinion and subsequently entered judgment dismissing the action, but without costs to either party. The plaintiff lessee appealed.\\\\nRespondent lessors are the owners of certain premises situated at the junction of three highways near the city of Renton. On August 16, 1939, they leased the premises, including the building thereon and the equipment therein, to the appellant for use as a restaurant, tavern, and dance hall, for a term of three years beginning October 1, 1939, at a rental of ninety dollars a month. The lease provided that its term of existence could be extended for an additional three-year period at the option of the lessee, on the basis of a monthly rental to be agreed upon by the parties at the end of the original term, and in case of their inability to agree upon the amount of such rental it was to be determined by a committee of three arbitrators.\\\\nThe lease contained a covenant reading as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is further hereby agreed that the lessors shall keep the exterior of the building, namely roof and walls, in proper condition with necessary painting and will also be responsible for any repairs needed in the sewer connections of the said building.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe front wall and one side wall of the building were of stucco composition and the rest of the building presumably was of the ordinary frame construction. The roof was flat, covered with an asphalt top, and was surrounded on three sides by fire walls.\\\\nAt the end of the original three-year term, appellant elected to take an extension of three additional years as provided in the lease, but the parties were unable to agree upon the amount of the monthly rental for the extension period. Respondents were demanding that the rent be increased to one hundred fifty dollars a month; appellant was insisting that it be reduced to fifty dollars. Appellant was operating the place at that time simply as a tavern and dance hall, where beer, wine, and soft drinks were sold and where dances were held two nights a week, but no meals were then being served. It appears also that for some time past appellant had been complaining that the roof of the building leaked and that the exterior needed painting.\\\\nThe parties being unable to come to any satisfactory agreement, three arbitrators were selected, in the manner provided in the lease, to determine the amount of the monthly rental to be charged during the period of the extension. After an inspection of the building, conferences with the respective parties, and a consultation among themselves, the arbitrators made a written report fixing the amount of such rental at one hundred dollars a month. In their report the arbitrators also expressed the view that the lessors had not fully complied with their obligations to the lessee and recommended \\\\u201cthat the landlord fix up the building better than he has in the past; that is fix the roof; and keep the place in repairs.\\\\u201d It appears, however, that shortly before the arbitrators made their report, respondents had put a new asphalt covering on the roof at an expense of one hundred dollars, although they had not done anything in the way of painting during the entire term of the lease.\\\\nPursuant to the report of the arbitrators, the lease was extended and appellant periodically paid the increased rental of one hundred dollars a month. He continued to make complaint, however, regarding the condition of the roof and exterior walls of the building, and respondents endeavored from time to time to make the roof watertight, but did not immediately paint the exterior. Considerable ill-feeling thus seems to have been engendered between the parties, culminating in the institution of this action by the appellant in July, 1943, which was about nine months after the commencement of the extended period of the lease.\\\\nIn his complaint, as amplified by a bill of particulars, appellant alleged that respondents had breached their covenant to repair by allowing the roof of the building to remain in a leaky condition, with the result that in the rainy season water frequently dripped in various spots upon the dance floor and upon the tables in the adjoining booths, to the great discomfort and annoyance of his patrons, and that respondents had further breached their covenant by failing to paint the exterior of the building, in consequence of which the place had a dilapidated appearance, causing many of his customers to discontinue their patronage. The complaint further alleged that the damages resulting from the respondents\\\\u2019 failure to perform the above-mentioned covenant of the lease amounted to \\\\u201capproximately $10.00 per day,\\\\u201d and recovery in that amount was asked. The prayer of the complaint also asked for specific performance of the covenant of the lease. In their answer to the complaint respondents denied in toto appellant\\\\u2019s allegations respecting breach of covenant and consequent damage.\\\\nInasmuch as the action in its inception was a suit in equity for specific performance of the covenant to repair, the trial court was not required to, and did not, make findings of fact. The court did, however, render a memorandum opinion, in which it carefully reviewed and analyzed the evidence and gave a summary of the facts as, in the opinion of the court, they appeared to be established by the evidence. While there is some conflict in the testimony, the material facts are not greatly in dispute. Our view of the factual situation coincides with that expressed by the trial court and may be briefly stated as follows:\\\\nAbout the time of the expiration of the original term of the lease in 1942, a dispute arose between the parties concerning the amount of monthly rent to be charged during the extended term. On account of the outbreak of the present world war and the construction of various government works and other projects in and near Renton, there had been a great influx of people in the immediate vicinity of the premises here involved. For that reason respondents were demanding that the rent for the extended term be increased from ninety dollars a month to one hundred fifty dollars. Appellant, on the other hand, was insisting that the premises were worth not more than fifty dollars a month. Among other reasons given by the appellant for demanding a reduction in rent were the alleged physical condition and appearance of the building. Appellant complained of the shabby appearance of the place due to the fact that the building had not been painted for five or six years. He also complained that the roof leaked in several places, allowing water to drop onto the dance floor and booths at various spots. Respondents endeavored to repair the roof and during the late summer or early fall of 1942 spent about a hundred dollars in that effort, but did not at that time do anything toward having the building painted.\\\\nThe parties being unable to come to any satisfactory agreement, a committee of arbitrators was selected and the matter of rent was submitted to them for decision. After listening to the contentions of both parties and also investigating the premises, the committee on October 13, 1942, made its report fixing the rental for the extended term at one hundred dollars a month and recommending that respondents fix up the building better than they had done in the past, particularly with reference to the roof.\\\\nThroughout the fall and winter of 1942, and the early part of 1943, appellant continued to make complaint that the roof leaked, at times causing water to drip in spots upon the dance floor and upon the tables in the booths. It was testified that on one occasion it was necessary to set out pans to catch the dripping water, and also to move the patrons who were seated at one of the tables to another part of the room. Frequently there were wet spots upon the ceiling and on one of the walls of the building. However, it does not appear that there was ever any actual interruption of appellant\\\\u2019s business, nor was he ever compelled to close the place, even temporarily.\\\\nIn response to appellant\\\\u2019s complaints concerning the roof, respondents endeavored from time to time to remedy the situation. As stated above, just shortly before the arbitrators made their report in October, 1942, respondents had put a new asphalt coating on the roof at an expense of one hundred dollars. Apparently, however, this did not fully terminate the trouble, at least not to the appellant\\\\u2019s entire satisfaction. At any rate he continued to make complaint throughout the latter part of 1942 and the early part of 1943. As these complaints were conveyed to respondent James Zerwoodis, he would visit the premises, most often with one or two assistants, and from the interior of the building would endeavor to locate the place where the roof was leaking. They would then go up onto the roof and make such repairs as seemed necessary in order to correct the situation. After completing the work they would return to the room below to ascertain whether they had succeeded in stopping the leak. This method of attempted repair was carried on many times, particularly during December, 1942, and January, 1943, and apparently with temporary success; but sooner or later another complaint would be made by the appellant. The difficulty seems to have been that of locating the exact place in the roof where the leak, or leaks, originated. The record is replete, however, with\\\\u2019evidence of the respondents\\\\u2019 continuous efforts to satisfy appellant\\\\u2019s complaints with respect to the leaks. There is also considerable evidence in the record from which the trial court could have found, as it seems to have done, that appellant\\\\u2019s complaints were greatly exaggerated.\\\\nAt any rate, sometime in May, 1943, respondents engaged a contractor to inspect and renovate the entire roof and to paint the exterior of the building. The work could not be done, however, and was not done, until about the first of August of that year. In the meantime, appellant had commenced this action.\\\\nIn his memorandum opinion, the trial judge expressed the view that the respondents had carried out the suggestions of the arbitrators with reference to repairs, and had also repainted the building, as soon as weather and labor conditions permitted. A careful reading of the record convinces us that, while some leakage may have persisted during the time when appellant was making complaint thereof, respondents in turn made every reasonable effort to remedy the situation and did in fact accomplish as good results as could have been expected under the circumstances existing during the latter part of 1942 and the early part of 1943. So far as the painting of the exterior is concerned, we are also satisfied that this was undertaken as soon as it could, and should, have been done.\\\\nIn expressing these conclusions, however, we are not to be understood as holding that respondents were not bound by their covenant or would riot now be liable for any damages which may have actually resulted from their breach thereof, regardless of whether or not such breach came about through their willful neglect. On the contrary, we would be constrained to hold that, having covenanted to keep the roof and walls in proper condition, respondents would be liable for any ascertained damages shown to have been the proximate result of their failure to perform the covenant.\\\\nThe trial court seems to have conceded, and we likewise assume from the very nature of the circumstances narrated above, that appellant was damaged to some extent by respondents\\\\u2019 failure to keep the roof in proper condition against leakage. However, the important question in this case, both in the superior court and in this court, was and is not merely whether the appellant has sustained some damage by respondents\\\\u2019 breach of their covenant, but, rather, whether the appellant has established the amount of his alleged damages by the required degree of proof.\\\\nAppellant\\\\u2019s complaint was drawn upon the theory that the measure of his damages was his loss of profits. At the trial, he endeavored at first to establish recovery strictly upon that theory alone, but later changed his position somewhat, to include as an additional measure of recovery the difference between the rental value of the property in the condition required by the covenant of the lease and the value thereof in the condition in which the property actually was at and prior to the time the action was brought. The trial court held that the evidence was insufficient to establish any definite amount of loss with any reasonable degree of accuracy, under either theory of the measure of damages. This appeal presents the question of whether the trial court was correct in its holding.\\\\nWhile there is a diversity of judicial opinion on the question of the measure of damages recoverable by the lessee from the lessor for the latter\\\\u2019s breach of covenant to repair, the decisions are in general accord upon the postulate that the damages recoverable for the breach of such covenant must be such as are the direct, natural, and proximate result of the breach, and such as may reasonably be supposed to have been within the contemplation of the parties at the time they made the contract; and, conversely, that remote, contingent, or speculative damages are not recoverable. 32 Am. Jur. 592, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a7 717; 36 C. J. 165, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a7 801.\\\\nThe most usual rule or measure for assessing a tenant\\\\u2019s damages for breach of his landlord\\\\u2019s covenant to repair or other covenant with respect to the use of property, where there is no claim for, or proof of, special damages, is the difference between the rental value of the property if kept in the condition of repair or utility required by the covenant and the rental value in the condition in which the property actually is. Ingalls v. Beall, 68 Wash. 247, 122 Pac. 1063; Purcell v. Warburton, 70 Wash. 129, 126 Pac. 89; Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co., 102 Wash. 423, 173 Pac. 47; Schermerhorn v. Sayles, 123 Wash. 139, 212 Pac. 156; Yakima Lodge No. 53, K. P. v. Schneider, 173 Wash. 639, 24 P.

R. 1239.\\\\nOn the other hand, where special damages, such as loss of profits, are specifically set forth and proved, the recovery by a tenant, for breach of his landlord\\\\u2019s covenant to repair or other covenant with respect to the use of property, is not restricted to the difference in rental value, as expressed in the foregoing general rule, but may also include such loss of profits as has been directly and necessarily caused by the landlord\\\\u2019s wrongful act or default. In such case, however, the loss must be shown with a reasonable degree of certainty and accuracy, and the proof establishing the loss must be clear and convincing, free from speculation or conjecture. These complementary statements express a rule to which this court is definitely committed. Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co., supra; Schermerhorn v. Sayles, supra; accord: Kohne v. White, 12 Wash. 199, 40 Pac. 794; Cordes v. Guy Inv. Co., 146 Wash. 143, 262 Pac. 131. Other cases illustrating the same principle are: DeHoney v. Gjarde, 134 Wash. 647, 236 Pac. 290; Schultz v. Wells Butchers\\' Supply Co., 151 Wash. 382, 275 Pac. 737; Blakiston v. Osgood Panel & Veneer Co., 173 Wash. 435, 23 P. (2d) 397; Quist v. Zerr, 12 Wn. (2d) 21, 120 P. (2d) 539; Automatic Canteen Co. of Washington v. Automatic Canteen Co. of America, 182 Wash. 133, 45 P. (2d) 41. See, also, 15 Am. Jur. 558, Damages, \\\\u00a7 150.\\\\nThe position taken by this court on this general subject is well illustrated by the case of Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co., supra, which was an action for damages against a landlord for interference with the access of light and ventilation to a storeroom occupied by a tenant. On the question of loss of profits as a measure of damages, the court said:\\\\n\\\\u201cIt may be granted that, in certain cases, a tenant may show a loss of profits in the conduct of an established business where the landlord has unreasonably interfered with the full enjoyment and use of the demised premises. But cases so holding rest in an exception to a general rule, which has twice been declared by this court. Kohne v. White, 12 Wash. 199, 40 Pac. 794; Purcell v. Warburton, 70 Wash. 129, 126 Pac. 89. Interference with light is a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Taylor, Landlord and Tenant, 309(a).\\\\n\\\\u201cThe measure of damages for an interruption of quiet enjoyment by the landlord is the difference between the value of the use of the property as furnished by the landlord and the rent reserved. In other words, it is the diminished value of the use of the property. Tiffany, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a7 79g; Underhill, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a7 432; Taylor, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 177 and 317; 16 R. C. L. 770.\\\\n\\\\u201cLoss of profits are usually regarded as too contingent, remote or speculative to be considered. 16 R. C. L. 1056. The general rule should not be departed from unless it is impossible to measure the losses by it, or the character of the business is such and the proof of the profits so clear that the court can say, as a matter of law, that loss of profits was within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made. If this be so, it will declare lost profits to be the measure of damages. . . .\\\\n\\\\u201cBut if it be held that the loss of usable value is not a proper measure of damages, the exception to the rule allowing a loss of profits should not be allowed in this case, for, in sound reason and under all authority, a loss of profits is not allowed unless they can be measured with a fair degree of accuracy. The testimony must be clear and free from taint of speculation or conjecture. The rule rests in a principle applied in all cases for damages arising out of a sale of property or the use of property.\\\\n\\\\u201cTo sustain a verdict for prospective profits, the jury must have some reasonable basis for estimating the worth of the business. From the nature of things, prospective profits cannot be proved to the dollar. Yet the law does demand that there shall be tangible evidence sufficiently clear and convincing to reasonably sustain a verdict. There must be some standard of comparison.\\\\u201d\\\\nAgain, in DeHoney v. Gjarde, supra, this court said:\\\\n\\\\u201cTrue, this court is committed to the rule that loss of profits may be recovered, but we have said that the loss must be shown with a reasonable degree of accuracy, and that the testimony establishing the loss must be clear and free from taint of speculation or conjecture. [Citing cases.]\\\\u201d\\\\nThe trial court applied these rules to the evidence in the instant case and came to the very emphatic conclusion that appellant had not shown any loss of profits with any reasonable degree of accuracy, but that, on the contrary, his testimony on that subject was at best speculative and conjectural. Our examination of the record leads us just as positively to the same conclusion.\\\\nThere was no showing of the amount of profits that appellant had customarily been making, nor was there any convincing evidence concerning the amount of loss of profits due to the condition of the premises. Appellant testified that the bookkeeper\\\\u2019s receipts showed a loss of ten or eleven dollars a day, but no books were produced in court, nor was any explanation given as to how the loss was computed. Appellant testified that some of his patrons quit coming to his place because of the leaky roof, and others because of the dilapidated appearance of the exterior of the place, but there was nothing definite shown as to how many people quit coming, or when they quit, or how much loss of profits was due to that circumstance. It is further to be noted that appellant claimed that his damages amounted to ten dollars a day, as though the roof was constantly leaking every day and every night. Manifestly, that is not true. It is also to be remembered that dances were held only two nights a week, and it was only on those nights that his patrons could have been discommoded by dripping water while dancing. With respect to loss of profits caused by respondents\\\\u2019 delay in painting the building, the proof is even more meager in extent and less certain as to the amount of loss sustained.\\\\nWe recognize that it would be impossible for appellant to establish his loss of profits with mathematical exactness or absolute certainty, and that consequently the law will not hold him to so strict a requirement, but in any event the burden was upon him to prove his loss with at least such certainty and accuracy as would enable the court to find from the evidence that he had been damaged in a stated amount. A reading of the record convinces us that neither the trial court nor anyone else could say that appellant had sustained a loss of profits in any specific amount whatever.\\\\nThe other measure of damages on which appellant relied for recovery was the alleged diminished rental value of the property. He testified that, because of respondents\\\\u2019 failure to repair and repaint the- building, the rental value of the premises was only fifty dollars a month instead of one hundred dollars, the amount he was required to pay, and did pay, during the period of the extension. Appellant\\\\u2019s qualification to testify on that subject is not shown by the record. Assuming for the sake of argument only, that his status as a tenant qualified him to testify thereon, we are not greatly impressed by his testimony in that respect. The arbitrators themselves had recently fixed the rental value at one hundred dollars a month, although that amount was in the nature of a compromise between the claims of the two parties. Moreover, Mr. Zerwoodis, the owner of the building, testified at the trial that the rental value of the property was one hundred fifty dollars a month, and that he could get that amount for it. His testimony upon that question seems to us to have the greater weight. We conclude, as did the trial court, that the appellant likewise failed to establish, by the required degree of proof, his damages upon the basis of the difference in rental value of the property.\\\\nFinally, appellant contends that, in any event, the trial court erred in refusing to award him nominal damages. That contention is without merit upon the appeal for it is the settled rule in this state that where the sole object of the action is the recovery of damages, the failure to give nominal damages is not ground for reversal of a judgment.

The City of Spokane, Appellant.\"],\"opinions\":[{\"text\":\"Millard, J.\\\\nThis action was brought to recover for damages alleged to have been sustained as a result of the depositing of sewage and water into plaintiff\\\\u2019s basement from a public sewer. The cause was tried to the court, which found that, pursuant to ordinance and regulations of defendant, plaintiff connected his property to appellant\\\\u2019s sewer; that the sewer installation required and approved by defendant was improper; that the sewer was of insufficient capacity to carry off the sewage and water conducted into it; and that, as the proximate result of defendant\\\\u2019s negligence, plaintiff sustained damage in the amount of two hundred and ten dollars, including the expense of fifty-five dollars incurred in the construction of a manhole subsequent to the flooding of the basement. Judgment was entered accordingly. Defendant appealed.\\\\nIt is the position of appellant that an extraordinary storm condition deposited an unusual amount of water in the vicinity of respondent\\\\u2019s property, thereby overtaxing the sewer system, which was reasonably adequate to care for sewage and water reasonably expected to accumulate under ordinary circumstances; and that the contributory negligence of respondent in failing to properly install a back water trap, or check valve, was the proximate cause of the damage and precludes a recovery by respondent.\\\\nThe facts are as follows:\\\\nRespondent owns a building, which was constructed in 1936, located at the northeast corner of Ninth avenue and Perry street, in the city of Spokane. In 1908, appellant installed the Perry street sewer, which is twenty inches in diameter from Seventh avenue to Ninth avenue. A sewer under Ninth avenue empties into the Perry street sewer, the diameter of which at this point is twenty-four inches.\\\\nIt is the duty, under an ordinance of the city of Spokane, of appellant\\\\u2019s health officer, where there is a public sewer in any street, to compel every owner within one hundred and fifty feet of the sewer to install a sufficient drain pipe, which shall connect his property to the nearest sewer. The health officer is also authorized to issue a permit for a cesspool or septic tank on premises in a sewer district, to drain plumbing fixtures or floors too low to be drained into the public sewer; but all other fixtures or floors on the premises are required to be drained through the sewer. The basement of respondent\\\\u2019s property was too low to properly drain to the sewer.\\\\nRespondent called in July, 1936, at the office of appellant\\\\u2019s sewer inspector and superintendent and requested permission to install a cesspool on his premises at Ninth avenue and Perry street. After inspection of respondent\\\\u2019s property, one of the officers of appellant\\\\u2019s sewer department informed the respondent that he would be required to connect with the Perry street sewer and that he would not be permitted to install a cesspool; that is, the city sewer superintendent and the city sewer inspector knew that respondent\\\\u2019s basement was too low to properly drain to the sewer, yet they required him to make the sewer connection, which they later inspected and approved.\\\\nThe basement drains and fixtures of respondent\\\\u2019s property were, pursuant to the foregoing instructions, connected in July, 1936, to the sewer in Perry street. Neither the superintendent of sewers nor the inspector, who required respondent to use iron pipe instead of clay pipe he contemplated installing, informed respondent that a back water trap was necessary or would be required; nor does the city ordinance require the installation of a back water trap. The sewer connection was installed by a man who had constructed sewers for more than twenty-five years. Doubtless, the installation of the connection was in the usual, customary, and workmanlike manner, as it was approved in all respects by appellant\\\\u2019s sewer inspector.\\\\nSince the construction of the Perry street sewer in 1908, the city\\\\u2019s population has greatly increased and many additional house connections \\\\u2014 eight hundred and ninety-one in 1933 \\\\u2014 have been made to the sewer. Many of the streets sloping toward Perry street have been paved within the past few years, so that the surface waters feed into the catch basins, and the remainder of the surface water that does not run into the catch basins accumulates at the comer of Ninth avenue and Perry street, in front of respondent\\\\u2019s property, where the street levels off and a pocket is formed at that intersection. Whenever it rains and the sewer becomes overloaded in that intersection, and often when it accumulates in the street, respondent\\\\u2019s basement receives some of the water.\\\\nDuring the heavy rains in the early part of June,\\' 1937, respondent complained to one of appellant\\\\u2019s commissioners concerning the flowing of water \\\\u2014 not in great quantities \\\\u2014 into his basement. The commissioner suggested to respondent that he install a \\\\u201cback water trap.\\\\u201d Respondent employed a plumber to install such a trap or check valve inside the basement. Whether the plumber did or did not advise respondent that the trap should be installed outside of the building, is not material. The plumber did advise respondent that a back water trap installed in the basement would protect the plumbing therein. There is some evidence that a back water trap installed outside the basement would not wholly prevent the backing up of sewage and water. It is clear, however, that respondent had no further serious difficulty subsequent to installation of a trap following the damage of which he now complains.\\\\nOn June 18, 1937, during a severe rain storm, respondent\\\\u2019s basement was flooded by reason of the backing up of the water and sewage from the Perry street sewer. Great damage was inflicted to property three miles from respondent\\\\u2019s property, it was testified, by the heavy rains. While there is evidence that the rainfall for the entire month of June was Very heavy, there is evidence from which it is reasonably inferable that the total rainfall for the month of June would not have overtaxed the sewer if it had functioned properly.\\\\nDuring the twenty-four hour period of June 18, 1937, forty-seven hundredths of an inch of rain fell. The weather bureau records disclosed that this rainfall was not unusual or excessive; that it had been exceeded many times during other twenty-four hour periods. On June 17, 1937, the day before the rainfall which it is claimed caused the flooding of respondent\\\\u2019s basement, five hundredths of an inch of rain fell. The testimony of one of the weather bureau officials was that, so far as the rainfall on June 18th and 19th, 1937, was concerned, \\\\u201cwe have had rainfall that was greater than that on numerous occasions in the city of Spokane.\\\\u201d On cross-examination, he testified that the rainfall on those two days was unusually heavy; \\\\u201c. . . it was unusual as compared to the normal.\\\\u201d\\\\nThat is, the rainfall was such as had occasionally occurred in the past and which the city should reasonably have expected to occur again. Under such circumstances, if the sewers are so inadequate that they can not take care of the water, the municipality is not relieved from responsibility because the rainfall was extraordinary.\\\\n\\\\u201cWhatever the rule may be as to ordinary surface water or rainfalls, it is settled that a municipal corporation is not liable for damages caused by an overflow of its sewers occasioned by extraordinary rains or floods. However, although the rain doing the damage be of an extraordinary character, yet if the negligence of the city in failing to keep the sewers open concurred and contributed to the damage, then the city has been held liable. And if drains are so inadequate that they cannot take care of the water in case of an ordinary storm, the municipality is not relieved from responsibility because the rainfall was extraordinary.\\\\u201d 6 McQuillin Mun. Corp., Revised (2d ed.), 1226, \\\\u00a7 2868.\\\\n\\\\u201cIn order to give a stream or body of water the character of an extraordinary flow it is not necessary that it should be the greatest flow within memory, but its character in this respect is to be tested by comparison with the usual volume of floods ordinarily occurring. The mere fact, however, that a rainfall was unusual for the particular season in which it occurs does not relieve the municipality from liability. A municipality, as a general rule, is required to guard against such floods or heavy rains as have occasionally occurred, and which may reasonably be expected to occur again, although their occurrence may be at irregular and wide intervals of time.\\\\u201d 43 C. J. 1137, \\\\u00a7 1895.\\\\nThe respondent was compelled by ordinance to connect his property to the sewer. The sewer connection was made in the manner approved by the appellant city. While the overflow of the sewer was caused by unusual rainfall, the rainfall was such as had occasionally occurred in the past and which the appellant should reasonably have expected to occur again. The appellant failed in its duty to guard against such heavy rainfall as that which overtaxed the Perry street sewer, which, though\\' adequate when constructed, had become of insufficient capacity in 1937 to carry off the water.\\\\nThe case at bar is controlled by Boyer v. Tacoma, 156 Wash. 280, 286 Pac. 659, 70 A. L. R. 1342, in which we held that a city is hable for the flooding of property required to be connected with a sewer which, though sufficient when constructed, had become of insufficient capacity to carry off the sewage conducted into it. We there said:\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is true that in other cases from this court statements have been made by way of argument which indicate that the contrary rule might be followed. See Vittucci Importing Co. v. Seattle, 72 Wash. 192, 130 Pac. 109. But the statements therein contained are not necessary to a decision of the case. The theory of all of the cases which we have examined, which hold the city liable under circumstances such as we have outlined above, seems to be that the property owner is required to connect with the sewer; that he is not permitted to dispose of his sewage in any other way than the one way provided by the city; that he has no power or authority to remove the cause, or to in any way remedy the defect from which his injury arises; that the city alone has the power and the means to remedy the defective sewer or to replace an inadequate sewer, and that no person should be required to suffer an injury caused by an agency over which he has no control and over which the city has absolute control, and that if an injury is inflicted by such an agency he should be properly compensated therefor. We think this is the better rule and is well supported by both reason and authority.\\\\u201d\\\\nWoolworth Co. v. Seattle, 104 Wash. 629, 177 Pac. 664, is cited by appellant in support of its theory that there can be no recovery for damages from flooding where the loss was due to the concurrent negligence of the city in the maintenance of sewers of insufficient capacity to carry off an average rainfall and the contributory negligence of the owner in failing to keep clean and in proper repair a back water valve required by ordinance in all cellar and basement drains.\\\\nIn the case cited, a city ordinance required the installation of back water valves; while, in the case at bar, there was an absence of such requirement. There is no ordinance, nor is there any regulation of any department, of appellant which required the respondent to install a back water trap to protect his basement. The sewer connection was approved by appellant in all respects. The back water trap was voluntarily installed by respondent inside of his building to protect the plumbing in the basement upon the suggestion of one of appellant\\\\u2019s commissioners when respondent complained of water coming into his basement. In spite of that precaution, he sustained damages; and even if he had installed a back water trap outside of his building, it is not improbable, under the circumstances, that he would have sustained damages.\\\\nError is next assigned on the allowance of the cost of fifty-five dollars for the installation of a back water trap. If appellant had required respondent to install, as it now insists he should have done, the back water trap at the time of the connection of his property to the sewer, that installation would have entailed very little expense. As appellant did not require that installation, which appellant insists would have prevented the dam\\\\u00e1ge, respondent should not be compelled to pay that which he would not have been required to expend if it had not been for appellant\\\\u2019s failure to perform its duty in the first place. Respondent acted in good faith and endeavored to comply with all the requirements exacted by appellant. The court correctly awarded to him the amount he expended in the installation of the back water trap.\\\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\\\nSteinert, C.

Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, Inc., et al, Appellants.\"],\"opinions\":[{\"text\":\"Utter, J. \\\\u2014\\\\nThe trial court in this case awarded damages to a homeowners association against a builder-vendor for construction defects in common and limited common areas of a condominium complex. The action was brought more than 3 years after the builder-vendor sold the last condominium unit, and many of the units changed hands before suit was filed. The applicable statutes of limitation properly should have barred many of the plaintiffs\\' actions. We hold that the trial court incorrectly applied the discovery rule for determining when plaintiffs\\' causes of action accrued.\\\\nThe trial court greatly extended the implied warranty of habitability beyond the contours defined by this court. The trial court also recognized a new cause of action to this jurisdiction in negligent construction. This court cannot allow sympathy for the plaintiffs to lead to the creation of a logically inconsistent and vague theory of recovery that fails to provide useful precedent. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.\\\\nYarrowood is a condominium complex located in Belle-vue. One hundred forty-four of the 155 units have private decks. Because of the steep topography and siting, there are 32 entry walkways which traverse from the parking area to provide access to unit entrances. Twenty-three of these serve only one apartment each. The bulk of the areas at issue were these private decks and walkways.\\\\nThe Declaration of Condominium (as amended) provides that private decks off individual apartments are \\\\\"limited common areas\\\\\", to which the individual apartment owner has exclusive access. The individual homeowners are solely responsible for their maintenance. Certain access walkways are also limited common areas, although the Declaration of Condominium does not specify precisely which walkways. The trial court found all these areas were \\\\\"common areas,\\\\u201d \\\\\"regardless of the subclassification of the private decks as \\'limited common areas\\'\\\\\" (Finding of fact 15; Clerk\\'s Papers, at 15) as that term is used in the Declaration of Condominium and by statute. See RCW 64.32.010(6)(b), (ll).\\\\nThe original developer, Ferguson Development Company and related corporate entities started work on the project in 1973. Ferguson intended to develop the complex in phases, and hired architect El Baylis to design the entire complex. After experimenting with various railing designs for the private decks and walkways, Ferguson adopted a wooden frame closed rail system. This involved the construction of a wall approximately 40 inches high, made of two-by-four studs enclosed on both sides with siding and gypsum board. The wall is capped by a wooden rail and joined at the bottom to the horizontal surface of the deck.\\\\nIn May 1975, when Phase I (67 apartments) was partially constructed, Ferguson defaulted and Coldwell Banker took over. From that point, Coldwell Banker was the owner, developer, construction contractor and vendor of the apartment units at Yarrowood.\\\\nWhen Coldwell Banker took over the project it hired architect Baylis to inspect and assess the project. Baylis informed Coldwell Banker that the decks and balconies were not adequately flashed at wall and\\\\/or rail junctures. In at least one instance a deck had no way to drain and would probably rot. In September 1975, Baylis notified Coldwell Banker that standing water on the flat asphalt roof of the largest building in the complex would lead to problems unless corrected. In response and as leakage became apparent and complaints were made, Coldwell Banker took corrective steps to repair or replace each of the Phase I decks that were called to its attention. Nonetheless, the trial court found the repairs and other construction changes made were ineffective to eliminate all of the problems.\\\\nColdwell Banker completed Phase I by mid-1976. The City of Bellevue Building Department issued a certificate of occupancy on June 10, 1976, although purchasers had occupied a number of units from late December 1975.\\\\nIn March 1976, Coldwell Banker contracted with architect Baylis to prepare construction drawings for Phase II, which added an additional 88 apartment units. Coldwell Banker instructed Baylis to make design changes in the walkway and deck assemblies in an attempt to avoid the problems experienced in Phase I. Phase II construction began in 1976, and on September 15, 1977, Bellevue issued a final certificate of occupancy. The last unit was sold in February 1978, some 4 years and 9 months before the commencement of the lawsuit in November 1982.\\\\nColdwell Banker turned over management of Yarrowood to the Board of Directors of the Yarrowood Homeowners Association (the Board) after substantially all of the units were sold. Following a short period in which Coldwell Banker acted as property manager, the Board hired a resident manager to handle complaints from homeowners, and to perform minor maintenance and repairs. The first manager served from early 1978 to 1980. During 1978 and 1979, he received complaints relating to 10 to 15 of the decks at Yarrowood. Some of the decks had damage which was plainly visible from public areas such as the parking lot for one of the buildings.\\\\nBy June 1979, at least one deck had so deteriorated that the homeowner asked the Board about having it rebuilt. In connection with this and other complaints being received, the Board contacted an attorney for advice on who was responsible for repairing the deteriorating decks. The Board described the problem to the attorney as a design defect. After reviewing the Declaration of Condominium, the attorney responded that in his view the responsibility for repair and maintenance of these limited common areas lay with the individual homeowners, rather than with the Board.\\\\nThe Board relayed the attorney\\'s advice to the homeowners, and took the position that these defects were not the Board\\'s responsibility. Some of the Board members had initial leakage problems which Coldwell Banker had worked on. In fact, the majority of the nine members of the Board in the years 1979 and 1980 knew during or before their service on the Board of leakage problems on Yarrowood decks.\\\\nIn November 1980, the Board contacted a second attorney for his opinion on repair responsibilities. This attorney advised if the problem was a construction defect then the Board, rather than the individual homeowners, should pursue claims against the developer on behalf of the common ownership. Upon receiving this advice, the Board specifically asked the homeowners to lodge their complaints with the Board\\'s resident manager. A number of such complaints were formally registered before the next meeting, which took place on December 18, 1980.\\\\nIn November 1982, the members of the Board filed suit in their representative capacities on behalf of both original and subsequent purchasers of affected units against Cold-well Banker, El Baylis, and Ferguson. The suit alleged defendants were liable under theories of negligent construction, breach of express and implied warranties, misrepresentation, and violations of the Consumer Protection Act, RCW 19.86.\\\\nAs of that time, 74 out of the 155 units had changed hands from the original purchasers to subsequent purchasers. By May 1984, the month of trial, the number of units owned by subsequent purchasers had risen to 81, constituting a majority of the units in the complex.\\\\nThe trial court found plaintiffs\\' suit was timely brought within the applicable statute of limitations, reasoning that the claims accrued at the December 18, 1980 meeting, when the Board had notice that the deck and walkway problems were widespread throughout the project. The court found that\\\\nAlthough plaintiffs received some isolated complaints from unit owners of water leaks and stains with respect to the private decks attached to the unit, there was not a sufficient number of complaints or sufficient quality of the complaints received to indicate a project-wide problem with substantially all decks and the degree to which the decks were affected until December 1980.\\\\nFinding of fact 30; Clerk\\'s Papers, at 20-21.\\\\nThe court held there was no liability under the Washington Consumer Protection Act, nor under plaintiffs\\' theory of breach of express warranty or misrepresentation. Plaintiffs have not appealed those rulings.\\\\nThe court noted that the applicable provisions of the uniform building code and industry standards required that the decks, balconies, walkways, ramps, and stairway structures be constructed in a watertight manner. It found, however, that the areas were not so constructed, and allowed water to penetrate from the time of original construction. These defects, both latent and patent, the court held, led to rotting and the substantial impairment of the structures.\\\\nThe court found that rotting conditions between initial occupancy and 1980 were known by the homeowners, who complained to Coldwell Banker, which responded to all complaints by making repairs and replacements. It found, however, that the complaints were not in every case communicated to the Board.\\\\nA determination was made by the court that the defective conditions were caused by negligent construction practices which left\\\\nthe largest majority of the affected structures in Yarro-wood unfit for their ordinary and intended purpose and dangerous to use within a very short time after their construction. . . .\\\\nAlthough structurally safe for the buyer\\'s intended purpose at the time of construction and initial purchase by individual owners, a number of the private decks, balconies and walkways became unsafe through the action of dry rot from water trapped as a result of construction defects.\\\\nFindings of fact 19, 20; Clerk\\'s Papers, at 18. It held that both the original and subsequent purchasers could recover for the. entire damages to common areas and limited common areas under a negligence theory, and that the original owners could also recover under implied warranties of habitability.\\\\nColdwell Banker, as owner-developer-builder-vendor of the complex, which was constructed for sale to the general public, was determined to owe a duty of proper construction, a duty which includes the nonnegligent construction of elements within the common and limited common areas. The court further held that no privity of contract need exist in order for Coldwell Banker to be liable for damages caused by negligent performance of its contractual duty.\\\\nColdwell Banker was also held to have impliedly warranted to the original purchasers that the common and limited common areas were fit for their ordinary and intended purpose, that the applicable building code provisions were complied with and that the construction was performed in a proper and workmanlike manner with respect to building methods, techniques, or materials used. The court concluded that Coldwell Banker breached the implied warranty of habitability (thus defined), and was liable to plaintiffs for damages sustained as a proximate result of this breach.\\\\nOf the $378,758 in damages awarded by the trial court, $87,680 represented repair costs to private decks which were limited common areas exclusive to units owned by subsequent purchasers. No separate finding was made with respect to walkways for which damages were awarded, but which serve secondary purchasers\\' units.\\\\nThree issues are raised on appeal: (1) whether the trial court correctly determined the time the plaintiffs\\' causes of action accrued for purposes of the discovery rule; (2) whether the court properly applied the implied warranty of habitability theory as developed by our courts; and (3) whether the trial court erred in recognizing a new cause of action in negligent construction.\\\\nStatute of Limitations\\\\nColdwell Banker acknowledges the Board\\'s standing to sue on behalf of two or more individual condominium owners with similar claims pursuant to RCW 64.32.240. That statute provides, in part:\\\\nWithout limiting the rights of any apartment owner, actions may be brought as provided by law and by the rules of court by the manager or board of directors, in either case in the discretion of the board of directors, on behalf of two or more of the apartment owners, as their respective interests may appear, with respect to any cause of action relating to the common areas and facilities or more than one apartment. . . .\\\\n(Italics ours.) The Board has standing to sue on behalf of and as a surrogate for the individual homeowners. Coldwell Banker argues with merit that this statutory grant of standing does not accord the Board or the Association the status of a separate juristic entity. The Association is not incorporated. It has no life independent of the individual homeowners who are by statute and under the terms of the Declaration of Condominium required to be members of the Association. The rights being asserted, and the claims being made, belong to the individual homeowners. As found by the trial court, the lawsuit was brought in the names of the nine then members of the Board of Directors of the Association in their representative capacities, not in the name of the Board or Association as a separate entity.\\\\nThe trial court, however, determined that the claims asserted here accrued at the time the Board had notice that the deck and walkway problems were widespread throughout the project. Neither RCW 64.32.240 nor the discovery rule support such a conclusion. RCW 64.32-.240 authorizes the Board to bring suit on behalf of two or more apartment owners. There is no requirement that the majority or even that a substantial number of apartments be affected. The trial court\\'s conclusion that, despite the plain meaning of the statute, the Board was required to wait to bring suit until \\\\\"a sufficient number\\\\\" of apartment owners were affected is unjustified.\\\\nA statute which is plain needs no construction. King Cy. v. Seattle, 70 Wn.2d 988, 425 P.2d 887 (1967). It is neither the function nor the prerogative of courts to modify legislative enactments. Anderson v. Seattle, 78 Wn.2d 201, 471 P.2d 87 (1970). The trial court\\'s formulation of a requirement of a \\\\\"sufficient number\\\\\" of affected units is not supported by the statute and is unworkably vague. The Board\\'s strategic decision to bring suit at the time that it did will not be aided by this court with a reading not sustained by the language or the spirit of RCW 64.32.240.\\\\nThe trial court\\'s application of the discovery rule is inconsistent with the analysis applied by this court in White v. Johns-Manville Corp., 103 Wn.2d 344, 348, 693 P.2d 687 (1985): \\\\\"[A] cause of action accrues at the time the plaintiff knew or should have known all of the essential elements of the cause of action.\\\\\" Awareness of the essential elements of a cause of action and awareness that one has a cause of action are not necessarily the same, for purposes of a statute of limitation. Sahlie v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 99 Wn.2d 550, 554, 663 P.2d 473 (1983). This court made that distinction in Sahlie to underscore our position that a cause of action accrues when a plaintiff discovers, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered, the elements of the cause of action, and not when the plaintiff realized that they had a legally cognizable injury.\\\\nThe applicable statute of limitations in this lawsuit is 3 years from the date of discovery under RCW 4.16.080(2). That statute should operate, however, as of the time the homeowners actually knew or reasonably should have known of the defects that comprised the elements of their causes of action. The trial court acknowledged that many of the individual homeowners knew and complained of defects as early as 1976. The trial court found that between 1976 and 1980 the owners of 13 units were aware of damage that required repair. The Board was sufficiently concerned by June 1979 to consult a lawyer as to who had the responsibility to repair the deteriorating decks. In the face of this abundant evidence of actual notice to the Board and to the individual apartment owners, the trial court\\'s conclusion that the cause of action did not accrue until December 1980 is unsupported by the record.\\\\nImplied Warranty op Habitability\\\\nThe implied warranty of habitability in Washington is a limited one:\\\\n[W]hen a vendor-builder sells a new house to its first intended occupant, he impliedly warrants that the foundations supporting it are firm and secure and that the house is structurally safe for the buyer\\'s intended purpose of living in it.\\\\nHouse v. Thornton, 76 Wn.2d 428, 436, 457 P.2d 199 (1969). House and progeny have been applied in this state to grant recovery to the first intended occupants for egregious, fundamental defects in homes which, as the name of the warranty indicates, render the houses unfit to be lived in. The plaintiffs in House contended with a house with a foundation so faulty that the basement, walls, floors and foundation slipped and cracked, and the supporting terrain slid away from the foundation.\\\\nThis court has not been anxious to extend the implied warranty of habitability beyond its present boundaries. Frickel v. Sunnyside Enters., 106 Wn.2d 714, 725 P.2d 422 (1986) (court declined to extend implied warranty of habitability to sale of apartment complex despite serious foundation defects and improper construction, where property was not built for resale and sales contract contained express disclaimers of such warranty).\\\\nOther cases in Washington brought under the implied warranty of habitability premise recovery upon proof of defects which profoundly compromise the essential nature of the subject property as a dwelling. Klos v. Gockel, 87 Wn.2d 567, 554 P.2d 1349 (1976) (recovery denied where patio and backyard were damaged by a mud slide and the settling of fill, but house itself suffered only minimal damage); Allen v. Anderson, 16 Wn. App. 446, 557 P.2d 24 (1976) (alleged foundation faults, cracks and bows in retaining walls, dismissed on other grounds); Gay v. Cornwall, 6 Wn. App. 595, 494 P.2d 1371 (1972) (leaks in roof, plumbing defective, sewer pipe dumped raw sewage into crawl space, furnace motor burned out, drain field washed away).\\\\nThe doctrine of implied warranty of habitability imposes liability upon builder-vendors in favor of original purchasers of residential property for egregious defects in the fundamental structure of a home. The warranty does not provide recovery for defects in exterior, nonstructural elements adjacent to the dwelling unit. The instant case involves defects similar to those in Klos v. Gockel, supra. In Klos, a landslide caused damage to the plaintiff\\'s patio, but not to the house itself. The trial court ruled that the slide, while not injuring the foundation, rendered the residence unfit for occupancy, \\\\\"if not in terms of actual danger, then at least in terms of threatening one\\'s peace of mind\\\\\". Klos, at 569. This court overruled that holding, noting that the plaintiffs never moved out of the house and were still occupying it at time of trial. Klos does not support an extension of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability for mere defects in workmanship. The Klos court denied recovery to the plaintiffs, holding that:\\\\nThe law of implied warranty is not broad enough to make the builder-vendor of a house absolutely liable for all mishaps occurring within the boundaries of the improved real property.\\\\nKlos, at 571-72.\\\\nIn the case at bar, some of the damaged areas were decks, similar in use to the patio area in Klos. Others were walkways that may have comprised the sole means of access to the apartments, although the record fails to make this clear. Finding of fact 15; Clerk\\'s Papers, at 15. As to the access walkways, one could plausibly argue that the defects occurred in an essential portion of the dwelling itself. Unfortunately, the record does not distinguish among the units, and there was no allegation that any apartment owner was prevented from using his or her unit because of the defects. Plaintiff homeowners who were not barred by the statute of limitations could plausibly maintain an action for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, where they were unable to enter their dwelling units safely. Such a defect could be said to render a home unit unfit for its intended purpose. Unfortunately, the record before this court is insufficient for purposes of making such a determination.\\\\nNegligent Construction\\\\nCurrently, the State of Washington does not recognize a cause of action for negligent construction on behalf of individual homeowners. Beyond the terms expressed in the contract of sale, the only recognized duty owing from a builder-vendor of a newly completed residence to its first purchaser is that embodied in the implied warranty of habitability, which arises from the sale transaction. House v. Thornton, supra at 436. Plaintiff homeowners faced with losses that are not of their own making present a sympathetic case, and we understand the desire of the trial court to fashion a remedy. We must exercise caution, however, that we do not unduly upset the law upon which expectations are built and business is conducted.\\\\nThe theory advanced by the trial court is a peculiar combination of tort and contract law, closely related to the tort law of products liability. Comment, Manufacturer\\'s Liability to Remote Purchasers for \\\\\"Economic Loss\\\\\" Damages\\\\u2014 Tort or Contract?, 114 U. Pa. L. Rev. 539 (1966). Dean Prosser characterized the law of products liability as a \\\\\"hybrid, born of the illicit intercourse of tort and contract, unique in the law.\\\\\" W. Prosser, Torts 634 (4th ed. 1971).\\\\nInitially, plaintiffs who suffered personal injuries from defective products could only reach the manufacturer under warranty theories. Courts, however, had difficulty meshing the inapposite \\\\\"intricacies of the law of sales,\\\\\" Prosser, The Assault Upon the Citadel, 69 Yale L.J. 1099 (1960), such as notice and privity, with the plight presented by injured consumers who did not have a direct contractual relationship with the manufacturer. Accordingly, the doctrine fell prey to logical difficulties inherent in this procrustean approach, which addressed problems of unsafe conduct with a legal theory premised on receiving the benefit of a bargain. Pennsylvania Glass Sand Corp. v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 652 F.2d 1165, 1168-69 (3d Cir. 1981).\\\\nThe first cases holding manufacturers liable for injuries caused by their products in the absence of privity of contract used a negligence theory. The landmark decision in this area was MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (1916) (Cardozo, J.). MacPherson has been accepted in every jurisdiction in the United States to provide a remedy to plaintiffs injured by manufactured items that are dangerous if negligently made. W. Prosser, Torts \\\\u00a7 96, at 642-43 (4th ed. 1971). Courts reasoned that privity of contract should not stand as a bar to plaintiff consumers who suffered physical injury from a product negligently made.\\\\nAs a matter of public policy, it is entirely reasonable to expect manufacturers of goods for sale to the general public to assume responsibility for the safety of their product. In Seely v. White Motor Co., 63 Cal. 2d 9, 403 P.2d 145, 45 Cal. Rptr. 17 (1965), Justice Traynor denied recovery to a plaintiff who had pleaded lost profits as the only damages under a negligence theory. Justice Traynor stated at page 18:\\\\nThe distinction that the law has drawn between tort recovery for physical injuries and warranty recovery for economic loss is not arbitrary and does not rest on the \\\\\"luck\\\\\" of one plaintiff in having an accident causing physical injury. The distinction rests, rather, on an understanding of the nature of the responsibility a manufacturer must undertake in distributing his products. He can appropriately be held liable for physical injuries caused by defects by requiring his goods to match a standard of safety defined in terms of conditions that create unreasonable risks of harm. He cannot be held for the level of performance of his products in the consumer\\'s business unless he agrees that the product was designed to meet the consumer\\'s demands. A consumer should not be charged at the will of the manufacturer with bearing the risk of physical injury when he buys a product on the market. He can, however, be fairly charged with the risk that the product will not match his economic expectations unless the manufacturer agrees that it will. . . .\\\\nThis court has acknowledged the extreme confusion in the development of our own case law, and we have, in the past, allowed recovery under a negligence theory for lost profits standing alone (upon proof of causation and breach of duty). Berg v. General Motors Corp., 87 Wn.2d 584, 591, 555 P.2d 818 (1976). In Berg, this court noted the convoluted history of products liability doctrine, conceded that \\\\\"[cjourts are anxious to find some legal theory sufficient to protect the public interest\\\\\", Berg, at 593, and made a policy-based decision to allow damages to a commercial fisherman for the anticipated value of a fish catch that was lost when his boat was laid up for repairs of defendant manufacturer\\'s negligently built motor.\\\\nThe instant case, however, presents a leap beyond the theory applied in Berg. The plaintiffs have alleged no injury beyond the affected areas themselves, and no damages beyond the cost of repair. In its effort to find recovery for the plaintiffs, the trial court formulated a theory of recovery in negligence that overlooks the intricacies and logical inconsistencies inherent in the approach.\\\\nCommentators and courts faced with this issue have found it necessary to distinguish economic loss from physical harm or property damage. The distinction is usually drawn depending on the nature of the defect and the manner in which the damage occurred. Defects of quality are evidenced by internal deterioration, and designated as economic loss, while loss stemming from defects that cause accidents involving violence or collision with external objects is treated as physical injury. Pennsylvania Glass Sand, at 1169-70. See Note, Economic Loss in Products Liability Jurisprudence, 66 Colum. L. Rev. 917, 918 (1966); see also Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 626 F.2d 280 (3d Cir. 1980).\\\\nTort law has traditionally redressed injuries properly classified as physical harm. W. Prosser, Torts \\\\u00a7 101, at 665 (4th ed. 1971). Tort law is concerned with the obligations imposed by law, rather than by bargain. As a matter of public policy, it is appropriate that a duty be imposed on manufacturers to produce products that will not unreasonably endanger the safety and health of the public, whether the ultimate impact of the danger is suffered by people, other property, or on the product itself. In contrast, contract law protects expectation interests, and provides an appropriate set of rules when an individual bargains for a product of particular quality or for a particular use.\\\\nIn cases such as the present one where only the defective product is damaged, the court should identify whether the particular injury amounts to economic loss or physical damage. In drawing the distinction, the determinative factor should not be the items for which damages are sought, such as repair costs. Rather, the line between tort and contract must be drawn by analyzing interrelated factors such as the nature of the defect, the type of risk, and the manner in which the injury arose. These factors bear directly on whether the safety-insurance policy of tort law or the expectation-bargain protection policy of warranty law is most applicable to the claim in question. Pennsylvania Glass Sand, at 1173.\\\\nThe nature of the defect here was that the decks and walkways were not of the quality desired by the buyers. The \\\\\"injury\\\\\" or damage suffered was that the decks themselves deteriorated, not through accident or violent occurrence, but through exposure to the weather.\\\\nThe plaintiffs advanced theories of recovery under the Consumer Protection Act, RCW 19.86, under a theory of misrepresentation, and under the express warranties contained in the contract of sale with the builder-vendor. The trial court correctly held that recovery was not available under any of these theories, and plaintiffs have not appealed those rulings. This is unremarkable, in that the express terms of the contract with the builder-vendor delegated the risks among the parties, and formed part of the basis of their bargain.\\\\nIn its search to provide relief where the contract did not, the trial court stretched the implied warranty of habitability beyond recognition to grant recovery to original purchasers of condominium units. The trial court then accepted the plaintiffs\\' invitation to recognize a poorly reasoned cause of action to grant recovery to subsequent purchasers. The dangers in creating such unreasoned precedent are manifest.\\\\nImposition of tort liability upon the builder-vendors would require them to become the guarantors of the complete satisfaction of future purchasers. A builder-vendor could contract to limit liability for defects with the original purchaser and then find themselves liable for the same defects to a future purchaser with whom they had absolutely no contact. The trial court\\'s formulation makes no distinction between subsequent purchasers who may have known nothing of the potential deterioration of the decks, and those buyers who may have been able to see the flaking observable to the naked eye from the exhibits before the court. The latter buyers may well have been able to account for the defects with an adjustment to the purchase price. As to such buyers, any recovery from the court would be a pure windfall.\\\\nThere is nothing in the trial court\\'s disposition of the case to limit liability for the same defects in the same units to future subsequent purchasers. In a commodity such as condominiums, it is not unthinkable that speculators could sell and resell the property rapidly enough to escape the strictures of the statute of limitations. This court will not sanction such result-oriented jurisprudence, particularly in an area of the law so vitally enmeshed in our economy and dependent on settled expectations as is the construction business. We decline to recognize a cause of action in negligent construction.\\\\nWe reverse and remand to the trial court to determine, consistent with this opinion, (1) which, if any, of the plaintiffs were not barred by the statute of limitations, and (2) which units owned by such plaintiffs had walkways so impaired that the sole means of access to the unit was dangerous to negotiate.\\\\nPearson, C.J., and Brachtenbach, Dolliver, Andersen, Goodloe, and Durham, JJ., concur.\\\\nRCW 64.32.010(6) (b) provides, in pertinent part:\\\\n\\\\\"(6) \\'Common areas and facilities\\', unless otherwise provided in the declaration as duly recorded or as it may be lawfully amended, includes: . . .\\\\n\\\\\"(b) The foundation, columns, girders, beams, supports, main walls, roofs, halls, corridors, lobbys [sic], stairs, stairways, fire escapes, and entrances and exits of the building;\\\\\"\\\\nRCW 64.32.010(11) provides, in pertinent part:\\\\n\\\\\" (11) \\'Limited common areas and facilities\\' includes those common areas and facilities designated in the declaration, as it is duly recorded or as it may be lawfully amended, as reserved for use of certain apartment or apartments to the exclusion of the other apartments.\\\\\"\\\\nColdwelI Banker cross-claimed against Baylis for recovery in the event of a finding of liability for negligent design. Both plaintiffs and Coldwell Banker dropped their claims against Baylis prior to trial. Ferguson apparently went through bankruptcy proceedings some time prior to trial.\",\"type\":\"majority\",\"author\":\"Utter, J. \\\\u2014\"},{\"text\":\"Callow, J.\\\\n(concurring in part, dissenting in part) \\\\u2014 I concur with the majority\\'s discussion of the statute of limitations and the implied warranty of habitability. I dissent, however, from the majority\\'s refusal to recognize a cause of action in negligent construction in a case such as this, where a builder has sold condominiums with latent dangerous defects. The majority reasons that no claim of negligent construction can lie because the purchasers have suffered only \\\\\"economic loss\\\\\". I submit this is unsound and unpersuasive. Purchasers of condominiums who have been the victims of shoddy and unsafe construction practices, yet who have no remedy under the implied warranty of habitability, should not be denied recovery merely because they have been fortunate to escape serious physical injury.\\\\nThe record before us shows that Coldwell Banker built and sold several condominiums with latent dangerous defects, and that such defects were the result of negligent construction. The trial court specifically found:\\\\nIn constructing the deck and railing systems in the complex, Coldwell Banker was negligent in needlessly splicing the rail cap, in failing to provide adequate drainage at the bottom of the enclosed rails and decks, in inadequately flashing the juncture of the deck and the rail wall, in using interior gypsum wallboard inside of the rail structures, rather than exterior gypsum sheathing, especially when accompanied by a failure to protect that interior wallboard by placing adequate building paper over the wallboard and\\\\/or over the top of the inside rail structure to prevent rain or other water coming into the structure through the rail cap.\\\\nAll of the defects, individually or in combination, greatly hastened the rotting of these structures.\\\\nThus, the court concluded:\\\\nAlthough structurally safe for the buyer\\'s intended purpose at the time of construction and initial purchase by individual owners, a number of the [condominiums\\'] private decks, balconies and [access] walkways became unsafe through the action of dry rot trapped as a result of construction defects.\\\\nThe trial court also noted:\\\\nSome of the defects which ultimately led to rotting . . . were not visible, such as lack of ventilation, inadequate flashing or failure to wrap gypsum board with building paper.\\\\nAs the majority points out, some of the affected purchasers may seek recovery for breach of the implied warranty of habitability. This provides but limited relief. The implied warranty of habitability protects only the first intended occupants of new condominiums, and covers only structural defects which render the condominium uninhabitable. Frickel v. Sunnyside Enters., 106 Wn.2d 714, 715-18, 725 P.2d 422 (1986); Klos v. Gockel, 87 Wn.2d 567, 571-72, 554 P.2d 1349 (1976); House v. Thornton, 76 Wn.2d 428, 436, 457 P.2d 199 (1969). It does not provide a remedy for subsequent purchaser\\\\/occupants; nor for original purchaser\\\\/ occupants of condominiums with dangerously defective decks or balconies (as opposed to access walkways), since these structures do not render the dwelling itself \\\\\"uninhabitable.\\\\\" I find no reason to cut off a subsequent purchaser from a remedy in such a situation just because the property has changed hands twice rather than only once.\\\\nThe purchaser of a condominium has the right to expect that it will be properly constructed and free of latent and dangerous defects of any kind. As explained in Oates v. JAG, Inc., 314 N.C. 276, 333 S.E.2d 222 (1985):\\\\nWe must be realistic. The ordinary purchaser of a home is not qualified to determine when or where a defect exists. Yet, the purchaser makes the biggest and most important investment in his or her life and, more times than not, on a limited budget. The purchaser can ill afford to suddenly find a latent defect in his or her home . . . and have no remedy for recourse. This happens too often. The careless work of contractors, who in the past have been insulated from liability, must cease or they must accept financial responsibility for their negligence. In our judgment, building contractors should be held to the general standard of reasonable care for the protection of anyone who may foreseeably be endangered by their negligence.\\\\nOates, at 280-81 (quoting Simmons v. Owens, 363 So. 2d 142, 143 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1978).\\\\nI would join the growing number of jurisdictions that recognize a cause of action for negligent construction. See, e.g., Oates; Council of Co-Owners Atlantis Condominium, Inc. v. Whiting-Turner Contracting Co., 308 Md. 18, 517 A.2d 336 (1986); Cosmopolitan Homes, Inc. v. Weller, 663 P.2d 1041 (Colo. 1983); Kristek v. Catron, 7 Kan. App. 2d 495, 644 P.2d 480 (1982); Velotta v. Leo Petronzio Landscaping, Inc., 69 Ohio St. 2d 376, 433 N.E.2d 147 (1982); Juliano v. Gaston, 187 N.J. Super. 491, 455 A.2d 523 (1982); Drexel Properties, Inc. v. Bay Colony Club Condominium, Inc., 406 So. 2d 515 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1981); Terlinde v. Neely, 275 S.C. 395, 271 S.E.2d 768, 10 A.L.R.4th 379 (1980); Moxley v. Laramie Builders, Inc., 600 P.2d 733 (Wyo. 1979); Brown v. Fowler, 279 N.W.2d 907 (S.D. 1979); Sabella v. Wisler, 59 Cal. 2d 21, 377 P.2d 889, 27 Cal. Rptr. 689 (1963); Fisher v. Simon, 15 Wis. 2d 207, 112 N.W.2d 705 (1961). I would hold that a purchaser may bring a claim for negligent construction against the builder-vendor of a home if the home has a latent and dangerous defect which creates a risk of personal injury. Hopefully, of course, the dangerous condition will be detected before personal injury actually occurs. In such a case, the purchaser\\'s recovery would consist of the reasonable cost of correcting the dangerous condition.\\\\nThe majority rejects this alternative, reasoning that absent physical injury or property damage, the purchaser has suffered only \\\\\"economic loss\\\\\" and thus is barred from recovery in tort. This view of negligence law has been rejected by numerous other courts. Most recently, the Maryland Supreme Court approved precisely the cause of action in negligent construction outlined above. The court added that where a latent and dangerously defective condition exists, economic loss alone is not a bar to recovery. The court said:\\\\nThe contention that a distinction should be drawn between mere \\\\\"economic loss\\\\\" and personal injury is without merit. . . .\\\\nIf there is a defect in a stairway and the purchaser repairs the defect and suffers an economic loss, should he fail to recover because he did not wait until he or some member of his family fell down the stairs and broke his neck? Does the law penalize those who are alert and prevent injury? Should it not put those who prevent personal injury on the same level as those who fail to anticipate it?\\\\nCouncil of Co-Owners Atlantis Condominium, at 34-35, quoting Barnes v. Mac Brown & Co., 264 Ind. 227, 230, 342 N.E.2d 619 (1976). The additional cases cited likewise reject any distinction between personal injury and economic loss in the context of a negligent construction claim.\\\\nRecognizing a cause of action in negligent construction affords purchasers of homes or condominiums a remedy for dangerous and shoddy construction without imposing an undue burden on builder-vendors. Since this cause of action sounds in tort, the remedy extends to both original and subsequent purchasers (i.e., privity of contract with the builder-vendor is not required). However, the builder-vendor\\'s potential liability is not unlimited, for the statute of limitations expressly bars commencement of any suit that does not accrue within 6 years of substantial completion of construction. See RCW 4.16.310. Moreover, a purchaser who brings a claim for negligent construction, but who suffers economic loss alone, must prove (1) negligence on the part of the builder-vendor caused a defective condition, (2) the defective condition is dangerous, (3) the defective condition was latent at the time of purchase. As explained in Cosmopolitan Homes, at 1045-46:\\\\nThe reason for allowing recovery only for latent or hidden defects, which have been defined as \\\\\"those manifesting themselves after purchase and which are not discoverable through reasonable inspection,\\\\\" ... is to prevent an action where mere deterioration or loss of a bargain is claimed. . . . Often a buyer is willing to accept certain deficiencies in a house in exchange for a lower purchase price. However, a buyer cannot be expected to discover structural defects which remain latent at the time of purchase.\\\\nIf a purchaser meets these requirements, there is no reason why he should not recover from the builder-vendor for negligent construction. The alternative offered by the majority is to subject the purchaser to the outworn and antiquated doctrine of caveat emptor. This court should find such an alternative unacceptable.\\\\nI would remand to the trial court to determine first, which plaintiffs are barred from recovery by the statute of limitations; second, which plaintiffs have stated a valid claim for breach of the implied warranty of habitability; and third, which plaintiffs have stated a valid claim for negligent construction as outlined above. I respectfully dissent to the extent that my proposed resolution of this case differs from that of the majority.\\\\nDore, J., concurs with Callow, J.\",\"type\":\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\",\"author\":\"Callow, J.\"}],\"attorneys\":[\"Davis, Wright, Todd, Riese & Jones, by Duncan A.

Later they entered into a written lease of the premises for the.term of one year from the 15th day of October, 1922, for a total rental of $3,000, all paid in advance, with an option to renew for an additional year at $275 per month, to be paid monthly in advance. The provisions of the lease with reference to repairs, read:\\\\n\\\\u201cAnd It Is Hereby Agreed, that the parties of the second part are to maintain and keep said building in good repair and return same at the expiration of this lease to the party of the first part, its heirs, administrators or assigns in as good condition as at the present time, excepting that first party will make repairs to the exterior of premises occasioned by reasonable use and wear thereof.\\\\u201d \\\\u2022\\\\nAttached to the lease as a rider, or indorsed thereon, was the following provision, signed by both parties:\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is further agreed in the foregoing lease that in the event that said premises shall be destroyed by fire or that second parties are unable to occupy the said premises on account of fire, that the unearned portion of the money deposited for the first year\\\\u2019s rent shall be refunded to the second party by the first party, and that the second party shall have a lien upon any insurance money payable on account of such fire or destruction on account of fire for the payment of said sum, and in the event that any portion of said premises cannot be occupied, or that the said second party shall be dispossessed of said premises before the expiration of the first year\\\\u2019s lease by the act of the first party or by process of law, without the fault or neglect of the second party, that then the unearned portion of said payment shall be refunded to the second party.\\\\u201d\\\\nEarly on the morning of January 2, 1923, the boiler of the heating plant in the leased building was found to be leaking badly, and on examination it was found that tbe bottom of tbe boiler bad rusted out, so that it was beyond repair, and that a new boiler was absolutely necessary. Tbe building was then occupied by guests and tenants who required beat for tbeir comfort and well-being, and something bad to be done immediately. . Appellant Bonza wired tbe landlord, respondent, who was a non-resident, advising him somewhat as to tbe situation, and without awaiting any reply to bis telegram ordered a new boiler installed by tbe plaintiff at an expense of $939.25. Not having been paid therefor, tbe plaintiff brought this action against both tbe owner and tbe tenant for tbe price of tbe installation of tbe new boiler. Tbe tenants Bonza cross-complained against tbe landlord, Hardung,- asking in effect that, if they were held liable to tbe plaintiff, they might have judgment over against Hardung. Tbe case was tried to tbe court sitting without a jury, resulting in a judgment in favor of tbe plaintiff and against tbe appellants Bonza only, for tbe full amount claimed, and denying appellants any recovery from Hardung on tbeir cross-complaint. From that part of tbe judgment denying appellants a judgment over against Hardung, tbe defendants and cross-complainants, Bonza and wife, have appealed.\\\\nAppellants urge, and tbe evidence tends to show, that this was not an ordinary repair, since it was testified that with proper care tbe new boiler would last practically a lifetime, and authorities are cited which distinguish between repairs and renewals or replacements. But, as we read tbe covenant, it is not simply a covenant to make ordinary repairs. Tbe words: \\\\u201cto maintain and keep said building in good repair and return same at tbe expiration of this lease to tbe party of the first part, . . . in as good condition as at tbe present time, excepting that first party will make repairs to the exterior of premises occasioned by reasonable nse and wear thereof,\\\\u201d when construed as a whole, and effect given to every part, seem beyond cavil to bear only the meaning which the trial court evidently ascribed to them.\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is the well settled common law rule that a tenant\\\\u2019s general covenant to repair the demised premises binds him under all circumstances, even though the injury proceeds from an act of God, from the elements, or from the act of a stranger, and if he desires to relieve himself from liability for injuries resulting from any of the causes above enumerated, or from any other cause whatever, he must take care to except them from the operation of his covenant. Under this rule, if the tenant enters into an express and unconditional covenant to repair and keep in repair, or to surrender the premises in good repair, he is liable for the destruction of buildings not rebuilt by him, though the destruction may have occurred by fire or other accident, or by the act of enemies, without fault on his part.\\\\u201d 16 E. C. L. p. 1088, \\\\u00a7 605.\\\\nIn our own case of Robinson v. Wilson, 102 Wash. 528, it was said:\\\\n\\\\u201cWe think it will not be questioned that a landlord is not a guarantor of the fitness of a building for the purpose for which it is leased unless he binds himself by written contract. Nor will the fact that he knows the use to which it is to be put hold him to such liability where, as in this case, no restrictions are put upon the use of the building in the written lease.\\\\n\\\\u201c \\\\u2018It is agreed by the authorities at the present time that, as a general rule, there is no obligation on the part of the lessor to see that the premises are, at the time of the demise, in a condition of fitness for use for the purpose for which the lessee may propose to use them. A lessee, like the purchaser of a thing already in existence, is presumed to take only after examination. The maxim caveat emptor applies, and if he desires to protect himself in this regard he must exact of the lessor an express stipulation as to the condition of the premises.\\\\u2019 Tiffany, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a786.\\\\n\\\\u201c \\\\u2018As the landlord is under no obligation to the lessee, as regards the condition of the premises, or its fitness for the lessee\\\\u2019s purpose, at the time of the demise, so he is under no obligation to the lessee, or to the latter\\\\u2019s assignee, to keep the premises during the tenancy in a condition satisfactory to the latter. Accordingly, a landlord is not bound, as a general rule, in the absence of special stipulation, to make repairs or improvements on the premises in order to render them safe or fit them for the tenant\\\\u2019s use. And as a result of this principle, the tenant cannot assert any claim against the landlord on account of injury to himself or his property owing to defects in the premises arising since the demise. . . . Even though the\\\\npremises are leased for a particular purpose, and any other use thereof is prohibited, the landlord is, it has been decided, under no obligation to keep them fit for such use.\\\\u2019 Id., \\\\u00a787.\\\\n\\\\u201cSee, also, Taylor, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a7327, et seq.; 24 Cyc. 1081.\\\\n\\\\u201cThe trouble in this case is that we are asked to make a contract grounded in the equities incident to subsequent events, where the parties, who might have foreseen every incident and circumstances now relied on, failed to guard against them in their written contract. And this is where the trial judge fell into error. He says:\\\\n\\\\u201c \\\\u2018I think, however, that it cannot be successfully disputed that in the extreme wet months of the year there are defects in the building and heating plant, Which are not within the contemplation of the lease, and which resulted in a loss to the defendants.\\\\u2019\\\\n\\\\u201cIt may at times result in inequity, but the law is so written that a landlord is not bound beyond the terms of his lease, and that parties who enter written contracts are presumed to have in contemplation probable consequence and the established principles of law.\\\\n\\\\u201cWritten contracts would be of little consequence to the business world if they were to be so overcome, or, if working to the disadvantage of one who has agreed to pay a certain price, his express contract could he turned, over the protest of his adversary, into a quantum valebat.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe reasoning in Johnston v. Nichols, 83 Wash. 394, 145 Pac. 417; Clarke v. Yukon Investment Co., 83 Wash. 485, 145 Pac. 624, Ann. Cas. 1916E 625; and Lodge Room Co. v. Pacific Bond & Inv. Co., 84 Wash. 150, 146 Pac. 376; tend towards the same results. The rider already quoted seems to fortify this view, since it permits of a refund of rental only in case of fire or dispossession without fault.\\\\nWe need not inquire as to what would have been the liability of either party if the tenant had treated the failure of the boiler as an ouster, because that question is not here.\\\\nThough the law may seem harsh as applied to this particular case, yet, for the general good, it must be maintained, and landlords and tenants alike must he left to guard against unusual conditions by the terms of their contracts.\\\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\\\nMain, C.

A trial upon the merits in that court, sitting with a jury, resulted in verdict and judgment awarding to Miller and wife recovery against the lumber company in the sum of $750, from which it has appealed to this court.\\\\nReversal of the judgment and dismissal of the action are sought upon the sole ground that the evidence does not support the awarding of any recovery to Miller and wife, and that the trial court should have so decided as a matter of law in response to .appropriate motions made in that behalf.\\\\nThe controlling facts, admitted or shown by the evidence introduced in behalf of Miller and wife, may be fairly summarized as follows: The lumber company was the owner of the apartment house at all times in question. Mrs. Simmons was the lumber company\\\\u2019s managing agent of the apartment house, which agency included authority on her part to rent the apartments to tenants and to collect rent therefor. Mrs. Simmons \\\\u2019 husband was the engineer of the apartment house.\\\\nOn September 23, Mrs. Simmons rented the furnished apartment No. 317 to Miller and wife, receiving therefor one month\\\\u2019s rent in advance. They moved into the apartment on that day. They inspected the apartment, including the bathroom, and there did not then appear any defect in the plastering of the bathroom ceiling. This was the beginning of a month-to-month tenancy for ordinary housekeeping purposes.\\\\nOn Thursday, October 16, Mr. Miller first noticed a defect in the plastering of the bathroom ceiling. He testified as to what was then said and done with reference thereto, as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cQ. Did you get in touch with the management of the building that evening? A. Yes, sir. Q.

Well) when I called up the first time I thought it was Mrs. Simmons, but the lady who answered the phone said that Mrs. Simmons was not in, and that she would tell her as soon as she did come in. An hour later the phone rang again, she says \\\\u2018What is the trouble, Mr. Miller? This is Mrs. Simmons speaking.\\\\u2019 I says, \\\\u2018The plaster in the bathroom is cracked. I want to report it to you.\\\\u2019 She said she would have Mr. Simmons take care of it right away.\\\\u201d\\\\nThere is no further evidence in the record as to the nature or extent of the then defect in the bathroom ceiling plaster.\\\\nNothing was done about the matter until the forenoon of Saturday, October 18. As to what was then done, Mr. Miller testified that, during that evening, after the accident, Mrs. Simmons said to him: \\\\u201cMr. Simmons and I went up this morning to look at the plaster. We thought it would be safe until Monday.\\\\u201d There is no other testimony as to the then condition of the plaster.\\\\nMr. and Mrs. Miller were both employed in business vocations, taking them away from the apartment during the business hours of the day. They came home to the apartment that evening as usual. A short time thereafter, Mrs. Miller went into the bathroom, and, when she had come to near the center of the bathroom, a section of the ceiling plaster, about fourteen by twenty inches, fell, inflicting upon her the injuries in question. Mr. and Mrs. Simmons, in response to a call from the apartment, came very soon thereafter. It was soon thereafter that Mrs. Simmons told Mr. Miller of the inspection of the plaster by herself and Mr. Simmons that morning.\\\\nIt is the settled rule of law in this state, prevailing generally in the United States and England, that,\\\\n\\\\u201c . . . in the absence of express contract to the contrary, a tenant takes the demised premises as he finds them and there is no implied warranty by the landlord that they are safe or fit for the purpose for which they are hired. The maxim caveat emptor applies.\\\\u201d Mesher v. Osborne, 75 Wash. 439, 134 Pac. 1092, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 917.\\\\nSee Larson v. Eldridge, 153 Wash. 23, 279 Pac. 120, and our prior decisions therein noticed. This rule was in that case held applicable to a resident tenant of an apartment in an apartment house, as well as to a resident tenant of the whole of a separate dwelling house, when the tenant\\\\u2019s right of control and enjoyment of the apartment under Ms tenancy is as complete and exclusive as it would be under an ordinary tenancy of a separate dwelling house.\\\\nThe original tenancy contract did not contain any promise by or for the lumber company to make any repairs in the apartment. The original tenancy contract did not contain any warranty by or for the landlord that the apartment was safe and fit for the purpose for which it was rented to the tenant. The original tenancy contract gave Miller and wife as complete and exclusive right of control and enjoyment of the apartment as if it were a tenancy of a separate dwelling house.\\\\nIt is argued that the original tenancy contract impliedly put upon the lumber company a contractual duty of repair, because of a custom to that effect in the management of apartment houses in Seattle, of such notoriety that the court should take judicial notice thereof and construe the original tenancy contract accordingly. Our decision in Larson v. Eldridge, 153 Wash. 23, 279 Pac. 120, is decisive against this contention.\\\\nThe fact that the apartment was- rented to Miller and wife, furnished, by the lumber company is stressed by their counsel as tending to evidence a tenancy of a somewhat different nature than an ordinary tenancy of a dwelling house or an unfurnished apartment. There is that difference between this tenancy and the tenancy involved in Larson v. Eldridge, 153 Wash. 23, 279 Pac. 120. But we are of the opinion that such difference in the tenancies does not furnish any substantial ground for recognizing any distinction between the legal relation of the landlord and tenant in that case and the legal relation of the landlord and tenant in this case.\\\\nThese considerations, we think, call for the conclusion that the tenants, Miller and wife, do not have any right of recovery against their landlord, the lumber company, rested upon any breach of their original tenancy contract.\\\\nIt is contended in behalf of Miller and wife that the lumber company, in any event, incurred a contractual obligation to them to repair the ceiling of the bathroom upon its manager, Mrs. Simmons, being advised by Mr. Miller, on October 16, that the plaster of the bathroom was cracked, and her reply that she would have Mr. Simmons take care of it right away. In the text of 16 B>. C. L. 1033, we read:\\\\n\\\\u201cIt has frequently been held that the landlord is under no obligation to make repairs, unless such a stipulation is made a part of the original contract, and that any subsequent promise to make repairs, founded merely on the relation of the parties, and not one of the conditions of the lease, is without consideration, and for that reason creates no liability. According to some decisions a mere promise by the landlord to repair, based alone upon the tenant\\\\u2019s agreement not to abandon the demised premises before the end of his term, is without consideration, and cannot be enforced, but there is also authority .to the effect that although a landlord is not bound originally to repair the premises, if the tenant notifies him that the premises are defective and threatens to vacate, and the landlord thereupon promises to make repairs, he is liable to the tenant for a failure to make such repairs. Even though a gratuitous executory contract of this kind would not be binding on the landlord, he would place himself in a very different position if he should see fit to treat it as binding, and actually enter upon its fulfilment. He is at liberty to repudiate it, or to perform it at his option, but if his choice should be to perform it he comes under some measure of liability as to the manner of its performance.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis is not a case of a repair contract obligation arising after the commencement of the tenancy between the landlord and tenant by reason of the landlord\\\\u2019s promise to repair and the tenant\\\\u2019s promise to remain in consideration thereof; nor by reason of the promise to repair in response to the tenant\\\\u2019s threat to move if the landlord does not repair; .nor by the landlord\\\\u2019s actually assuming an obligation to repair by actually commencing such repairs before the accident occurs.\\\\nIt seems plain to us that this mere notice by Mr. Miller to Mrs. Simmons, the lumber company\\\\u2019s manager of the apartment house, and her response above noticed, did not give rise to any new contract repair obligation on the part of the lumber company; and that therefore the lumber company is not liable for the breach of any such claimed contract.\\\\nDid the lumber company become liable in damages as -for a tort liability in its failure to repair and make safe the ceiling of the bathroom prior to the occurrence of Mrs. Miller\\\\u2019s injury? It may be conceded that the lumber company might become so liable* if the defect in the ceiling had existed at the time of the commencement of the tenancy and was then known to or should have been known to the lumber company as being of a character likely to damage someone who might rightfully be in the bathroom either as a tenant or a lawful invitee therein. There is no evidence in this record pointing to any defect in the plastering at the time of the commencement of the tenancy. Whatever defect there was of that nature manifestly occurred thereafter, and did not become noticeable until well towards the expiration of the first month of the tenancy, that is, on October 16, when Mr. Miller first noticed it; evidently being the one to first discover it.\\\\nIn Howard v. Washington Water Power Co., 75 Wash. 255, 134 Pac. 927, 52 L. R. A. (N. S.) 578, the injury to the tenant was caused by a dangerous condition of an electric light switch, known to the landlord when the tenancy commenced, and not disclosed t\\\\u00f3 the tenant. The landlord was held liable for damages to the tenant as for tort, it being assumed that there was no agreement to repair. Mesher v. Osborne, 75 Wash. 439, 134 Pac. 1092, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 917, was a somewhat similar case wherein the landlord was held liable. In that case, Judge Ellis, speaking for the court, said:\\\\n\\\\u201cTo the general rule of the landlord\\\\u2019s nonliability for injury from defects, there is the well recognized exception that, even in the absence of warranty or express agreement by the landlord to repair, he is liable to the tenant or the tenant\\\\u2019s guest as for a tort, where, with actual knowledge of obscure defects or dangers at the time of the letting, he lets the premises without disclosing such defects to a tenant who does not know, and by the exercise of reasonable care would not discover them. The duty to disclose such latent defects and dangers when actually known to the landlord exists without regard to any covenant or lack of covenant to repair. But in the absence of such covenant, there is no duty of inspection on the landlord\\\\u2019s part to discover latent and unknown defects. 3 Shearman & Redfield, Negligence (6th ed.), \\\\u00a7709; Moore v.

O\\\\u2019Brien, 77 Wash. 677, 138 Pac. 295, the landlord promised repair of the premises in response to his tenant\\\\u2019s saying to him that, if he did not fix the house and make it safe, she would have to move out. This was, in substance, a promise by the landlord, supported by an implied promise of tbe tenant to remand if the repair would soon be made. It was beld tbat tbe tenant was absolved from tbe charge of assumption of risk because sbe remained a short time awaiting\\\\u2019 tbe landlord\\\\u2019s fulfilment of bis promise, during which time sbe was injured because of bis failure in tbat regard.\\\\nIn Johnson v. Dye, 131 Wash. 637, 230 Pac. 625, the landlord, at tbe beginning of tbe tenancy, assumed tbe contractual obligation of keeping tbe premises in repair. Tbe landlord was beld liable, as for tort, for damage to tbe tenant resulting from latent defects in tbe support of tbe steps which would have been readily discovered by him bad be fulfilled bis obligation to repair tbe steps, as prior to tbe accident was several times demanded of him by tbe tenant.\\\\nIn McCourtie v. Bayton, 159 Wash. 418, 294 Pac. 238, the damage occurred by reason of negligence of tbe landlord in leaving a portion of tbe premises in a dangerous condition while be was actually engaged in repairing tbe premises. Tbe landlord was beld liable to the tenant so damaged as for tort.\\\\nThese decisions, principally relied upon by- counsel for Miller and wife, touching tbe question of tbe lumber company\\\\u2019s tort liability, we think, do not support their contention in. that behalf. No decision has come to our notice bolding a landlord liable in damages to tbe tenant as for tort where, as in this case, there was no contractual obligation to repair in the original tenancy contract or in any subsequent contract, and no known dangerous defect in tbe premises at tbe time of tbe commencement of tbe tenancy, nor any dangerous defect in tbe premises at any time known to tbe landlord and not known to tbe tenant.\\\\nWe conclude tbat tbe landlord, tbe lumber company, is not liable to Miller and wife, its tenants, either upon the theory of breach of any contractual obligation or upon the theory of any tort obligation. The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded to the superior court with directions to dismiss the action.\\\\nMitchell, Beeler, and Millard, JJ., concur.\",\"type\":\"majority\",\"author\":\"Parker, J.\"},{\"text\":\"Tolman, C.

Hutch-ins for an ice cream and soda fountain business. November 30, 1955, the lease was assigned to Arthur A. Riebli and George Hoertrich, Jr., with the consent of the building company. During the weekend prior to October 29, 1956, a water pipe imbedded in the cementlike floor of the leased premises ruptured. Monday morning at 7:30 a. m., the maintenance superintendent of the building company discovered that the basement of the building had been flooded. The flow of water from the ruptured pipe was shut off by a valve which controlled the service of water to the leased premises. The water caused damage to some doors stored by the building company in a basement storeroom, to merchandise stored by the Washington Camera Mart in its basement storeroom, and to a rug on the floor in the basement safe-deposit vault lobby of the United Mutual Savings Bank.\\\\nThe Washington Camera Mart brought suit against Riebli and Hoertrich to recover for its loss. The bank sued Riebli, Hoertrich, and the building company. The building company cross-complained against Riebli and Hoertrich for damages to its doors and for indemnity for any damages it might be required to pay to the bank. The causes were consolidated for trial.\\\\nThe court entered judgment for both plaintiffs and also entered judgment for the building company on its cross-complaint. Riebli and Hoertrich have appealed.\\\\nThe evidence disclosed, inter alia, (1) that the respondents\\\\u2019 premises were damaged by water; (2) that the water came from a ruptured pipe imbedded in the cementlike floor of the premises leased by the appellants; (3) that the pipe was installed in 1947, with the consent of the building company, by a former tenant when he remodeled the premises, and had since remained untouched; (4) that water was supplied by the building company to the appellants\\\\u2019 premises through a system of pipes which it maintained and over which it retained control, the water being piped to a reservoir on the top floor of the building and from there to the various parts of the building; (5) that the appellants were not assignees of Fox, who had installed the pipe, but were in possession as the assignees of the Hutchins lease, and (6) that the lease provided that the tenants had the duty to keep the leased premises in repair and, under certain conditions, to save the building company harmless from occupational liability.\\\\nThe court predicated appellants\\\\u2019 liability to the Washington Camera Mart and to the bank upon the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. The court erred in applying the doctrine to the facts of this case.\\\\nBefore the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur can be applied, exclusive control of the offending instrumentality by the appellants must be established by the evidence. In this regard, Prosser on Torts (2d ed.) 204, \\\\u00a7 42, states the rule as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is never enough for the plaintiff to prove merely that he has been injured by the negligence of someone unidentified. Even though there is beyond all possible doubt negligence in the air, it is still necessary to bring it home to the defendant. On this too the plaintiff has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence; and in any case where it is clear that it is at least equally probable that the negligence was that of another, the court must instruct the jury that the plaintiff has not proved his case. . . .\\\\n\\\\u201cThis element usually is stated as meaning that the defendant must be in \\\\u2018exclusive control\\\\u2019 of the instrumentality which has caused the accident. . . .\\\\n\\\\u201c. . . It would be far better, and much confusion would be avoided, if the idea of \\\\u2018control\\\\u2019 were discarded altogether, and we were to say merely that the apparent cause of the accident must be such that the defendant would be responsible for any negligence connected with it.\\\\u201d\\\\nIn Morner v. Union Pac. R. Co., 31 Wn. (2d) 282, 294, 196 P. (2d) 744 (1948), this court said:\\\\n\\\\u201c . . . one of the elements essential to the invocation of that doctrine [res ipsa loquitur] is that the party charged with actionable negligence must have sole and exclusive control of the agency or instrumentality which actually caused the injury. If there is no such exclusive control, or if the injury was caused, or may reasonably be said to have been caused, by the concurrent acts of two or more persons or agencies functioning independently of each other, the doctrine does not apply.\\\\u201d\\\\nAccord, 1 Shearman and Redfield, Negligence (Rev. ed.) 153, \\\\u00a7 56; 65 C. J. S. 1014 et seq., \\\\u00a7 220 (8).\\\\nIn Hogland v. Klein, 49 Wn. (2d) 216, 298 P. (2d) 1099 (1956), we recognized that the requirement of control does not mean actual physical control, but refers to legal control or responsibility for the proper and efficient functioning of the instrumentality that caused the injury.\\\\nUnder the facts of this case, was the offending pipe under the exclusive control of the appellants?\\\\nRespondents rely upon Kind v. Seattle, 50 Wn. (2d) 485, 312 P. (2d) 811 (1957). In the cited case, a water main was held to be under the \\\\u201cexclusive control\\\\u201d of the city, when it was installed by the city, maintained by the city up to and at the time of the accident, and the water was supplied by the city. See, also, Klise v. Seattle, 52 Wn. (2d) 412, 325 P. (2d) 888 (1958).\\\\nIn the instant case, the appellants did not install the offending pipe. They did not select the kind or quality of pipe used. They had no control over the water supply. The evidence failed to establish the element of \\\\u201cexclusive control,\\\\u201d which is a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.\\\\nFurther, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is based in part upon the theory that negligence will be presumed because the defendant either knew of the cause of the accident, or had the best opportunity of ascertaining the cause and, therefore, should be required to produce evidence in explanation. Shay v. Parkhurst, 38 Wn. (2d) 341, 229 P. (2d) 510 (1951); Morner v. Union Pac. R. Co., supra; Lynch v. Ninemire Packing Co., 63 Wash. 423, 115 Pac. 838 (1911).\\\\nIn this case, there was no proof that the appellants had prior knowledge of the cause of the accident or that they had the best opportunity to know of it. When they took possession of the premises, the imbedded pipe was in place and had remained there untouched during their occupancy.\\\\nThere remains the question of whether the judgment in favor of the Washington Building Company and against the appellants can be sustained because of the following provisions of the lease:\\\\n\\\\u201cThe Parties Hereto Further Agree, As Follows: . . .\\\\n\\\\u201c(2) Throughout the term of this lease, the Lessee will take good care of the demised premises and appurtenances, alterations and improvements, and will keep same in good repair, and at or before the end of the term will repair all injury done by the installation or removal of equipment and fixtures, it being understood that the Lessee shall have the right to remove equipment and fixtures; and, at the end of the term, the Lessee will quit and surrender the demised premises, with all alterations and improvements, in good order and condition, reasonable wear and damage by the elements excepted. . . .\\\\n\\\\u201c(6) The Lessor shall not be liable for damage caused the Lessee by bursting or leaking of any water, gas, or steam pipe by accident or by neglect of other tenants or occupants of the building or their employees. . . .\\\\n\\\\u201c (8) The Lessor shall have the right to enter the premises at reasonable times and intervals to examine the same or to make repairs or alterations. . . .\\\\n\\\\u201c(11) The Lessee agrees to use the leased premises as a careful and prudent person would use his own, and upon the expiration of the term to surrender the premises to the Lessor in as good condition as at the beginning of the term of this lease, save for wear and tear from reasonable and careful use. . . .\\\\n\\\\u201c (14) The Lessee shall keep, save and hold harmless the Lessor from any and all damages and liability for anything and everything whatsoever arising from, or out of the occupancy by, or under, the Lessee, the Lessee\\\\u2019s agents or servants, and from any loss or damage arising from any fault or negligence by the Lessee, or any failure on the Lessee\\\\u2019s part to comply with any of the covenants, terms and conditions herein contained, or otherwise, or whether it be caused by, or be due to, the failure of the Lessee to perform any of the covenants herein, expressed or implied, that are to be performed by the Lessee.\\\\u201d\\\\nRespondents rely upon \\\\u00a7 14, supra. Liability under that section of the lease arises upon (1) appellants\\\\u2019 failure to comply with the terms of the lease, and (2) damages arising from or out of appellants\\\\u2019 occupancy of the premises.\\\\nAs to (1), it was not shown that appellants failed to comply with the terms of the lease. Regarding (2), we are of the opinion that, construing the contract as a whole, the parties intended that the appellants were obligated to \\\\u201ctake good care\\\\u201d of the leased premises during their occupancy, and to make a reasonable and careful use thereof. They were liable only for damage caused by unreasonable and careless use of the premises. The imbedded pipe in some manner ruptured during the appellants\\\\u2019 occupancy. The fact of the rupture alone does not establish that the use of the premises by the appellants was unreasonable or careless. The burden of proving that the water damage was caused by appellants\\\\u2019 failure to comply with the terms and covenants of the lease, or by their unreasonable use of the premises, was not met by the respondents.\\\\nNor does the covenant (\\\\u00a72, supra) which placed upon the appellants the duty to repair make them insurers of latent defects in the premises. The covenant to repair carries with it no more than the duty to repair known defects or defects which could have been discovered by the exercise of due care. Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co., 79 Wash. 643, 140 Pac. 909 (1914); Bernhard v. Reeves, 6 Wash. 424, 33 Pac. 873 (1893).\\\\nThere is no evidence in the record before us that the defect was known to the appellants or that appellants, by the exercise of due care, could have discovered it. The proof established nothing more than a latent defect for which appellants assumed no contractual liability.\\\\nFinally, respondents contend that the offending pipe was a trade fixture. Assuming, arguendo, that the pipe, at the time it was installed by the then tenant, Fox, was a trade fixture and so regarded by Fox and the owner of the building, it lost its identity as a trade fixture and became part of the building when it was leased by the owner as a part of the over-all premises to the appellants\\\\u2019 assignor, Hutchins.\\\\n\\\\u201c \\\\u2018The true criterion of a fixture is the united application of these requisites: (1) Actual annexation to the realty, or something appurtenant thereto; (2) application to the use or purpose to which that part of the realty with which it is connected is appropriated; and (3) the intention of the party making the annexation to make a permanent accession to the freehold.\\\\u2019 \\\\u201d Forman v. Columbia Theater Co., 20 Wn. (2d) 685, 695, 148 P. (2d) 951 (1944), quoting with approval from Filley v. Christopher, 39 Wash. 22, 80 Pac. 834 (1905).\\\\nApplying these tests to the facts in the instant case, the pipe was securely imbedded in the concretelike floor, and was applied to the use of these premises as an ice cream parlor and soda fountain. The actual intention of Fox, who made the annexation, does not appear, but, from the above and from the fact that he did not remove it at the termination of his lease, we must presume that his intention was to make the pipe a permanent annexation to the freehold. Under these facts, it is clear that the pipe became a permanent part of the building company\\\\u2019s water supply system and was leased as a part of the freehold to appellants\\\\u2019 assignor.\\\\nFor the reasons stated, the judgments are reversed, and the causes remanded with instructions to enter judgments dismissing the complaints and the cross-complaint.\\\\nWeaver, C. J., Hill, Donworth, Finley, and Foster, JJ., concur.\",\"type\":\"majority\",\"author\":\"Ott, J.\"},{\"text\":\"Hunter, J.\\\\n(dissenting)\\\\u2014A more detailed statement of the facts is necessary to better understand the reasoning of this dissent.\\\\nThe record discloses that the appellant lessees, in the conduct of their business, maintained and operated a motor-driven compressor as a part of their refrigeration equipment situated within the premises, which compressor required a constant supply of water for cooling purposes; that the lessees, in the conduct of their business, obtained water from the Building Company for various uses on their premises, for which they paid a monthly flat fee to the lessor; that they obtained their water supply by means of an entrance pipe through the floor of their premises, connected to the general building water supply system.\\\\nThe testimony in the record, which the trial court was entitled to believe, discloses that immediately inside appellants\\\\u2019 premises on the entrance pipe was a hand-operated control valve by which the flow of water beyond that point could be turned off and on; that from that point on water was distributed to the various points of use within appellants\\\\u2019 premises by plumbing installed by previous tenants; that in order to supply cold water to the appellants\\\\u2019 refrigeration compressor, a pipe, connected with the other plumbing within the premises, was placed under the surface of the floor of their premises; that the floor was laid by a prior tenant; that the flow of water in the pipe was controlled by the same valve within the premises that controlled the flow through the rest of the plumbing; that one of the appellants, George Hoertrich, Jr., was the electrical contractor for the tenant who installed the floor and pipe, and did the electrical work incident to the installation of the compressor, which was the same compressor situated on the premises maintained and operated by the appellants, when the accident occurred on October 29,1956. The record further shows that the pipe was installed on the floor of the premises by being laid upon or partially recessed therein, and was covered with a one\\' to two-inch terrazzo floor, which is a type of floor laid similar to concrete with the same hardening characteristics; that the original floor was of twelve-inch reinforced concrete, and beneath this floor there is an area of approximately two feet followed by a false ceiling suspended over respondents\\\\u2019 premises. The space between the false ceiling and the concrete floor contains various utilities for the building. In its determination of the source of the escaping water, the trial court found that it resulted from a rupture in the pipeline in the terrazzo floor.\\\\nIn view of the result of this dissent, it is necessary to discuss certain contentions of the appellants in addition to those considered by the majority. Hence, for continuity, all of the appellants\\\\u2019 contentions will be discussed in order, without reference to the majority opinion.\\\\nAppellants contend first, that the evidence is insufficient to support the court\\\\u2019s finding that the instrumentality causing the damage was from a rupture of the pipe in the floor of appellants\\\\u2019 premises. I disagree. The building superintendent testified that the water was running through the ceiling directly beneath the appellants\\\\u2019 premises when the damage was discovered; that there was no other plumbing in that area except the appellants\\\\u2019 plumbing; and that he immediately notified the appellants. The record shows that the appellants thereupon called a plumber who shut off the water at the valve through which the water flows into the appellants\\\\u2019 plumbing from the line of the building supplying the water to appellants\\\\u2019 premises. The water leakage promptly subsided. The plumber bypassed the pipe in the floor, which went to the appellants\\\\u2019 compressor, with copper tubing to carry the water and there was no further difficulty encountered. The building superintendent further testified that, based on his years of experience in maintenance and plumbing work, he believed the break could be caused by a chemical reaction between the galvanizing of the pipe and the concrete floor.\\\\nConsidering the testimony in its entirety and the inferences to be drawn therefrom, there is sufficient evidence to support the trial court\\\\u2019s finding that the instrumentality causing the damage was a ruptured pipe in the floor of appellants\\\\u2019 premises.\\\\nThe appellants further contend the trial court erred in finding that the appellants had exclusive possession and control of the premises and the instrumentality causing the damage. The appellants contend the control was in the lessor. I believe an examination of the record discloses the contrary. The lease expressly provides:\\\\n\\\\u201cThroughout the term of this lease, the lessee will take good care of the demised premises and appurtenances, alterations and improvements, and will keep the same in good repair, . . . and, at the end of the term, the lessee will quit and surrender the demised premises, with all alterations and improvements, in good order and condition, reasonable wear and damage by the elements excepted.\\\\u201d (Italics mine.)\\\\nThe court found, as supported by the record, that the ruptured pipe was a part of the plumbing used exclusively in the operation of the appellants\\\\u2019 business. The pipe could be used for that purpose only, and was not in any manner related to the use of the remainder of the building. The ruptured pipe was clearly a part of, and appurtenant to the use of, the demised premises, which the appellants were bound to maintain and repair under the lease and over which they necessarily had control under these circumstances. The appellants argue, however, that they did not have exclusive control since they could not disturb the terrazzo floor without permission of the lessor, on the theory that it would constitute an alteration requiring the consent of the lessor, as provided in the lease. I disagree. The lease must be read in its entirety. The disturbing of the floor would only be an incident to the appellants\\\\u2019 obligation to repair the pipe and would not be an alteration, since the restoration of the floor would be required under the provision of the lease providing for the surrender of the premises in good order and condition at the end of the term (reasonable wear and damage by the elements excepted).\\\\nThe appellants further contend that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is not applicable in this case. The doctrine was recently considered by this court in the case of Klise v. Seattle, 52 Wn. (2d) 412, 325 P. (2d) 888 (1958). There we stated:\\\\n\\\\u201cUnder our recent decision in Kind v. Seattle, 50 Wn. (2d) 485, 312 P. (2d) 811, the rule is:\\\\n\\\\u201c Where a plaintiff\\\\u2019s evidence establishes that an instrumentality under the exclusive control of the defendants caused an injurious occurrence, which ordinarily does not happen if those in control of the instrumentality use ordinary care, there is an inference, permissible from the occurrence itself, that it was caused by the defendant\\\\u2019s want of care. Nopson v. Wockner, 40 Wn. (2d) 645, 245 P. (2d) 1022. Legal control or responsibility for the proper and efficient functioning of the instrumentality which caused the injury and a superior, if not exclusive, position for knowing or obtaining knowledge of the facts which caused the injury, provide a sufficient basis for the application of the doctrine. Hogland v. Klein, 49 Wn. (2d) 216, 298 P. (2d) 1099. When these circumstances are shown, the plaintiff has made a prima facie case, and it devolves upon the defendant to produce evidence to meet and offset the effect of the presumption. Hogland v. Klein, supra.\\\\u2019 \\\\u201d (Italics mine.)\\\\nIn the instant case, finding of fact No. 9 reads as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cThat the Defendants, Arthur Riebli and George Hoertrich, Jr., had exclusive possession and control of the premises and the instrumentality causing said damage, and that the cause of said occurrence has not been satisfactorily explained, nor have said Defendants shown that they exercised due care to prevent the happening of the occurrence or excused themselves for their failure to do so.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe above finding, which is supported by the record, shows that (1) the appellants had exclusive control of the instrumentality causing the damage; (2) that no showing was made by the appellants of their exercise of due care to prevent the occurrence causing the damage; and (3) that no explanation has been made by the appellants to excuse them from failing to exercise due care in the control and operation of the instrumentality causing the damage.\\\\nUnder the facts in the instant case, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, as stated in the Klise case, supra, applies. The appellants have failed to produce evidence to offset the effect of the presumption of the appellants\\\\u2019 want of due care and they should therefore be liable for the damage incurred.\\\\nThe appellants contend the court erred in awarding judgment for damages to the building on the Building Company\\\\u2019s cross-complaint against the appellants, and in awarding the Building Company a judgment against the appellants for any damages it may sustain as a result of the judgment obtained by the Bank against the Building Company and the appellants. I do not agree. The covenant under the lease expressly provides the lessees will hold the lessor harmless from any and all damages occurring to the lessor whatsoever, as a result of the lessees\\\\u2019 use and occupancy of the premises. The lease states:\\\\n\\\\u201cThe lessee shall keep, save and hold harmless the lessor from any and all damages and liability for anything and everything whatsoever arising from, or out of, the occupancy by, or under, the lessee, the lessee\\\\u2019s agents or servants, and from any loss or damage arising from any fault or negligence by the lessee, or any failure on the lessee\\\\u2019s part to comply with any of the covenants, terms and conditions herein contained, or otherwise, or whether it be caused by, or be due to, the failure of the lessee to perform any of the covenants herein, expressed or implied, that are to be performed by the lessee.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe damage sustained by the Building Company, as alleged in the cross-complaint, and resulting from the judgment obtained by the Bank against the Building Company and the appellants, was a direct result of the lessees\\\\u2019 use and occupancy of its premises, and the court was therefore correct in its ruling.\\\\nThe appellants contend the court erred in awarding damages to the Washington Camera Mart for the loss of anticipated profits from the Christmas business of that year. The trial court was justified in finding that, as a result of the damage occurring on October 29,1956, there was insufficient time for any of the stock of damaged merchandise to be replaced. The finding of lost profits was properly supported by the record, showing that the Camera Mart had been in operation since 1946, and that the Christmas seasons of 1955 and 1956 were comparable as far as general Christmas buisness was concerned.\\\\nFinding no error in the record, the trial court should be affirmed.\\\\nMallery and Rosellini, JJ., concur with Hunter, J.\",\"type\":\"dissent\",\"author\":\"Hunter, J.\"}],\"attorneys\":[\"Lycette, Diamond & Sylvester and James A.

Foisy, is seeking the possession of his real property, unpaid rent and damages. The defendant (appellant), Richard Kent Wyman, appeals from a judgment in favor of the plaintiff.\\\\nIn his complaint, the plaintiff alleged in effect; (1) That on December 31, 1970, the defendant took possession of a house which the plaintiff is seeking to recover, pursuant to a 6-month lease requiring $300 to be paid for said term, plus water and other utility charges; (2) that during the term of the lease the defendant paid the sum of $95, leaving $205 still owing for the 6-month period; (3) that the defendant remained upon the premises after the expiration of the lease; (4) that the rental payment after the expiration of the lease was to be $75 per month; (5) that after the defendant refused to pay the accrued rent, the plaintiff served a 3-day notice to pay rent or vacate upon the defendant on August 27, 1971; (6) that the defendant failed to pay any of the amounts owing after the 3-day notice was served upon him.\\\\nThe defendant\\\\u2019s answer raised several affirmative defenses including breach of implied warranty of habitability.\\\\nDuring trial the defendant testified that he took possession of the house on March 3, 1971. It appears that the parties executed the lease in question on March 8, 1971, although the lease was dated December 31, 1970, and was to cover a term of 6 months, which was to commence on January 1,1971, and end on June 30,1971.\\\\nThe lease in question also contained an option to purchase. The testimony of the defendant indicates that he thought he was purchasing the house rather than renting it. His testimony also indicates that the house contained a number of defects when he entered into the lease and it indicates that he was aware of some of the defects when he agreed to rent the house, but not all of them.\\\\nThe trial court concluded that the defendant was guilty of unlawful detainer of the premises rented to him by the plaintiff. However, it refused to enforce the provisions of what it termed the \\\\u201cpurported lease.\\\\u201d It found that the reasonable rental for the period of occupancy of the premises was the sum of $50 per month commencing with March 3, 1971, until such time as the defendant removed himself. In effect, the court held the lease was invalid. The court also held that a writ of restitution should issue to the sheriff to require the surrender of possession if the defendant did not voluntarily withdraw and that damages for the period March 3, 1971, through April 3, 1972, were to be doubled if the defendant did not surrender the premises by April 3, 1972. The defendant appeals, although the plaintiff does not cross-appeal from the court\\\\u2019s findings.\\\\nThe primary contention raised by the defendant is that the trial court erred in refusing to accept evidence as to his affirmative defense of breach of implied warranty of habitability. The defendant argues that the plaintiff\\\\u2019s failure to maintain the premises in a habitable condition constitutes a failure of consideration upon the part of the plaintiff and relieves the defendant of his obligation to pay rent. We agree that the tenant should have been permitted to introduce evidence at trial in support of this theory of defense.\\\\nThe premises in question, according to the testimony of the defendant, contained a number of defects including a lack of heat, no hot water tank, broken windows, a broken door, water running through the bedroom, an improperly seated and leaking toilet, a leaking sink in the bathroom, broken water pipes in the yard and termites in the basement. No objection was made to the introduction of this testimony. The testimony of the defendant also indicates that he painted the interior and made repairs upon the premises, but ceased making repairs when he learned of a municipal court action being initiated against the plaintiff as a result of numerous housing code violations within the house. In addition, the record reveals that the landlord was informed of the defects and was prosecuted successfully for violations of the Seattle housing code.\\\\nDuring the trial the defendant attempted to introduce the testimony of two housing inspectors as to the housing code violations which existed on the premises. The trial court sustained the plaintiff\\\\u2019s objections to this testimony upon the theory that the condition of the premises was not relevant to the issue before the court. We disagree with the reasoning of the trial court in refusing to accept the evidence as to the condition of the premises, although it should be stated that this issue has not been heretofore specifically addressed in this jurisdiction in relation to our unlawful detainer statutes.\\\\nThroughout the United States, the old rule of caveat emptof in the leasing of premises has been undergoing judicial scrutiny.\\\\nIn Pines v. Perssion, 14 Wis. 2d 590, 596, 111 N.W.2d 409 (1961), the court stated:\\\\nTo follow the old rule of no implied warranty of habitability in leases would, in our opinion, be inconsistent with the current legislative policy concerning housing standards. The need and social desirability of adequate housing for people in this era of rapid population increases is too important to be rebuffed by that obnoxious legal clich\\\\u00e9, caveat emptor. Permitting landlords to rent \\\\u201ctumble-down\\\\u201d houses is at least a contributing cause of such problems as urban blight, juvenile delinquency, and high property taxes for conscientious landowners.\\\\nSee Reste Realty Corp. v. Cooper, 53 N.J. 444, 251 A.2d 268 (1969); Marini v. Ireland, 56 N.J. 130, 265 A.2d 526 (1970); Lemle v. Breeden, 51 Hawaii 426, 462 P.2d 470 (1969); Javins v. First Nat\\\\u2019l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925, 27 L. Ed. 2d 185, 91 S. Ct. 186 (1970), and Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill. 2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).\\\\nIn Lemle v. Breeden, supra, the court reviewed the rule of caveat emptor and the current trend toward finding an implied warranty of habitability in leases, and stated on page 433:\\\\nThe application of an implied warranty of habitability in leases gives recognition to the changes in leasing transactions today. It affirms the fact that a lease is, in essence, a sale as well as a transfer of an estate in land and is, more importantly, a contractual relationship. From that contractual relationship an implied warranty of habitability and fitness for the purposes intended is a just and necessary implication. It is a doctrine which has its counterparts in the law of sales and torts and one which when candidly countenanced is impelled by the nature of the transaction and contemporary housing realities. Legal fictions and artificial exceptions to wooden rules of property law aside, we hold that in the lease of a dwelling house, such as in this case, there is an implied warranty of habitability and fitness for the use intended.\\\\n(Footnote omitted.)\\\\nIn Javins v. First Nat\\\\u2019l Realty Corp., supra, the court analyzed the various exceptions to the common-law rule that the lessor has no duty to repair and stated on page 1078:\\\\nThese as well as other similar cases demonstrate that some courts began some time ago to question the common law\\\\u2019s assumptions that the land was the most important feature of a leasehold and that the tenant could feasibly make any necessary repairs himself. Where those assumptions no longer reflect contemporary housing patterns, the courts have created exceptions to the general rule that landlords have no duty to keep their premises in repair.\\\\nIt is overdue for courts to admit that these assumptions are no longer true with regard to all urban housing. Today\\\\u2019s urban tenants, the vast majority of whom live in multiple dwelling houses, are interested, not in the land, but solely in \\\\u201ca house suitable for occupation.\\\\u201d Furthermore, today\\\\u2019s city dweller usually has a single, specialized skill unrelated to maintenance work; he is unable to make repairs like the \\\\u201cjack-of-all-trades\\\\u201d farmer who was the common law\\\\u2019s model of the lessee. Further, unlike his agrarian predecessor who often remained on one piece of land for his entire life, urban tenants today are more mobile than ever before. A tenant\\\\u2019s tenure in a specific apartment will often not be sufficient to justify efforts at repairs. In addition, the increasing complexity of today\\\\u2019s dwellings renders them much more difficult to repair than the structures of earlier times. In a multiple dwelling repair may require access to equipment and areas in the control of the landlord. Low and middle income tenants, even if they were interested in making repairs, would be unable to obtain any financing for major repairs since they have no long-term interest in the property.\\\\n(Footnotes omitted.)\\\\nWe find the reasoning of these cases extremely persuasive. Any realistic analysis of the lessor-lessee or landlord-tenant situation leads to the conclusion that the tenant\\\\u2019s promise to pay rent is in exchange for the landlord\\\\u2019s promise to provide a livable dwelling. As Judge Skelly Wright stated in the Javins case on page 1074:\\\\nWhen American city dwellers, both rich and poor, seek \\\\u201cshelter\\\\u201d today, they seek a well known package of goods and services \\\\u2014 a package which includes not merely walls and ceilings, but also adequate heat, light and ventilation, serviceable plumbing facilities, secure windows and doors, proper sanitation, and proper maintenance.\\\\n(Footnote omitted.) Javins v. First Nat\\'l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925, 27 L. Ed. 2d 185, 91 S. Ct. 186 (1970). The value of the lease today then, whether it is oral or written, is that it gives the tenant a place to live, and he expects not just space but a dwelling that protects him from the elements of the environment without subjecting him to health hazards.\\\\nIn House v. Thornton, 76 Wn.2d 428, 457 P.2d 199 (1969), we rejected the doctrine of caveat emptor as it applied to the sale of a new residence and found an implied warranty that the structure is fit for the buyer\\\\u2019s intended purpose. In doing so, we noted that the old rule of caveat emptor has little relevance to the sale of a brand-new house by a vendor-builder to a first buyer for the purposes of occupancy. By analogy, the old rule of caveat emptor has little relevance to the renting of premises in our society. There can be little justification for following a rule that was developed for an agrarian society and has failed to keep pace with modern day realities. We therefore hold that in all contracts for the renting of premises, oral or written, there is an implied warranty of habitability and breach of this warranty constitutes a defense in an unlawful detainer action. See Javins v. First Nat\\\\u2019l Realty Corp., supra; Lund v. MacArthur, 51 Hawaii 473, 462 P.2d 482 (1969); Marini v. Ireland, 56 N.J. 130, 265 A.2d 526 (1970); Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill. 2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).\\\\nIt can be argued, however, that the defendant should not be entitled to the protection of an implied warranty of habitability since he knew of a substantial number of defects when he rented the premises and the rent was reduced from $87 per month to $50 per month. We believe this type of bargaining by the landlord with the tenant is contrary to public policy and the purpose of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability. A disadvantaged tenant should not be placed in a position of agreeing to live in an uninhabitable premises. Housing conditions, such as the record indicates exist in the instant case, are a health hazard, not only to the individual tenant, but to the community which is exposed to said individual. As the court recognized in Pines v. Perssion, supra, such housing conditions are at least a contributing cause of such problems as urban blight, juvenile delinquency and high property taxes for the conscientious landowners.\\\\nOur belief that public policy demands such a result is reinforced by our review of Laws of 1973, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 207, which became effective July 16, 1973. The legislature in passing this bill and the Governor in signing it have recognized that public policy demands this result. Laws of 1973, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 207, provides in part:\\\\nSec. 6. The landlord will at all times during the tenancy keep the premises fit for human habitation, and shall in particular:\\\\n(1) Maintain the premises to substantially comply with any applicable code, statute, ordinance, or regulation governing their maintenance or operation, which the legislative body enacting the applicable code, statute, ordinance or regulation could enforce as to the premises rented;\\\\n(2) Maintain the roofs, floors, walls, chimneys, fireplaces, foundations, and all other structural components in reasonably good repair so as to be usable and capable of resisting any and all normal forces and loads to which they may be subjected;\\\\n(5) Except where the condition is attributable to normal wear and tear, make repairs and arrangements necessary to put and keep the premises in as good condition as it by law or rental agreement should have been, at the commencement of the tenancy;\\\\n(7) Maintain all electrical, plumbing, heating, and other facilities and appliances supplied by him in reasonably good working order;\\\\n(8) Maintain the dwelling unit in reasonably weather-tight condition;\\\\n(10) Except where the building is not equipped for the purpose, provide facilities adequate to supply heat and water and hot water as reasonably required by the tenant;\\\\nSec. 8. The tenant shall be current in the payment of rent before exercising any of th\\\\u00e9 remedies accorded him under the provisions of this chapter: Provided, That this section shall not be construed as limiting the tenant\\\\u2019s civil remedies for negligent or intentional damages: Provided Further, That this section shall not be construed as limiting the tenant\\\\u2019s right in an unlawful detainer proceeding to raise the defense that there is no rent due and owing.\\\\nSec. 10.\\\\n(6) Nothing in this section shall prevent the tenant from agreeing with the landlord to undertake the repairs himself in return for cash payment or a reasonable reduction in rent, the agreement thereof to be agreed upon between the parties, and such agreement does not alter the landlord\\\\u2019s obligations under this chapter.\\\\nIt may also be argued that the defendant should not be afforded the protection of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability since the defendant signed a lease which contained an option to purchase. However, as heretofore stated, the trial court failed to recognize the validity of the lease. There is no cross-appeal from this determination and we are therefore bound by the trial court\\\\u2019s decision.\\\\nThe plaintiff argues that the trial court was correct in disregarding the Seattle housing code as it was improperly pleaded and no properly authenticated copy of the housing code was offered. These issues were not before the court when it rejected the testimony of the housing inspectors. It was not until after the court had rejected the testimony of the housing inspectors on the basis of their testimony being irrelevant that the housing code was offered into evidence. Had the court rejected the housing code on the grounds suggested by the plaintiff, the defendant would have been in a position to move to amend his pleadings. The argument as to the housing code not being properly authenticated, we believe, is without merit in view of RCW 5.44.080 which states:\\\\nWhen the ordinances of any city or town are printed by authority of such municipal corporation, the printed copies thereof shall be received as prima facie evidence that such ordinances as printed and published were duly passed.\\\\nThe copy of the housing code that was offered into evidence by the defendant is printed by authority of the City of Seattle and is therefore prima facie evidence that the ordinances as printed and published were duly passed.\\\\nThe testimony relating to the housing code violations should have been admitted into evidence, and the trial court erred in ruling that the condition of the premises was not relevant to the issue of rent due and owing. While the housing code violations in and of themselves do not establish a prima facie case that the premises are uninhabitable, they are evidence which aids in establishing that the premises are uninhabitable.\\\\nThe plaintiff argues, in effect, however, that the unlawful detainer statutes are not designed for defenses such as breach of implied warranty of habitability due to the nature of the action. In light of our previous discussion, we believe this to be without merit.\\\\nOne of the basic issues in an unlawful detainer action of this nature is whether or not there is any rent due. RCW 59.12.170, which governs the entry of judgment and execution in an unlawful detainer action, states that upon a finding of default in the payment of rent, \\\\u201cthe judgment shall also declare the forfeiture of the lease, agreement or tenancy.\\\\u201d RCW 59.12.030 provides:\\\\nA tenant of real property for a term less than life is guilty of unlawful detainer either:\\\\n(3) When he continues in possession in person or by subtenant after a default in the payment of rent, and after notice in writing requiring in the alternative the payment of the rent or the surrender of the detained premises . . .\\\\nSince the affirmative defense of breach of implied warranty of habitability goes directly to the issue of rent due and owing, which is one of the basic issues in an unlawful detainer action as the above statutes indicate, we now hold said defense is available in an unlawful detainer action of this nature. See Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill. 2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).\\\\nThe defendant also contends that the trial court erred in rendering judgment in the instant case, since the amount demanded in the 3-day notice was more than the trial court found was actually due and owing. We disagree.\\\\nIn Provident Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Thrower, 155 Wash. 613, 617, 285 P. 654 (1930), we stated:\\\\nAs to the form and contents of the notice or demand, a substantial compliance with the statute is sufficient.\\\\nSee Sowers v. Lewis, 49 Wn.2d 891, 307 P.2d 1064 (1957). See also Erz v. Reese, 157 Wash. 32, 288 P. 255 (1930) (wherein we stated on page 35 that \\\\u201cwe have never adopted the strictest rule of construction as to the form or contents of such notices under our unlawful detainer statutes, chiefly for the reason, doubtless, that the statutes prescribe no form.\\\\u201d). In the Provident Mutual case the notice was defective in three respects: (1) It contained the signature of the agent rather than the owner; (2) it overstated the amount of rent due by $165 as found by the trial court; and (3) it defectively described the premises. Although we did not specifically address the issue of the overstatement of the amount of rent due, we did hold the notice substantially complied with the requirements of Rem. Comp. Stat. \\\\u00a7 812 (now RCW 59.12.030).\\\\nIn the instant case, the 3-day notice to pay rent or vacate the premises that was served upon the defendant called for the payment of $205, the balance due under the lease, plus $75 per month for July and August. There was no dispute as to the monthly rental payment under the terms of the purported lease; however, there was a conflict as to the amount of the monthly rental due for the months of July and August. The plaintiff testified the rent for those months was to be $75 per month, and the defendant testified that it was to be $50 per month. It appears that the plaintiff\\\\u2019s demand for rental in the notice was in conformity with his good faith determination as to the amount of rental due, and that the defendant was not prejudiced as he could have tendered to the plaintiff the amount of rental due according to his understanding, of the agreement. See C. J. Peck, Landlord and Tenant Notices, 31 Wash. L. Rev. 51, 61 (1956). In tendering the amount due to the plaintiff, of course, he would deduct that amount due which he believed he was relieved from paying due to the landlord\\\\u2019s breach of his implied warranty of habitability.\\\\nWe believe that under the above facts, the plaintiff\\\\u2019s demand for rental was in substantial compliance with the statute and the fact that there was a dispute as to the amount of rent due, which was later determined contrary to the plaintiff, should not invalidate the unlawful detainer proceeding.\\\\nThe defendant also contends that the portion of RCW 59.12.170, which authorizes the doubling of damages, is unconstitutional as it is in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution.\\\\nWe need not reach this issue in light of the passage of the \\\\u201cResidential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973\\\\u201d (Laws of 1973, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 207), which eliminated the mandatory double damage provision from the law.\\\\nWhere substantial legislative or decisional changes in the applicable statutory provisions have been made, thereby precluding the imposition of the challenged provision, the constitutional issue need not be resolved. Grays Harbor Paper Co. v. Grays Harbor County, 74 Wn.2d 70, 442 P.2d 967 (1968); State School Directors Ass\\\\u2019n v. Department of Labor & Indus., 82 Wn.2d 367, 510 P.2d 818 (1973). See also State v. Vidal, 82 Wn.2d 74, 508 P.2d 158 (1973); State v. Baker, 81 Wn.2d 281, 501 P.2d 284 (1972).\\\\nAs we stated in Sorenson v. Bellingham, 80 Wn.2d 547, 558, 496 P.2d 512 (1972):\\\\nIt is a general rule that, where only moot questions or abstract propositions are involved, or where the substantial questions involved in the trial court no longer exist, the appeal, or writ of error, should be dismissed. There is an exception to the above stated proposition. The Supreme Court may, in its discretion, retain and decide an appeal which has otherwise become moot when it can be said that matters of continuing and substantial public interest are involved. . . . This exception to the general rule obtains only where the real merits of the controversy are unsettled and a continuing question of great public importance exists.\\\\n(Citations omitted.)\\\\nGiven the passage of the new landlord-tenant act and the absence of any actual trial court imposition of double damages in the instant case, the exception to the above rule is not in force and we therefore need not comment further upon this issue.\\\\nFor the guidance of the trial court at the new trial to which the defendant is entitled, the finder of fact must make two findings where the defendant claims the landlord has breached his implied warranty of habitability: (1) Whether the evidence indicates that the premises were totally or partially uninhabitable during the period of habitation and, if so, (2) what portion, if any or all, of the defendant\\\\u2019s obligation to pay rent is relieved by the landlord\\\\u2019s total or partial breach of his implied warranty of habitability. If the finder of fact determines that the entire rental obligation is extinguished by the landlord\\\\u2019s total breach, then the action for unlawful detainer based on nonpayment of rent must fail. If, on the other hand, the court determines that the premises are partially habitable, and the tenant failed to tender to the plaintiff a sufficient amount to pay rent due for the partially habitable premises, then judgment shall be entered in accordance with RCW 59.1^2.170.\\\\nThe judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial consistent with this opinion.\\\\nHale, C.J., and Rosellini, Hamilton, Stafford, and Utter, JJ., concur.\\\\nEvidence of one or two minor infractions of a housing code which do not affect habitability are inconsequential and would not entitle the tenant to a reduction in rent. Also, the tenant\\\\u2019s defense does not depend on official inspection or official finding of violations of a city housing code. Javins v. First Nat\\'l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925, 27 L. Ed. 2d 185, 91 S. Ct. 186 (1970); Diamond Housing Corp. v. Robinson, 257 A.2d 492 (D.C. Cir. 1969).\",\"type\":\"majority\",\"author\":\"Hunter, J.\"},{\"text\":\"Brachtenbach, J.\\\\n(dissenting) \\\\u2014 Ignoring the defendant\\\\u2019s own testimony, the majority casts this dispute into a traditional landlord-tenant battle and from that relationship creates an implied warranty of habitability. That creation might well be a desirable change in Washington law, but this simply is not the case in which it should be implemented.\\\\nThe majority\\\\u2019s application of such a warranty to the defects presented in this case and even its characterization of the defendant as a mere \\\\u201ctenant\\\\u201d are unsound in light of the defendant\\\\u2019s testimony, elicited by his own counsel:\\\\nQ. And what was the agreement between you and the Foiseys [sic] relating to the purchase of that house? A. The agreement was that I was to pay $50 a month to buy the house . . . Q. So, it was your understanding that the agreement was that you were to buy the house for $50 a month? A. That was my understanding . . . Q. At the time you moved in] were there defects on the premises? A. All kinds but I tried my best to bring them up to some remedy of standard . . . Q. What was your understanding as to what you had to do to exercise the option? A. My understanding was to clean the house up and fix it up to some degree. Q. So, in other words, you thought that\\\\u2014 A. Take care of it like a regular home owner. I figure it was mine and I was going to try to do the best I could but I run into all kinds of difficulty with the permit . . . Q. So, it was your understanding that you were purchasing the house and that is your only obligation to pay $50 a month? A. That was the whole understanding at the conception of the deal because her mother told me [objection], Q. So, the only time prior to March you were on the premises was to just look at it? A. Right. I told them I would buy and they said fine. They put me in it for $50 a month. Q. Had you done any work cleaning up the house or anything around the premises before you moved in on [sic] March? A. Oh, yes, I had to. Q. Before you moved in? A. Right, I had to. In the basement there was termites and there was things. Q. When were you doing those things? A. In February . . . Q. At that time did you have any agreement with the Foiseys [sic] as to whether or not you were going to purchase it? A. I had the agreement before I walked in that house. That\\\\u2019s when they told me you can have it for $50 a month. They wanted $87 a month. I said it isn\\\\u2019t worth it because it\\\\u2019s sitting still and the windows are out. \\'[Interruption.] Q. That understanding was that you were going to pay $50 per month? A. Correct. That is the only way I would walk in that house because I wasn\\\\u2019t in the proper position to bargain. They bargained to me because I saw a deal and I grabbed it . . . Q. As far as you were concerned, you never received any word that you were anything but a purchaser, is that right? A. To my knowledge, that was the only way I would have gone into that house as a purchaser. What would I want to rent it for I had a house of my own.\\\\nFrom that testimony it is perfectly clear that the defendant waS fully aware of the defects and deficiencies in the premises. Those defects and deficiencies were the very reason he was willing and able to negotiate lower payments.\\\\nIt requires no authority to sustain the proposition that a person who takes possession of premises with known defects, intends to repair those defects, bargains for reduced monthly payments and characterizes the transaction as a \\\\u201cdeal\\\\u201d which he \\\\u201cgrabbed,\\\\u201d neither deserves nor needs the protection of an implied warranty of habitability.\\\\nThe fact of the matter, apparent from the record, is that the defendant encountered difficulties with his continued, anticipated repairs when the housing code violations pending against the plaintiffs came to light. That situation might give rise to other remedies, but they are not asserted here.\\\\nBut apart from the foregoing, and even if the defendant is to be characterized as a tenant in the strict legal sense of that word, the majority fails to recognize that the Seattle housing code was not properly before the trial court.\\\\nIn his answer, affirmative defense and counterclaim, the defendant alleged violations of the provisions of the housing, building, fire, health and sanitation codes of the City of Seattle. Such shotgun pleading is a clear violation of CR 9 (i). At the time of trial, absolutely no proof of the housing code was provided, except to offer an unauthenticated, unidentified booklet entitled \\\\u201cHousing Code, City of Seattle.\\\\u201d The trial court, on that ground alone, correctly rejected testimony about violations of a city ordinance which had not been properly pleaded, properly authenticated or properly identified.\\\\nThe trial court should be affirmed.\\\\nWright, J., concurs with Brachtenbach, J.\",\"type\":\"dissent\",\"author\":\"Brachtenbach, J.\"},{\"text\":\"Ryan, J.\\\\n(concurring in the result of the dissent)\\\\u2014 However desirable the majority\\\\u2019s endorsement of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability may be, this is not a proper case for its application.\\\\nI would, therefore, concur in the result of the dissent.\\\\nPetition for rehearing denied December 12, 1973.\\\\nJustice Ryan is serving as a justice pro tempore of the Supreme Court pursuant to Const. art. 4, \\\\u00a7 2(a) (amendment 38).\",\"type\":\"concurrence\",\"author\":\"Ryan, J.\"}],\"attorneys\":[\"John Gant, for appellant.\",\"Thomas J.

The City of Renton, Respondent.\"],\"opinions\":[{\"text\":\"Millaed, J.\\\\n-This action was brought to enjoin the city of Renton from discharging waste water from its reservoir on to the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land. Plaintiff, being unable to sustain the same, voluntarily dismissed his second cause of action to recover for loss of fish and damage to his fish pond by such drainage. As an affirmative defense, the city alleged that it had acquired by prescription the right to flow water from its reservoir over the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land. The trial of the cause to the court resulted in judgment of dismissal. Plaintiff has appealed.\\\\nIn 1921, the appellant purchased, and has ever since owned and resided upon, three lots (comprising approximately two acres) lying to the south of the city of Renton and adjacent to the county road. A small, steady stream of pure water, fed from springs, runs through a gulch across this property from the southwest. In 1928, the appellant constructed upon this property, near the north boundary thereof, a concrete dam ninety feet long and eighteen feet high at the center. This created a pond covering approximately fifteen thousand square feet (a little more than one-sixth of the area of the two-acre tract of appellant), the water averaging ten to twelve feet in depth. The same year this dam was constructed, the appellant purchased twenty-five thousand small fish at a cost of one hundred and twenty-five dollars, and placed them in this pond. The appellant also maintained at this dam a wheel, which, except for the summer months, generated his electricity.\\\\nSince 1908, the city of Benton has maintained a reservoir as a part of its municipal water system. This reservoir is located adjacent to the said county road, and about twelve hundred feet to the south of appellant\\\\u2019s two acres. It is of concrete, and has a capacity of five hundred thousand gallons. A pipe line ten inches in diameter leads from the bottom of the reservoir and runs a distance of about.six hundred feet in an easterly direction, emptying into a natural depression or gulch, then empties into a small stream, which is the identical stream mentioned as flowing across the property of the appellant. This pipe line is used for draining the reservoir.\\\\nIt has been the practice since construction of the reservoir in 1908 to semi-annually discharge the water through the city service pipes until the water level in the reservoir is three or four feet from the bottom, when the remainder is drained through the ten-inch drainage or wash-out pipe, the amount of water so discharged through the drainage pipe being about forty thousand gallons. Because of the contamination by the presence of the bacillus coli in the city water, algae on the side walls of the reservoir, and sediment in the tank, the water is drained off as above mentioned, the sediment removed by men with buckets, and, after the flushing out of the tank through the drainage pipe, the inside of the tank is whitewashed. The silt or dirt, brushed down from the sides and in the bottom of the reservoir, is carried in buckets over the top of the reservoir and deposited on to the respondent city\\\\u2019s own property, and does not pass through the wash-out line. This process of draining occupies from two to two and one-half hours, the water so discharged reaching the property of appellant by gravity flow from the outlet of the drainage pipe.\\\\nThe testimony of respondent\\\\u2019s witnesses was to the effect that the water discharged from the reservoir through the wash-out line at no time reached to the top of the wall of appellant\\\\u2019s dam. Appellant testified that the sudden emptying of the water into the fish pond from the reservoir raised its level above the top of the dam, resulting in the fish being washed over the top of the dam and being killed. Appellant testified that his property was flooded three times: In May, 1928, a short time prior to placing the fish in the pond, and twice in September, 1929.\\\\n\\\\u201cQ. You want to say there were three times, once in May, 1928 \\\\u2014 A. On the 21st of May, 1928. Q. Yes. A. Just as soon as the wall was built and the dam was full of water, they washed the reservoir out. Q. And then again you say that the city flushed its reservoir in September? A. Yes, twice. Q. Twice? Tell the court those two dates in September, 1929, upon which you claim they flushed the reservoir? A. I can\\\\u2019t tell you. It was in September.\\\\u201d\\\\nBy letter of September 25,1928, the clerk of the city of Renton advised counsel for appellant that the city was making plans to fix this reservoir so that no water would come down into appellant\\\\u2019s fish pond; that the city was planning to divert the water to another location.\\\\nOn September 10, 1929, respondent\\\\u2019s water superintendent advised appellant by letter as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201c. . . The water department of the city of Ren-ton is about to connect its new supply main with its reservoir on Talbot Hill. In order to do this it will be necessary to completely empty said reservoir and the water that is released will pass through your pond and over the spillway of your dam. While the reservoir is empty we will also clean and repair it. We will not release the water in such quantity as will cause you any damage, but will let it out gradually. We will probably begin to empty on September 12th and it will remain empty for three or four days.\\\\n\\\\u201cWill you please cooperate with us to the extent that you lower your spillway gate to accommodate the excess water that will pass through?\\\\u201d\\\\nNo water was drained from the reservoir at that time, as a temporary injunction was issued on application of the appellant on September 11, 1929, restraining the respondent from discharging water from the reservoir. From that date until the injunction was dissolved on September 20,1929, no effort was made to drain the reservoir. As soon as the injunction was dissolved, the water was discharged from the reservoir. Appellant testified that, at the particular time in September when the water came from the reservoir into the creek and down into his pond, he did not raise the bolt which lowers the spillway of the dam; that the wire at his house by which he always did raise the spillway was in some manner defective, and that he could not go over to the pond to raise the bolt. He testified:\\\\n\\\\u201cYes, I tried to raise it from the house and I could not. I am lame and I could not, and I had to go over to the pond, to the wall before I could raise the holt. Q. If you could have raised it would that have prevented the overflow? A. From the house? Q. Yes. A. I suppose it would. Q. How is that operated, that holt, Mr. Downie? How do you raise it? A. With a wire. Q. And what was the reason you could not raise it at that time from the house? Is that the customary place you do that? A. No, only to get my lights. When I want to give the wheel water, then I pull the holt at the house, and up comes the light. . . . Q. And that particular day you didn\\\\u2019t succeed in doing that? A. No. Q. Why? A. The bolt was stuck. It hadn\\\\u2019t been used for a long time.\\\\u201d\\\\nAppellant contends that the discharge of contaminated water semi-annually from the respondent\\\\u2019s reservoir into the gulch, and thence into his fish pond, constitutes a violation of substantial rights in the use and enjoyment of property, entitling him to injunctive relief, though the resultant monetary damages suffered from such nuisance cannot be proved.\\\\nIn Mitchell Realty Co. v. City of West Allis, 184 Wis. 352, 199 N. W. 390, 35 A. L. R. 396, it was held that a municipal corporation is liable for injury to lower riparian owners for turning into a stream large quantities of water from its water works system and from artesian wells grossly charged with impurities, although it employs the natural course of drainage in so doing. Though the damages caused by flowing waters upon the lands of another be not considerable, equity will enjoin the continuance of such nuisance.\\\\n\\\\u201cThe corporation is liable ... if, without authority of law, it collects surface or other waters in a public sewer, and empties them upon the land of an individual to his injury, either immediately or by force of gravitation.\\\\u201d G-ould on Waters (3rd ed.), p. 530, \\\\u00a7261.\\\\n\\\\u201cIf any nuisance of this kind be shown, though causing inconsiderable damages, equity will enjoin its continuance . . . The inconvenience is one of the public\\\\u2019s own creation, and should be borne by it rather than the individual.\\\\u201d Id., p. 813, \\\\u00a7 546.\\\\nRespondent insists that, having carried on this practice for at least twenty years, a prescriptive right has been acquired by it to dispose of the water from the reservoir in the manner herein set forth.\\\\nA prescriptive right acquired by one is determinative of a corresponding loss or forfeiture of right by another, and, as forfeitures are not favored, it is absolutely essential that all of the elements necessary to constitute a permanent valid claim by adverse user, amounting to a prescriptive right should be shown to be present.\\\\n\\\\u201cThere are certain essential elements which enter into their composition, and which must be present before a right can be acquired by prescription. And as a prescriptive right, acquired by one person, is a corresponding loss or forefeiture of right by another, and, further, as the law does not favor forfeitures, it is absolutely essential that all the elements prescribed by law as necessary to constitute a permanent valid claim by adverse possession amounting to prescriptive right should be present.\\\\u201d 2 Kinney on Irrigation and Water Rights (2d ed.), p. 1876, \\\\u00a7 1048.\\\\nThat is to say, the respondent has no prescriptive easement, unless, for ten consecutive years, the drainage semi-annually of the reservoir and the resulting flowage of appellant\\\\u2019s land were so open, notorious, and adverse to the interests of the appellant (and his predecessors in interest) that he was bound to take notice of that invasion and object to the continuance thereof, or become bound by the servitude this imposed upon his land. To acquire an easement by prescription the owner must know of and acquiesce in the adverse claim, or the use must be so open, notorious, visible, and uninterrupted that knowledge and acquiescence will be presumed. 9 R. C. L. 779; 19 C. J. 881.\\\\nA right to flow water over another\\\\u2019s land may be acquired by prescription. Crumbaugh v. Mobile & O. R. Co., 105 Miss. 485, 62 South. 233.\\\\n\\\\u201cDrainage rights may be acquired by prescription. The character of the usage of an easement which will ripen into a legal right by prescription is the same as is required to gain title to land by adverse possession. . . . The claim of right must be exercised with the knowledge of the owner of the servient estate, i. e., actual knowledge or a user on the part of the claimant of such character that knowledge will be presumed.\\\\u201d Naporra v. Weckwerth, 178 Minn. 203, 226 N. W. 569.\\\\nThe case at bar is not one within the rule of claim of right by adverse possession to uncultivated, unoccupied, and wild lands. Murray v. Bousquet, 154 Wash. 42, 280 Pac. 935. The land through which the water from the reservoir flows is close to and in view of the county road. One of appellant\\\\u2019s neighbors testified that he uses part of this water which is carried across his land for his barn, and he has lived there since 1913. The area of appellant\\\\u2019s three lots is approximately two acres or eighty-seven thousand square feet. More than one-sixth of that area has been converted into a fish pond. His neighbor knew as early as 1913, and others testified they knew as far back as 1909, that the reservoir was drained semi-annually and the water discharged into the gulch, thence into the stream flowing across appellant\\\\u2019s land.\\\\nThat the use was open and notorious is clear. Appellant has resided on the two acres since 1921. He did not complain until 1928 of the use of the gulch and creek by the respondent for drainage of its reservoir. Surely, on such a small tract of land, on which he resided for seven years, the appellant, could not fail to see, the presumption is conclusive that he did see, the water flowing through the gulch fourteen to sixteen times during that period.\\\\nWe do not agree with appellant that the semi-annual discharge of the water into the gulch was not such open, notorious, and continuous use as the law requires must be done in order to serve as a basis for an adverse claim of right. We are convinced that appellant had actual knowledge sometime subsequent to 1921, and prior to the construction of his dam in 1928, of respondent\\\\u2019s use of the ditch. If such discharge of the water into that ditch resulted as appellant contends, of depositing a substantial amount of silt and dirt, the accumulation from 1908 to 1921, plus the added deposit subsequent to 1921, the gradual filling in of the gulch, apprised appellant of the use by respondent.\\\\nThe first complaint made of the water flowing over his land was made by the appellant to the respondent in August, 1928. Appellant testified that the city wrote and informed his counsel they would not route any more water over the pond; that no more water was thrown upon his land until the date he got the restraining order. It is clear from the testimony, however, that the appellant is mistaken. Doubtless the appellant is somewhat confused as to his dates. It is clear from the record that in September, 1929, when, appellant was advised that the reservoir would be cleaned, and request was made that he lower the spillway of his dam, an order was issued, on application of the appellant, restraining the city from discharging the water into the gulch; that no water was discharged from the reservoir into the gulch until the temporary restraining order was dissolved September 20, 1929.\\\\n- The use by respondent of the ditch was such as afforded reasonable indication of the claim. To constitute a prescriptive right to use of the ditch for flow-age of waste water from the reservoir, the acts of respondent must have been of such a nature and frequency as to give notice to appellant that the right was being claimed.\\\\n\\\\u201cIt has been said that the correct rule, as to continuity of use to give a prescriptive right to an easement and what shall constitute such continuity, can be stated only with reference to the nature and character of the right claimed. However, in order that user may be considered continuous, it is not necessary that it should be constant. Ordinarily, if whenever the claimant needs it from time to time he makes use of it, and the acts constituting the user are of such frequency as to give notice to the landowner of the rights claimed against him, the nser will be considered continuous. And a fortiori a temporary nonuser by agreement of the parties is not fatal. Nevertheless there must be such repeated acts of such character and at such intervals as afford a sufficient indication to the owner that an easement is claimed; . . . \\\\u201d 19 C. J. 882.\\\\nSee, also,\\\\n\\\\u201cBy exclusive, the law does not mean that the right of way must be used by one person only, because two or more persons may be entitled to the use of the same way, but simply that the right should not depend for its enjoyment upon a similar right in others, and that the party claiming it exercises it under some claim existing in his favor independent of all others. It must be exclusive as against the right of the community at large.\\\\n\\\\u201cNor does the law mean by \\\\u2018an uninterrupted and continuous enjoyment,\\\\u2019 that a person shall use the way every day for twenty years, but simply that he exercises the right more or less frequently, according to the nature of the use to which its enjoyment may be applied, and without objection on the part of the owner of the land, and under such circumstances as excludes the presumption of a voluntary abandonment on the part of the person claiming it.\\\\u201d Cox v. Forrest, 60 Md. 74.\\\\n\\\\u201cThe claimant is required to make such reasonable use of the way as his needs require. So it is of the ditch. If, whenever the claimant needs it, from time to time, he makes use of it, this is a continuous use. An omission to use when not needed does not disprove a continuity of use, shown by using it when needed (Bodfish v. Bodfish, 105 Mass. 317). Neither such intermission nor omission breaks the continuity.\\\\u201d Hesperia Land & Water Co. v. Rogers, 83 Cal. 10, 23 Pac. 196.\\\\nPrior to September, 1929, there was no affirmative act on the part of appellant contesting the right of respondent to use the ditch for the drainage of its reservoir. Prior to appellant\\\\u2019s moving upon the property in 1921, the prescriptive right of respondent to so use the ditch had been acquired. (Por more than ten years prior to 1921, the ditch was continuously used by respondent.)\\\\nA letter from the city clerk in the year 1928, advising counsel for appellant of the city\\\\u2019s plan to divert the water to another location, and the letter of respondent of September, 1929, requesting cooperation on the part of appellant to prevent the flooding of his pond, are not such acts on the part of respondent as will defeat its prescriptive right. The respondent\\\\u2019s title had vested prior to that time; therefore, conceding respondent requested permission in 1929 to flow the land, such act would not have defeated the prescriptive right of the respondent. The rule is stated as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is elementary that where the title has become fully vested by disseizin so long continued as to bar an action, it can not be divested by parol abandonment or relinquishment or by verbal declarations of the disseizor, nor by any other act short of what would be required in a case where his title was by deed. School District v. Benson, 31 Me. 381. We therefore conclude that from any point of view, whether a lease was made or not is not a material matter.\\\\u201d Towles v. Hamilton, 94 Neb. 588, 143 N. W. 935.\\\\n\\\\u201cThe presumption of a grant is rebutted if the person prescribing for the easement acknowledges the right of the owner within twenty years, though he does it under a mistake of his own rights. So the asking leave to exercise the right from time to time within the period of prescription breaks the continuity of the enjoyment as of right, inasmuch as each asking of leave is an admission that, at that time, the person so asking had no title; but the right, when fully established by adverse use, is not lost by asking and receiving a license from the original owner, although this may, in case of doubt, be strong evidence that the previous user was not under a claim of right.\\\\u201d Gould on Waters (3d ed.), p. 641, \\\\u00a7339.\\\\n\\\\u201cWhere title has become perfect by adverse possession for the statutory period it is not lost by an admission of the holder that the possession was not adverse, . . .\\\\u201d 2 C. J. 256.\\\\nSee, also, McInnis v. Day Lumber Co., 102 Wash. 38, 172 Pac. 844.\\\\nThe appellant had actual knowledge shortly subsequent to 1921 of the use by respondent of the ditch, and did nothing to prevent respondent from its continuous enjoyment of the right claimed by it. The use by the respondent of that ditch has been open, notorious, continuous, uninterrupted, and adverse to the appellant and his predecessors in interest since 1908.\\\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\\\nMitchell, Holcomb, and Fullerton, JJ., \\\\u201cconcur.\\\\nBeals, J., dissents.\",\"type\":\"majority\",\"author\":\"Millaed, J.\"}],\"attorneys\":[\"Shorett, Shorett & Taylor, for appellant.\",\"Agnes N.

The trial court properly found that, with plaintiffs\\\\u2019 consent, the lease was assigned by the Shubert Theater Company to the defendant American Building Company, a corporation. The leased rooms had a frontage of forty-five and one-half feet on Post street, and extended easterly to the west line of the theater building. The lessee was authorized to construct, at its own expense, a theater entrance of such width as it desired. For such purpose, it was permitted to change or move a partition between the two storerooms and construct other partitions on either side of the entrance. It was also authorized to use and occupy, for any lawful purpose, that portion of the leased area not used for the theater entrance. Other provisions of the lease will be hereinafter mentioned. The American Building Company constructed a theater entrance eleven feet in width, separated by partitions from storerooms located\\' on either side thereof within the leased . area. When these rooms were ready for occupancy, the American Building Company as lessee sublet the south rpom to the defendant Edmund Dufresne, who intended to use the same for a cigar store,and saloon. To make connections with the city water mains and sewer, Dufresne cut a few holes through the storeroom floor. Thereupon this action was commenced by plaintiffs, the original lessors, to enjoin the lessee from subletting to Dufresne, to enjoin him from cutting through the floors, or connecting with the city water mains and sewer, and to recover damages .for changes already made. A restraining order was granted which, after a hearing upon the merits, was made permanent by the final decree. Plaintiffs were also awarded judgment for $10 damages and their costs. \\' The defendants have appealed.\\\\nRespondents\\\\u2019 principal contention is that the lessee had no power of authority to sublet the south room to Dufresne without their written consent, which was not granted. The clause upon which this contention is predicated reads as follows :\\\\n\\\\u201cThe said party of the second part [the lessee] further covenants and agrees not to assign this lease nor to permit any other persons to improve the same or make or suffer any alterations therein except as herein stated, unless the written permission of the said parties of the first part shall have first been obtained in writing.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis is a covenant that the lease itself shall not be assigned, no reference to a subletting being made. The lease also provided that:\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is further expressly understood and agreed that the said premises hereby demised are to be used by the said lessee, its successors and assigns, for a theater entrance to the theater in the rear of said premises, and that so much of said premises as may not be necessary or devoted to a theater entrance hereinafter referred to may be used by said party of the second part for any lawful purpose.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis stipulation seems to contemplate a subletting for any lawful purpose, of that portion of the leasehold not converted into a theater entrance. The authorities are numerous to the effect that stipulations against an assignment of a lease, or against a subletting, are to be strictly construed. Discussing covenants not to assign or underlet, Taylor, in the ninth edition of his work on Landlord and Tenant, at \\\\u00a7 403, says:\\\\n\\\\u201cCovenants of this description are construed by courts of law with the utmost strictness, to prevent the restraint from going beyond the express stipulation. If, therefore, the lessee covenants \\\\u2018not to assign, transfer, set over,\\\\u2019 or otherwise do, or put away the lease or premises, this does not prevent him from underletting. Nor will a covenant \\\\u2018not to let or underlet the whole or any part\\\\u2019 of the demised premises preclude an assignment of the whole interest.\\\\u201d\\\\nTiffany, in his work on Landlord and Tenant, at pages 921-2, says:\\\\n\\\\u201cRestrictions of this character, upon alienation by the lessee, are not favored and are, it is said, to be construed strictly, and a particular mode of alienation is, it has been stated in a leading case on the subj ect, not to be regarded as prohibited unless it is \\\\u2018by words which admit of no other meaning.\\\\u2019 Accordingly, a covenant or condition not to assign is not broken by the making of a sublease, and, in spite of a dictum to the contrary, the weight both of reason and authority is to the effect that a covenant not to sublet is not broken by an assignment.\\\\u201d\\\\nA marked and well-recognized distinction exists between a covenant against an assignment of the entire lease, and a covenant against the subletting of a portion of the premises. An expressed covenant against the one privilege will not restrain the lessee from enjoying or exercising the other. Taking into consideration the two clauses above quoted, we conclude the lessee was entitled to sublet the south storeroom without the lessors\\\\u2019 consent. Spencer v. Commercial Co., 30 Wash. 520, 71 Pac. 53; Cuschner v. Westlake, 43 Wash. 690, 86 Pac. 148.\\\\nThe lease, however, in express terms provides that :\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is expressly understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that the only portion of said building included in this lease is the first floor thereof as herein described so far as the same is embraced and included in the rooms known as No. 226 and 228, Post street, and extending east and west through said building, and\\\\u2019 that this lease does not include the basement below said first floor or any part of said building adj oining or above the part so rented.\\\\u201d\\\\nIt was alleged by respondents and shown by the evidence, that the. appellant Dufresne, as sublessee, was installing water and sewer connections, and that in so doing he had bored a few holes through the floor of the south storeroom so that he might pass connecting pipes through the basement to the city mains. It is not contended, nor was it shown, that he could make the connections in any other manner. The lease authorized the lessee to make such changes within the area leased as might be necessary to construct the theater entrance, and in so doing to make changes in partitions on the first floor. It also provided:\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is further understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that the said party of the second part [the lessee] shall at its own expense furnish all the light, heat and water which it may use upon the premises hereby demised, and the said party of the second part hereby promises, covenants and agrees that in the installation of said light, heat and water such piping and wiring, or other work as may be necessary for such installation shall not interfere in any way with the balance of said building of the said parties of the first part, and not included in this lease, or with any other tenants in the said building.\\\\u201d\\\\nRespondents contend that this stipulation prohibited the lessee from passing pipes through the basement to the water mains and sewer. There appears to have been no other way in which to make the connections and obtain the service. The basement was unoccupied, and it was shown that the proposed connections would not interfere with any reasonable use to which it could be devoted. The lease expressly provides that the lessee shall obtain such service at its own expense. If connections are not to be made through the basement, they could not be made at all, and the lease would be inconsistent, as by one stipulation it would deprive the lessee of the enjoyment of rights expressly granted by another. It is a well-recognized principle in the law of landlord and tenant, that the lease of a portion of a building carries with it as incidental, thereto everything necessary to the reasonable use and enjoyment of the lease, and we are constrained to hold that the lessee did have the right to make reasonable water and sewer connections through the basement, that being the only manner in which they could be made.\\\\nRespondents, citing Rem. & Bal. Code, \\\\u00a7 6290, insist that Dufresne could not lawfully conduct a saloon business in the south storeroom without first obtaining a license; that no such license could be obtained without respondents\\\\u2019 written consent as owners, and that respondents are therefore entitled to an injunction to prevent the subletting. Respondents could have inserted a stipulation in the lease, prohibiting any saloon on the premises, but did not do so. If, as they contend, they can now prevent that business by refusing their written consent to the issuance of a license, they are at liberty to do so, and it is not necessary for them to come into a court of equity and enj oin a subletting to the appellant Dufresne. He intends to conduct a cigar store as well as a saloon. If the latter cannot be permitted, for want of a license, he would nevertheless be entitled to his sublease, so that at his election he might use the storeroom for the cigar business alone, or any other lawful business. Respondents contend that he cannot conduct a saloon without their written consent to a license. Conceding this to be true, he could conduct any other lawful business under his sublease without their consent. We find no equities in this case entitling respondents to an injunction, nor do we think they are entitled to damages for necessary work done in preparing to make connections with the water mains and sewer.\\\\nThe judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded with instructions to dismiss the action.\\\\nDunbar, C.

      "Based on the provided cases, here are the top 3 legal principles relevant to the issue of water leaking into an apartment from the floor above in Washington:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Landlord's Duty to Repair and Maintain Safe Conditions**:\n",
      "   - **Principle**: A landlord has a duty to maintain the premises in a condition of reasonable safety, especially when the premises remain under their control. If a landlord negligently fails to repair or maintain the premises, resulting in damage to a tenant, the landlord can be held liable.\n",
      "   - **Prominent Cases**:\n",
      "     - **Mabel Le Vette v. Hardman Estate**: The Washington Supreme Court held that the landlord was negligent in failing to control and keep the upper stories in a condition of reasonable safety, leading to water damage in the tenant's storeroom below.\n",
      "     - **Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co.**: The court found that the landlord had a duty to inform the tenant of the means to prevent freezing and bursting of water pipes, and failure to do so resulted in liability for water damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Implied Warranty of Habitability**:\n",
      "   - **Principle**: In Washington, there is an implied warranty of habitability in residential leases, meaning that landlords must provide and maintain premises that are safe and habitable. Breach of this warranty can constitute a defense in an unlawful detainer action and can relieve the tenant from the obligation to pay rent.\n",
      "   - **Prominent Cases**:\n",
      "     - **Foisy v. Wyman**: The Washington Supreme Court recognized an implied warranty of habitability, holding that tenants should be provided with a livable dwelling, and breach of this warranty can be a defense in an unlawful detainer action.\n",
      "     - **Frisken v. Art Strand Floor Coverings, Inc.**: The court held that a seller (or landlord) impliedly warrants that the premises are fit for the intended use, and failure to meet this standard can result in liability for damages.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Negligence and Liability for Water Damage**:\n",
      "   - **Principle**: A landlord can be held liable for water damage caused by negligence in maintaining plumbing or other facilities. This includes failing to address known defects or failing to take reasonable precautions to prevent foreseeable damage.\n",
      "   - **Prominent Cases**:\n",
      "     - **DeHoney v. Gjarde**: The court held that a contractor (or by extension, a landlord) is liable for damages resulting from negligent construction or maintenance that causes water damage.\n",
      "     - **Woolworth Co. v. City of Seattle**: The court found that the city (analogous to a landlord) was liable for damages caused by inadequate sewer capacity, emphasizing the responsibility to maintain systems that prevent water damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "These principles highlight the landlord's responsibilities in maintaining safe and habitable living conditions and the potential legal consequences of failing to do so.\n"

White & Bollard, Inc., Respondent.\"],\"opinions\":[{\"text\":\"Geraghty, J.\\\\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of dismissal entered after the court had sustained a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence and discharged the jury, at the close of appellant\\\\u2019s case.\\\\nThe appellant, with his mother, occupied an apartment in a building owned by the respondent, under a written lease, which required the tenant\\\\n\\\\u201c . . . to make, at his own cost and expense, all repairs and betterments necessary to be made upon the said premises during the full period of tenancy.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe appellant sustained an injury to his hand through the breaking of the porcelain handle of a hot water faucet in the kitchen sink, which he was turning off at the time of the injury. Appellant testified that the faucet was leaking and his mother had complained to Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey, who looked after the janitor work and were in charge of the building for the owners. Mr. Ramsey came to the apartment, went into the kitchen, and appellant asked him, \\\\u201cHow does it come we are having so much trouble with this hot water faucet, it is leaking again?\\\\u201d, and further, \\\\u201cYou had better take a look at that handle. It seems to me like it is cracked. You had better fix it.\\\\u201d Mr. Ramsey said, \\\\u201cAll right.\\\\u201d\\\\nAppellant was not present when the repair was made, and, being out of his apartment much of the intervening two or three days between the repair and the time of injury, paid no special attention to the faucet. At the time of injury, he was in the kitchen with his mother. She asked him to turn off the faucet as it was leaking again. He testified:\\\\n\\\\u201cI went np to turn off the hot water faucet, and the hot water faucet is on the left hand side as I approached the kitchen sink. I got ahold of the hot water faucet with my left hand, and turned it to the left, which is the proper way to turn that particular faucet, and as I turned it to the left all of a sudden the faucet snapped and the next thing I knew why I pulled my hand away from the faucet and took a look at the palm of my hand, and here was a large piece of the china or porcelain handle imbedded in the palm of my hand. . . . when the faucet broke away I kind of lunged forward, because I had my weight against the faucet, and I went forward, but I didn\\\\u2019t lose my balance. I was on my feet, but I was pressing against the faucet, and when it snapped, my weight against the handle brought me forward, and I kind of lunged forward. \\\\u2019 \\\\u2019\\\\nAfter the accident, he asked Mr. Eamsey what he had done to the faucet that it should leak so shortly after being fixed. Eamsey answered:\\\\n\\\\u201c \\\\u2018Well, I took it apart and I didn\\\\u2019t have any new washer, rubber washer, or gaskets,\\\\u2019 I think he said, or washers, I don\\\\u2019t remember what word he used, and so he said \\\\u2018I took an old one and turned it upside down, and I figured that would do, because it has worked before.\\\\u2019 \\\\u201d\\\\nThe trial court sustained the challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence upon the ground that the respondent was under no duty to repair the faucet, and that, if any liability attached by reason of its gratuitous assumption of the repair, there was no causal connection between the repair of the washer to stop the leak and the breaking of the handle. The court was also of the view that, whatever the defect in the handle, it was as obvious to appellant as to respondent.\\\\nWhile, under the terms of the lease, the landlord was under no duty to make repairs and would not be liable for a breach of its promise to repair, made subsequent to the execution of the lease and without consideration, there is authority for the rule that, even though a gratuitous executory contract would not be binding on a landlord, he would place himself in a different position if he should see fit to treat it as binding and actually enter upon its performance; that, while he is at liberty to repudiate the contract or to perform it at his option, if he chooses to perform he becomes under some measure of liability as to the manner of performance. 16 R. C. L. 1033. If respondent is liable at all, in the present case, it can be only under this view of the law, \\\\u2014 that, having undertaken to repair the faucet, the respondent performed the work in such a negligent manner that injury resulted therefrom to the appellant.\\\\nThe principal repair requested by the appellant was the correction of the leaky condition of the water faucet. Eamsey\\\\u2019s attention was also called to the condition of the porcelain handle, which appellant said was cracked. Conceding, as claimed by appellant, that Eamsey promised to replace the handle, he did not do so, and appellant was in no way misled by his failure. Assuming that the repair of the washer within the faucet was improperly done by Eamsey, there was no causal connection between this fact and the breaking of the handle. Furthermore, as the leaky condition of the faucet continued, it was apparent to the appellant, as well as to respondent\\\\u2019s manager, that the condition was unchanged.\\\\nExpressed in a few words, the relation of the parties was this: The appellant himself had agreed to make all the repairs. He asked Eamsey, the landlord\\\\u2019s manager of the building, to make a repair for him that he himself was under a duty to make. Eamsey undertook to make the repair, but failed to do it in a satisfactory manner. His failure was known to the appellant because the handle was unchanged, and the faucet continued to leak. The condition of the faucet was made no worse by Bamsey\\\\u2019s gratuitous repair of it, or his failure to replace the handle.\\\\nWe are of the opinion that the trial court correctly dismissed the action, and the judgment will be affirmed.\\\\nMillard, C.

Wood, Appellant, v. The City of Tacoma, Respondent.\"],\"opinions\":[{\"text\":\"Ellis, J.\\\\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of non-suit and dismissal of an action to recover damages consequent upon the grading of, and construction of storm sewers in, certain streets in the city of Tacoma.\\\\nAbout three years before any of the streets in the vicinity of her property had been graded, the appellant bought lots 5 to 10, inclusive, in block 4, of Elsmere addition to Tacoma. Block 4 fronts to the south on 60th street, and is bounded on the east by J street, on the west by K street, and on the north by the alley between blocks 3 and 4. We reproduce a plat from respondent\\\\u2019s brief the correctness of which seems not to be questioned, merely for the purpose of illustration and to show the location of streets in relation to the appellant\\\\u2019s lots. See nest page.\\\\nElsmere addition is in an outlying part of the city. Some houses had been built there and in that neighborhood, apparently before any of the streets were graded or any drainage provided. The general slope of the land iif that vicinity is from the south and east to the north and west. Appellant\\\\u2019s lots occupy low ground, across which originally the natural drainage of the country to the south and east for a considerable distance flowed. Originally this surface water ran off of appellant\\\\u2019s lots and across block 3 to the northwest. At the time when the city began the grading here in question, improvements and filling by the owners of block 3 had obstructed the natural course of the water, so that it ran in a small ditch \\\\u2014 it does not appear by whom dug\\\\u2014 along the alley to K street, and thence north. There was also a ditch on the southerly side of 60th street which carried a part of the surface water to K street. This was apparently dug after the appellant had purchased and built on her lots; and, also, after that time, the city dug a ditch northward along K street to carry all this surface water to a large drain on 58th street. It appears that these ditches, and also other ditches and drains on this sloping territory, the location and character of which are not made clear by\\\\nthe evidence, had been made, some of them by the city, and others by the owners of different properties. It seems to be admitted that no permanent system of drainage had been constructed or adopted by the city in this territory when appellant purchased her lots and built her house, nor up to the time of the grading complained of in this action. Up to that time, the drainage, such as it was, was merely temporary in character and construction and adapted to the natural surface of the ground.\\\\nIn the fall of 1909, the city, by contract, began the grading of the streets and alleys in the vicinity of appellant\\\\u2019s property. The work apparently included all of these streets, excepting south 60th street. This grading was the initial improvement of these streets, the first change from the natural contour of the ground. Just before the heavy rains of November, the grading of K street had been completed; and between 60th and 59th streets, it had been necessary to raise the level of the street and sidewalks a little above the natural surface. At the same time, and as a part of the same work, the alley between blocks 3 and 4 was correspondingly raised. There was, therefore, a fill, variously estimated at from a foot to two feet, in the alley in the rear of appellant\\\\u2019s lots. This grading of the street and alley filled the ditch\\'in the alley and stopped up the K street end of the ditch on 60th street. At the same time, the city was constructing a storm sewer, from 64th street north along J street to 60th street, and along 60th to K street. \\' The heavy rains stopped the work before it reached K street. It does not appear that this sewer was fully completed from 64th street down to 60th street, but it does appear that the pipes were laid at 60th and J street, and that there was a manhole at 61st street and another at 60th street.\\\\nIn the grading of 61st street, there was a slight cut between K and- J streets, and the surplus dirt-was used in filling the lots in the vacant block 6, abutting on the north side of 61st street. This whole block was filled to about 18 inches above the street. When the heavy rains of November came, the water, following its usual course from the higher ground from the south and east, being arrested by this filling of block 6, collected in 61st street and vicinity forming a pond. A part of the filling on the lots near J street washed away, and some of the water which had collected in 61st street flowed into the unfinished storm sewer, and out again through the manhole at 60th and J street, thence down 60th street onto appellant\\\\u2019s lots, and was there retained by the filled grade of K street and of the alley in the rear of her lots, causing the injury complained of.\\\\nIt is fairly deducible from the whole of the evidence that little if-any\\'more water was thus collected upon appellant\\\\u2019s lots than would have been the case had no water been allowed to collect in 61st street and had no storm sewer been constructed in J street. The water which came from 61st street would simply have collected in the first instance in 60th street and upon the appellant\\\\u2019s lots. It was merely delayed in its progress by the filling in of block 6, and reached appellant\\\\u2019s lots possibly a little later than otherwise by going around the block instead of crossing it diagonally. But even if there was an increase in the amount of water, it has been held not to create a liability unless the water be cast in a concentrated and destructive body upon the land. Davis v. Crawfordsville, 119 Ind. 1, 21 N. E. 449, 12 Am. St. 361; Jordan v. Benwood, 42 West Va. 312, 26 S. E. 266, 57 Am. St. 859, 36 L. R. A. 519; Hume v. Des Moines, 146 Iowa 624, 29 L. R. A. (N. S.) 126; Miller v. Morristown, 47 N. J. Eq. 62, 20 Atl. 61.\\\\nThe real cause of the water collecting upon appellant\\\\u2019s lots was the raising of the grade of K street and the alley back of these lots, which stopped the drains in 60th street and the alley, thus impounding the water. The evidence fairly indicates that, but for this grading, the water would have passed off as formerly. The appellant herself makes this plain. With reference to the old drains in the alley in 60th street and K street, she testified:\\\\n\\\\u201cQ. This is 60th street, as I understand you; what do you call this (referring to Identification A). There was a drain which you say the city made some time down there, and opened it down there in 60th street? A. Yes. Q. Was the ditch in K street at that time the same kind of a drain? A. No, it was a box. Q. Was it open on K, on this side? A. No they covered it up. Q. How far does it run? A. Run down as I understood down to 58th; they had a big ditch down 58th. Q. If it was not for putting that drain in there by somebody by Mr. Wright or somebody, all of this water would have come across your place? A. Yes. Q. So far as that is concerned, that relieved you some? A. Yes, after they graded the street last winter, they put the dirt in here (indicating on Exhibit). Q. That is what you complain of? A. Yes, I complain of them stopping the ditches and the natural drain. Q. Is it not a fact that the natural drain went down across the lots further? A. No, it went through the alley, not through Hadland\\\\u2019s lots at all.\\\\u201d\\\\nIt is now established law in this state that damages cannot be recovered for consequential injuries to private property occasioned by the original grading of streets and alleys. The dedication of streets and alleys to the public use implies an agreement of the dedicator and his successors in interest that the city may establish grades and improve the streets and alleys thereto in aid of such use. Ettor v. Tacoma, 57 Wash. 50, 106 Pac. 478, 107 Pac. 1061; Fletcher v. Seattle, 43 Wash. 627, 86 Pac. 1046, 88 Pac. 843; Laws 1909, p. 151, \\\\u00a7 1 (Rem. & Bal. Code, \\\\u00a7 7815) ; 4 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (5th ed.), \\\\u00a7 1684.\\\\nIt is also the settled doctrine in this state that surface water caused by the falling of rain or the melting of snow, is to be regarded as an outlaw or common enemy against which every proprietor of land may defend himself, even if in consequence of such defense injury result to others. As to surface waters, this court has definitely adopted the rule of the common law, as - distinguished from the contrary rule of the civil law. Cass v. Dicks, 14 Wash. 75, 44 Pac. 113, 53 Am. St. 859; Harvey v. Northern Pac. R. Co., 63 Wash. 669, 116 Pac. 464; Gould, Waters (3d ed.), \\\\u00a7 265; 30 Am. & Eng. Ency. Law (2d ed.), p. 330.\\\\n\\' Erom the adoption by this court without qualification or restriction of these two doctrines, namely, that a municipal corporation is not liable for injuries consequent upon the initial grading and improvement of its streets, and that surface water is a common enemy against which any one may defend himself, arises the corollary that a city is not liable in damages for injuries to private property by the collection of surface water thereon, caused by the initial grading or improvement of its streets and alleys. Injuries resulting from the reasonable exercise of a legal power are consequential, and cannot be made the basis of recovery. Such is the rule in all those jurisdictions which have adopted without modification the common-enemy doctrine of the common law.\\\\n\\\\u201cIn the jurisdictions which adopt the common law rule, it is held that the rule applies fully to municipal or quasi-municipal corporations as to individuals, and that such a corporation does not incur any liability if in the improvement of its streets or highways it prevents the flow of surface water from adjacent lots; and the same has been held true with regard to the improvement of city lots owned by a municipality. On the other hand, it has been held that a landowner may, by erections or obstructions on his own lands, prevent the flowage of surface waters from a highway upon his land.\\\\u201d 30 Am. & Eng. Ency. Law (2d ed.), pp. 331-332.\\\\nSee, also, 4 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (5th ed), \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 1732, 1733; Elliott, Roads & Streets (3d ed.), \\\\u00a7 556; Gould, Waters (3d ed.), \\\\u00a7 269.\\\\nThere is an exception to this rule of nonliability, which, though not indorsed by some of the courts, and which we do not find has often been applied to the initial grading of streets, we nevertheless believe to be sound in any case. A\\' city may not gather np surface water and discharge it upon land in a concentrated volume to the injury of the land without liability, whether the water be such as naturally would have flowed onto the land or not. The reason is that when collected and discharged in considerable volume upon the land at a given point it may erode and wash channels in the land thus becoming very destructive and injurious. Johnson v. White, 26 R. I. 207, 58 Atl. 658, 65 L. R. A. 250, and note to p. 262. The appellant contends that the evidence bi\\\\u2019ings this case within the exception. But we think not. It fails to show that the water was discharged upon the appellant\\\\u2019s lots in a concentrated volume. It escaped from the manhole in the street, and flowed upon the appellant\\\\u2019s land in a diffused form, as it would have done in any event. In such a case, the mere fact that the water was concentrated in its course to appellant\\\\u2019s land does not create a liability which would not otherwise exist. Clay v. St. Albans, 43 West Va. 539, 27 S. E. 368, 64 Am. St. 883.\\\\nThere remains to be considered the question of negligence. It must be conceded that a municipal corporation, like an individual, is liable for injuries resulting from the negligent exercise of legitimate powers. There is no evidence whatever that, on the completion of the storm sewer on J and 60th street and the new drain on K street, they did not furnish adequate drainage for this district, including appellant\\\\u2019s property; nor was there any evidence that, if the improvement had been completed before the rainy season, any injury would have occurred. The evidence does not make a case of improper or negligent final construction, but merely shows a failure to provide adequate temporary drainage during the progress of the work and the delay made necessary by the rainy season. There is no negligence where there is no violation of duty. There was no absolute duty on the part of the city to furnish temporary drainage for appellant\\\\u2019s lots pending the grading and placing of drains in K street and the construction of the storm sewer on J and 60th streets; nor was it bound to do this if it would entail expense or cause any considerable interference with the prosecution of the work of grading the streets after it had been undertaken, or if it was incompatible with the plan of improvement adopted by the city. Nor was the city bound to do this at all, if the appellant had sufficient notice of the contemplated improvement of the streets, and the manner in which the work was to be done, to have enabled her to protect her lots by providing drainage herself, or by filling the lots, as the evidence shows she has since done. The fact that the old temporary ditches had been dug in the ungraded alley and in the ungraded 60th street, either by the city or with its permission, can make no difference. The city did not thereby abdicate its right to establish an initial grade for its streets and fill them to that grade even if in so doing it filled these ditches. Any other view would make the city liable to some one for some inconvenience every time it sought to grade a street for the first time, and thus render the statute nugatory. The rule in such a case which appeals to us as reasonable, and especially as in. consonance with our statute which does not permit recovery for damages for injuries resulting from the reasonable exercise of the power to grade streets for the first time (Rem. & Bal. Code, \\\\u00a7 7815) is declared by the supreme court of Iowa, in a case cited by appellant, as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cThe true rule here, as we understand it, is that, as the city had power to grade and gutter its streets, it is not liable for defective plans, for in adopting them it acts in a judicial capacity. But it is liable if it negligently carries out such plans, or if, without the adoption of any plans, it proceeds in a negligent manner to make embankments or fills, to the injury of an abutting or adjoining proprietor. As applied to the facts of the case, the city was not liable because of its establishment of grades for West Walnut and West Sixteenth streets, because its act in so doing was either legislative or judicial in character; but in bringing the streets to these grades established, it was bound to the exercise of ordinary care and prudence, and if it unnecessarily or negligently filled ditches and drains in West Sixteenth street, and thus cast surface water back upon plaintiff\\\\u2019s lots, without notice to her, and without her knowledge, and without giving her a reasonable time to bring her lots to grade, the city is liable, not because of defective plans, but by reason of negligence in doing a purely ministerial act; that is, of bringing the streets to the established grade, and, in so doing, filling the ditches and drains for the escape of surface water without providing an escape, either temporary or permanent, for the surface water. Moreover, there was evidence tending to show that it so filled the streets as to collect surface water and discharge it upon plaintiff\\\\u2019s lot. As plaintiff had the right to fill her lot by bringing it to the established grade, doubtless defendant was not obliged to provide permanent culverts, drains, or bridges, although that point we do not now decide. If, after her property is brought to grade, such culverts, ditches, or drains should be constructed, a question may then arise as to defendant\\\\u2019s duty in the premises.\\\\u201d Hume v. Des Moines, supra, 29 L. R. A. (N. S.) 127-136.\\\\nThe evidence shows that the appellant had notice of the city\\\\u2019s intention before the old ditches were filled. She says she protested to the city officials, and in fact that she brought suit against the city in an attempt to stop the grading of K street. She made no attempt to protect her lots, either by filling, diking, or by opening.the old drains, which the city would doubtless have permitted after the drain in K street was completed. This was before the rains set in. The evidence sufficiently shows that this would have been permitted, since the city, in about two days after the first accumulation of water, as appellant admits, \\\\u201cdrained it out the best they could,\\\\u201d by digging a ditch in the alley; and in the spring she says, \\\\u201cThey drained it all out and finally put in a box.\\\\u201d The testimony of both the appellant and her husband shows that, neither before the fall rains nor after, did they, themselves do anything whatever, either to protect the property from water or to drain it off after it accumulated. Surface water being a common enemy, they had the same right to protect their property from it as the city had to protect its streets. 4 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (6th ed.), \\\\u00a7 1733.\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is clear that there is no liability on the part of a municipal corporation for not exercising the discretionary or legislative powers it may possess to improve streets, and, as part of such improvement, to construct gutters or provide other means of draining for surface-waters, so as to prevent them from flowing upon the adjoining lots. And even when the work of grading the streets has been entered upon, there is not ordinarily, if ever, any liability to the adjoining owner arising merely from the non-action of the corporation in not providing means for keeping surface-waters from property situate below the established grade of the street. There are, indeed, cases which go further, and assert that there is no such liability where, in making improvements upon streets or elsewhere, authorized by law, surface-waters are purposely turned from one\\\\u2019s own land to that of another,\\\\u2014 from the street directly upon the adjacent property owner.\\\\u201d 4 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (6th ed.), \\\\u00a7 1734.\\\\nIt would be worse than useless to attempt to harmonize the wilderness of decisions from other states on the questions here involved. Some of them follow the common law rule, others the opposite rule of the civil law, and still others a modified form of the one or the other. So far as we are able to discover by a careful reading of the authorities cited by the appellant, they nearly all arose upon a change of an established grade and not upon an initial grading of the street. In none of them was there a statute involved such as we have here. Manifestly they would not apply under the provisions of our statute which expressly limits recovery to injury by changes of grade. Moreover, they differ widely in their facts from the case before us. In view of the \\'statute as construed in Ettor v. Tacoma, supra, and the rule as to surface water as announced in Cass v. Dicks, supra, we are compelled to hold that the evidence here fails to make a prima ;facie case against the city. The judgment is affirmed.\\\\nDunbar, C.

It appears that the parties executed the lease in question on March 8, 1971, although the lease was dated December 31, 1970, and was to cover a term of 6 months, which was to commence on January 1,1971, and end on June 30,1971.\\\\nThe lease in question also contained an option to purchase. The testimony of the defendant indicates that he thought he was purchasing the house rather than renting it. His testimony also indicates that the house contained a number of defects when he entered into the lease and it indicates that he was aware of some of the defects when he agreed to rent the house, but not all of them.\\\\nThe trial court concluded that the defendant was guilty of unlawful detainer of the premises rented to him by the plaintiff. However, it refused to enforce the provisions of what it termed the \\\\u201cpurported lease.\\\\u201d It found that the reasonable rental for the period of occupancy of the premises was the sum of $50 per month commencing with March 3, 1971, until such time as the defendant removed himself. In effect, the court held the lease was invalid. The court also held that a writ of restitution should issue to the sheriff to require the surrender of possession if the defendant did not voluntarily withdraw and that damages for the period March 3, 1971, through April 3, 1972, were to be doubled if the defendant did not surrender the premises by April 3, 1972. The defendant appeals, although the plaintiff does not cross-appeal from the court\\\\u2019s findings.\\\\nThe primary contention raised by the defendant is that the trial court erred in refusing to accept evidence as to his affirmative defense of breach of implied warranty of habitability. The defendant argues that the plaintiff\\\\u2019s failure to maintain the premises in a habitable condition constitutes a failure of consideration upon the part of the plaintiff and relieves the defendant of his obligation to pay rent. We agree that the tenant should have been permitted to introduce evidence at trial in support of this theory of defense.\\\\nThe premises in question, according to the testimony of the defendant, contained a number of defects including a lack of heat, no hot water tank, broken windows, a broken door, water running through the bedroom, an improperly seated and leaking toilet, a leaking sink in the bathroom, broken water pipes in the yard and termites in the basement. No objection was made to the introduction of this testimony. The testimony of the defendant also indicates that he painted the interior and made repairs upon the premises, but ceased making repairs when he learned of a municipal court action being initiated against the plaintiff as a result of numerous housing code violations within the house. In addition, the record reveals that the landlord was informed of the defects and was prosecuted successfully for violations of the Seattle housing code.\\\\nDuring the trial the defendant attempted to introduce the testimony of two housing inspectors as to the housing code violations which existed on the premises. The trial court sustained the plaintiff\\\\u2019s objections to this testimony upon the theory that the condition of the premises was not relevant to the issue before the court. We disagree with the reasoning of the trial court in refusing to accept the evidence as to the condition of the premises, although it should be stated that this issue has not been heretofore specifically addressed in this jurisdiction in relation to our unlawful detainer statutes.\\\\nThroughout the United States, the old rule of caveat emptof in the leasing of premises has been undergoing judicial scrutiny.\\\\nIn Pines v. Perssion, 14 Wis. 2d 590, 596, 111 N.W.2d 409 (1961), the court stated:\\\\nTo follow the old rule of no implied warranty of habitability in leases would, in our opinion, be inconsistent with the current legislative policy concerning housing standards. The need and social desirability of adequate housing for people in this era of rapid population increases is too important to be rebuffed by that obnoxious legal clich\\\\u00e9, caveat emptor. Permitting landlords to rent \\\\u201ctumble-down\\\\u201d houses is at least a contributing cause of such problems as urban blight, juvenile delinquency, and high property taxes for conscientious landowners.\\\\nSee Reste Realty Corp. v. Cooper, 53 N.J. 444, 251 A.2d 268 (1969); Marini v. Ireland, 56 N.J. 130, 265 A.2d 526 (1970); Lemle v. Breeden, 51 Hawaii 426, 462 P.2d 470 (1969); Javins v. First Nat\\\\u2019l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925, 27 L. Ed. 2d 185, 91 S. Ct. 186 (1970), and Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill. 2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).\\\\nIn Lemle v. Breeden, supra, the court reviewed the rule of caveat emptor and the current trend toward finding an implied warranty of habitability in leases, and stated on page 433:\\\\nThe application of an implied warranty of habitability in leases gives recognition to the changes in leasing transactions today. It affirms the fact that a lease is, in essence, a sale as well as a transfer of an estate in land and is, more importantly, a contractual relationship. From that contractual relationship an implied warranty of habitability and fitness for the purposes intended is a just and necessary implication. It is a doctrine which has its counterparts in the law of sales and torts and one which when candidly countenanced is impelled by the nature of the transaction and contemporary housing realities. Legal fictions and artificial exceptions to wooden rules of property law aside, we hold that in the lease of a dwelling house, such as in this case, there is an implied warranty of habitability and fitness for the use intended.\\\\n(Footnote omitted.)\\\\nIn Javins v. First Nat\\\\u2019l Realty Corp., supra, the court analyzed the various exceptions to the common-law rule that the lessor has no duty to repair and stated on page 1078:\\\\nThese as well as other similar cases demonstrate that some courts began some time ago to question the common law\\\\u2019s assumptions that the land was the most important feature of a leasehold and that the tenant could feasibly make any necessary repairs himself. Where those assumptions no longer reflect contemporary housing patterns, the courts have created exceptions to the general rule that landlords have no duty to keep their premises in repair.\\\\nIt is overdue for courts to admit that these assumptions are no longer true with regard to all urban housing. Today\\\\u2019s urban tenants, the vast majority of whom live in multiple dwelling houses, are interested, not in the land, but solely in \\\\u201ca house suitable for occupation.\\\\u201d Furthermore, today\\\\u2019s city dweller usually has a single, specialized skill unrelated to maintenance work; he is unable to make repairs like the \\\\u201cjack-of-all-trades\\\\u201d farmer who was the common law\\\\u2019s model of the lessee. Further, unlike his agrarian predecessor who often remained on one piece of land for his entire life, urban tenants today are more mobile than ever before. A tenant\\\\u2019s tenure in a specific apartment will often not be sufficient to justify efforts at repairs. In addition, the increasing complexity of today\\\\u2019s dwellings renders them much more difficult to repair than the structures of earlier times. In a multiple dwelling repair may require access to equipment and areas in the control of the landlord. Low and middle income tenants, even if they were interested in making repairs, would be unable to obtain any financing for major repairs since they have no long-term interest in the property.\\\\n(Footnotes omitted.)\\\\nWe find the reasoning of these cases extremely persuasive. Any realistic analysis of the lessor-lessee or landlord-tenant situation leads to the conclusion that the tenant\\\\u2019s promise to pay rent is in exchange for the landlord\\\\u2019s promise to provide a livable dwelling. As Judge Skelly Wright stated in the Javins case on page 1074:\\\\nWhen American city dwellers, both rich and poor, seek \\\\u201cshelter\\\\u201d today, they seek a well known package of goods and services \\\\u2014 a package which includes not merely walls and ceilings, but also adequate heat, light and ventilation, serviceable plumbing facilities, secure windows and doors, proper sanitation, and proper maintenance.\\\\n(Footnote omitted.) Javins v. First Nat\\'l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925, 27 L. Ed. 2d 185, 91 S. Ct. 186 (1970). The value of the lease today then, whether it is oral or written, is that it gives the tenant a place to live, and he expects not just space but a dwelling that protects him from the elements of the environment without subjecting him to health hazards.\\\\nIn House v. Thornton, 76 Wn.2d 428, 457 P.2d 199 (1969), we rejected the doctrine of caveat emptor as it applied to the sale of a new residence and found an implied warranty that the structure is fit for the buyer\\\\u2019s intended purpose. In doing so, we noted that the old rule of caveat emptor has little relevance to the sale of a brand-new house by a vendor-builder to a first buyer for the purposes of occupancy. By analogy, the old rule of caveat emptor has little relevance to the renting of premises in our society. There can be little justification for following a rule that was developed for an agrarian society and has failed to keep pace with modern day realities. We therefore hold that in all contracts for the renting of premises, oral or written, there is an implied warranty of habitability and breach of this warranty constitutes a defense in an unlawful detainer action. See Javins v. First Nat\\\\u2019l Realty Corp., supra; Lund v. MacArthur, 51 Hawaii 473, 462 P.2d 482 (1969); Marini v. Ireland, 56 N.J. 130, 265 A.2d 526 (1970); Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill. 2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).\\\\nIt can be argued, however, that the defendant should not be entitled to the protection of an implied warranty of habitability since he knew of a substantial number of defects when he rented the premises and the rent was reduced from $87 per month to $50 per month. We believe this type of bargaining by the landlord with the tenant is contrary to public policy and the purpose of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability. A disadvantaged tenant should not be placed in a position of agreeing to live in an uninhabitable premises. Housing conditions, such as the record indicates exist in the instant case, are a health hazard, not only to the individual tenant, but to the community which is exposed to said individual. As the court recognized in Pines v. Perssion, supra, such housing conditions are at least a contributing cause of such problems as urban blight, juvenile delinquency and high property taxes for the conscientious landowners.\\\\nOur belief that public policy demands such a result is reinforced by our review of Laws of 1973, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 207, which became effective July 16, 1973. The legislature in passing this bill and the Governor in signing it have recognized that public policy demands this result. Laws of 1973, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 207, provides in part:\\\\nSec. 6. The landlord will at all times during the tenancy keep the premises fit for human habitation, and shall in particular:\\\\n(1) Maintain the premises to substantially comply with any applicable code, statute, ordinance, or regulation governing their maintenance or operation, which the legislative body enacting the applicable code, statute, ordinance or regulation could enforce as to the premises rented;\\\\n(2) Maintain the roofs, floors, walls, chimneys, fireplaces, foundations, and all other structural components in reasonably good repair so as to be usable and capable of resisting any and all normal forces and loads to which they may be subjected;\\\\n(5) Except where the condition is attributable to normal wear and tear, make repairs and arrangements necessary to put and keep the premises in as good condition as it by law or rental agreement should have been, at the commencement of the tenancy;\\\\n(7) Maintain all electrical, plumbing, heating, and other facilities and appliances supplied by him in reasonably good working order;\\\\n(8) Maintain the dwelling unit in reasonably weather-tight condition;\\\\n(10) Except where the building is not equipped for the purpose, provide facilities adequate to supply heat and water and hot water as reasonably required by the tenant;\\\\nSec. 8. The tenant shall be current in the payment of rent before exercising any of th\\\\u00e9 remedies accorded him under the provisions of this chapter: Provided, That this section shall not be construed as limiting the tenant\\\\u2019s civil remedies for negligent or intentional damages: Provided Further, That this section shall not be construed as limiting the tenant\\\\u2019s right in an unlawful detainer proceeding to raise the defense that there is no rent due and owing.\\\\nSec. 10.\\\\n(6) Nothing in this section shall prevent the tenant from agreeing with the landlord to undertake the repairs himself in return for cash payment or a reasonable reduction in rent, the agreement thereof to be agreed upon between the parties, and such agreement does not alter the landlord\\\\u2019s obligations under this chapter.\\\\nIt may also be argued that the defendant should not be afforded the protection of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability since the defendant signed a lease which contained an option to purchase. However, as heretofore stated, the trial court failed to recognize the validity of the lease. There is no cross-appeal from this determination and we are therefore bound by the trial court\\\\u2019s decision.\\\\nThe plaintiff argues that the trial court was correct in disregarding the Seattle housing code as it was improperly pleaded and no properly authenticated copy of the housing code was offered. These issues were not before the court when it rejected the testimony of the housing inspectors. It was not until after the court had rejected the testimony of the housing inspectors on the basis of their testimony being irrelevant that the housing code was offered into evidence. Had the court rejected the housing code on the grounds suggested by the plaintiff, the defendant would have been in a position to move to amend his pleadings. The argument as to the housing code not being properly authenticated, we believe, is without merit in view of RCW 5.44.080 which states:\\\\nWhen the ordinances of any city or town are printed by authority of such municipal corporation, the printed copies thereof shall be received as prima facie evidence that such ordinances as printed and published were duly passed.\\\\nThe copy of the housing code that was offered into evidence by the defendant is printed by authority of the City of Seattle and is therefore prima facie evidence that the ordinances as printed and published were duly passed.\\\\nThe testimony relating to the housing code violations should have been admitted into evidence, and the trial court erred in ruling that the condition of the premises was not relevant to the issue of rent due and owing. While the housing code violations in and of themselves do not establish a prima facie case that the premises are uninhabitable, they are evidence which aids in establishing that the premises are uninhabitable.\\\\nThe plaintiff argues, in effect, however, that the unlawful detainer statutes are not designed for defenses such as breach of implied warranty of habitability due to the nature of the action. In light of our previous discussion, we believe this to be without merit.\\\\nOne of the basic issues in an unlawful detainer action of this nature is whether or not there is any rent due. RCW 59.12.170, which governs the entry of judgment and execution in an unlawful detainer action, states that upon a finding of default in the payment of rent, \\\\u201cthe judgment shall also declare the forfeiture of the lease, agreement or tenancy.\\\\u201d RCW 59.12.030 provides:\\\\nA tenant of real property for a term less than life is guilty of unlawful detainer either:\\\\n(3) When he continues in possession in person or by subtenant after a default in the payment of rent, and after notice in writing requiring in the alternative the payment of the rent or the surrender of the detained premises . . .\\\\nSince the affirmative defense of breach of implied warranty of habitability goes directly to the issue of rent due and owing, which is one of the basic issues in an unlawful detainer action as the above statutes indicate, we now hold said defense is available in an unlawful detainer action of this nature. See Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill. 2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).\\\\nThe defendant also contends that the trial court erred in rendering judgment in the instant case, since the amount demanded in the 3-day notice was more than the trial court found was actually due and owing. We disagree.\\\\nIn Provident Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Thrower, 155 Wash. 613, 617, 285 P. 654 (1930), we stated:\\\\nAs to the form and contents of the notice or demand, a substantial compliance with the statute is sufficient.\\\\nSee Sowers v. Lewis, 49 Wn.2d 891, 307 P.2d 1064 (1957). See also Erz v. Reese, 157 Wash. 32, 288 P. 255 (1930) (wherein we stated on page 35 that \\\\u201cwe have never adopted the strictest rule of construction as to the form or contents of such notices under our unlawful detainer statutes, chiefly for the reason, doubtless, that the statutes prescribe no form.\\\\u201d). In the Provident Mutual case the notice was defective in three respects: (1) It contained the signature of the agent rather than the owner; (2) it overstated the amount of rent due by $165 as found by the trial court; and (3) it defectively described the premises. Although we did not specifically address the issue of the overstatement of the amount of rent due, we did hold the notice substantially complied with the requirements of Rem. Comp. Stat. \\\\u00a7 812 (now RCW 59.12.030).\\\\nIn the instant case, the 3-day notice to pay rent or vacate the premises that was served upon the defendant called for the payment of $205, the balance due under the lease, plus $75 per month for July and August. There was no dispute as to the monthly rental payment under the terms of the purported lease; however, there was a conflict as to the amount of the monthly rental due for the months of July and August. The plaintiff testified the rent for those months was to be $75 per month, and the defendant testified that it was to be $50 per month. It appears that the plaintiff\\\\u2019s demand for rental in the notice was in conformity with his good faith determination as to the amount of rental due, and that the defendant was not prejudiced as he could have tendered to the plaintiff the amount of rental due according to his understanding, of the agreement. See C. J. Peck, Landlord and Tenant Notices, 31 Wash. L. Rev. 51, 61 (1956). In tendering the amount due to the plaintiff, of course, he would deduct that amount due which he believed he was relieved from paying due to the landlord\\\\u2019s breach of his implied warranty of habitability.\\\\nWe believe that under the above facts, the plaintiff\\\\u2019s demand for rental was in substantial compliance with the statute and the fact that there was a dispute as to the amount of rent due, which was later determined contrary to the plaintiff, should not invalidate the unlawful detainer proceeding.\\\\nThe defendant also contends that the portion of RCW 59.12.170, which authorizes the doubling of damages, is unconstitutional as it is in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution.\\\\nWe need not reach this issue in light of the passage of the \\\\u201cResidential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973\\\\u201d (Laws of 1973, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 207), which eliminated the mandatory double damage provision from the law.\\\\nWhere substantial legislative or decisional changes in the applicable statutory provisions have been made, thereby precluding the imposition of the challenged provision, the constitutional issue need not be resolved. Grays Harbor Paper Co. v. Grays Harbor County, 74 Wn.2d 70, 442 P.2d 967 (1968); State School Directors Ass\\\\u2019n v. Department of Labor & Indus., 82 Wn.2d 367, 510 P.2d 818 (1973). See also State v. Vidal, 82 Wn.2d 74, 508 P.2d 158 (1973); State v. Baker, 81 Wn.2d 281, 501 P.2d 284 (1972).\\\\nAs we stated in Sorenson v. Bellingham, 80 Wn.2d 547, 558, 496 P.2d 512 (1972):\\\\nIt is a general rule that, where only moot questions or abstract propositions are involved, or where the substantial questions involved in the trial court no longer exist, the appeal, or writ of error, should be dismissed. There is an exception to the above stated proposition. The Supreme Court may, in its discretion, retain and decide an appeal which has otherwise become moot when it can be said that matters of continuing and substantial public interest are involved. . . . This exception to the general rule obtains only where the real merits of the controversy are unsettled and a continuing question of great public importance exists.\\\\n(Citations omitted.)\\\\nGiven the passage of the new landlord-tenant act and the absence of any actual trial court imposition of double damages in the instant case, the exception to the above rule is not in force and we therefore need not comment further upon this issue.\\\\nFor the guidance of the trial court at the new trial to which the defendant is entitled, the finder of fact must make two findings where the defendant claims the landlord has breached his implied warranty of habitability: (1) Whether the evidence indicates that the premises were totally or partially uninhabitable during the period of habitation and, if so, (2) what portion, if any or all, of the defendant\\\\u2019s obligation to pay rent is relieved by the landlord\\\\u2019s total or partial breach of his implied warranty of habitability. If the finder of fact determines that the entire rental obligation is extinguished by the landlord\\\\u2019s total breach, then the action for unlawful detainer based on nonpayment of rent must fail. If, on the other hand, the court determines that the premises are partially habitable, and the tenant failed to tender to the plaintiff a sufficient amount to pay rent due for the partially habitable premises, then judgment shall be entered in accordance with RCW 59.1^2.170.\\\\nThe judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial consistent with this opinion.\\\\nHale, C.J., and Rosellini, Hamilton, Stafford, and Utter, JJ., concur.\\\\nEvidence of one or two minor infractions of a housing code which do not affect habitability are inconsequential and would not entitle the tenant to a reduction in rent. Also, the tenant\\\\u2019s defense does not depend on official inspection or official finding of violations of a city housing code. Javins v. First Nat\\'l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C.

That creation might well be a desirable change in Washington law, but this simply is not the case in which it should be implemented.\\\\nThe majority\\\\u2019s application of such a warranty to the defects presented in this case and even its characterization of the defendant as a mere \\\\u201ctenant\\\\u201d are unsound in light of the defendant\\\\u2019s testimony, elicited by his own counsel:\\\\nQ. And what was the agreement between you and the Foiseys [sic] relating to the purchase of that house? A. The agreement was that I was to pay $50 a month to buy the house . . . Q. So, it was your understanding that the agreement was that you were to buy the house for $50 a month? A. That was my understanding . . . Q.

What was your understanding as to what you had to do to exercise the option? A. My understanding was to clean the house up and fix it up to some degree. Q. So, in other words, you thought that\\\\u2014 A. Take care of it like a regular home owner. I figure it was mine and I was going to try to do the best I could but I run into all kinds of difficulty with the permit . . . Q. So, it was your understanding that you were purchasing the house and that is your only obligation to pay $50 a month? A. That was the whole understanding at the conception of the deal because her mother told me [objection], Q. So, the only time prior to March you were on the premises was to just look at it? A. Right. I told them I would buy and they said fine. They put me in it for $50 a month. Q. Had you done any work cleaning up the house or anything around the premises before you moved in on [sic] March? A. Oh, yes, I had to. Q. Before you moved in? A. Right, I had to. In the basement there was termites and there was things. Q. When were you doing those things? A. In February . . . Q. At that time did you have any agreement with the Foiseys [sic] as to whether or not you were going to purchase it? A. I had the agreement before I walked in that house. That\\\\u2019s when they told me you can have it for $50 a month. They wanted $87 a month. I said it isn\\\\u2019t worth it because it\\\\u2019s sitting still and the windows are out. \\'[Interruption.] Q. That understanding was that you were going to pay $50 per month? A. Correct. That is the only way I would walk in that house because I wasn\\\\u2019t in the proper position to bargain. They bargained to me because I saw a deal and I grabbed it . . . Q. As far as you were concerned, you never received any word that you were anything but a purchaser, is that right? A. To my knowledge, that was the only way I would have gone into that house as a purchaser. What would I want to rent it for I had a house of my own.\\\\nFrom that testimony it is perfectly clear that the defendant waS fully aware of the defects and deficiencies in the premises. Those defects and deficiencies were the very reason he was willing and able to negotiate lower payments.\\\\nIt requires no authority to sustain the proposition that a person who takes possession of premises with known defects, intends to repair those defects, bargains for reduced monthly payments and characterizes the transaction as a \\\\u201cdeal\\\\u201d which he \\\\u201cgrabbed,\\\\u201d neither deserves nor needs the protection of an implied warranty of habitability.\\\\nThe fact of the matter, apparent from the record, is that the defendant encountered difficulties with his continued, anticipated repairs when the housing code violations pending against the plaintiffs came to light.

The action was brought more than 3 years after the builder-vendor sold the last condominium unit, and many of the units changed hands before suit was filed. The applicable statutes of limitation properly should have barred many of the plaintiffs\\' actions. We hold that the trial court incorrectly applied the discovery rule for determining when plaintiffs\\' causes of action accrued.\\\\nThe trial court greatly extended the implied warranty of habitability beyond the contours defined by this court. The trial court also recognized a new cause of action to this jurisdiction in negligent construction. This court cannot allow sympathy for the plaintiffs to lead to the creation of a logically inconsistent and vague theory of recovery that fails to provide useful precedent. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.\\\\nYarrowood is a condominium complex located in Belle-vue. One hundred forty-four of the 155 units have private decks. Because of the steep topography and siting, there are 32 entry walkways which traverse from the parking area to provide access to unit entrances. Twenty-three of these serve only one apartment each. The bulk of the areas at issue were these private decks and walkways.\\\\nThe Declaration of Condominium (as amended) provides that private decks off individual apartments are \\\\\"limited common areas\\\\\", to which the individual apartment owner has exclusive access. The individual homeowners are solely responsible for their maintenance. Certain access walkways are also limited common areas, although the Declaration of Condominium does not specify precisely which walkways. The trial court found all these areas were \\\\\"common areas,\\\\u201d \\\\\"regardless of the subclassification of the private decks as \\'limited common areas\\'\\\\\" (Finding of fact 15; Clerk\\'s Papers, at 15) as that term is used in the Declaration of Condominium and by statute. See RCW 64.32.010(6)(b), (ll).\\\\nThe original developer, Ferguson Development Company and related corporate entities started work on the project in 1973. Ferguson intended to develop the complex in phases, and hired architect El Baylis to design the entire complex. After experimenting with various railing designs for the private decks and walkways, Ferguson adopted a wooden frame closed rail system. This involved the construction of a wall approximately 40 inches high, made of two-by-four studs enclosed on both sides with siding and gypsum board. The wall is capped by a wooden rail and joined at the bottom to the horizontal surface of the deck.\\\\nIn May 1975, when Phase I (67 apartments) was partially constructed, Ferguson defaulted and Coldwell Banker took over. From that point, Coldwell Banker was the owner, developer, construction contractor and vendor of the apartment units at Yarrowood.\\\\nWhen Coldwell Banker took over the project it hired architect Baylis to inspect and assess the project. Baylis informed Coldwell Banker that the decks and balconies were not adequately flashed at wall and\\\\/or rail junctures. In at least one instance a deck had no way to drain and would probably rot. In September 1975, Baylis notified Coldwell Banker that standing water on the flat asphalt roof of the largest building in the complex would lead to problems unless corrected. In response and as leakage became apparent and complaints were made, Coldwell Banker took corrective steps to repair or replace each of the Phase I decks that were called to its attention. Nonetheless, the trial court found the repairs and other construction changes made were ineffective to eliminate all of the problems.\\\\nColdwell Banker completed Phase I by mid-1976. The City of Bellevue Building Department issued a certificate of occupancy on June 10, 1976, although purchasers had occupied a number of units from late December 1975.\\\\nIn March 1976, Coldwell Banker contracted with architect Baylis to prepare construction drawings for Phase II, which added an additional 88 apartment units. Coldwell Banker instructed Baylis to make design changes in the walkway and deck assemblies in an attempt to avoid the problems experienced in Phase I. Phase II construction began in 1976, and on September 15, 1977, Bellevue issued a final certificate of occupancy. The last unit was sold in February 1978, some 4 years and 9 months before the commencement of the lawsuit in November 1982.\\\\nColdwell Banker turned over management of Yarrowood to the Board of Directors of the Yarrowood Homeowners Association (the Board) after substantially all of the units were sold. Following a short period in which Coldwell Banker acted as property manager, the Board hired a resident manager to handle complaints from homeowners, and to perform minor maintenance and repairs. The first manager served from early 1978 to 1980. During 1978 and 1979, he received complaints relating to 10 to 15 of the decks at Yarrowood. Some of the decks had damage which was plainly visible from public areas such as the parking lot for one of the buildings.\\\\nBy June 1979, at least one deck had so deteriorated that the homeowner asked the Board about having it rebuilt. In connection with this and other complaints being received, the Board contacted an attorney for advice on who was responsible for repairing the deteriorating decks. The Board described the problem to the attorney as a design defect. After reviewing the Declaration of Condominium, the attorney responded that in his view the responsibility for repair and maintenance of these limited common areas lay with the individual homeowners, rather than with the Board.\\\\nThe Board relayed the attorney\\'s advice to the homeowners, and took the position that these defects were not the Board\\'s responsibility. Some of the Board members had initial leakage problems which Coldwell Banker had worked on. In fact, the majority of the nine members of the Board in the years 1979 and 1980 knew during or before their service on the Board of leakage problems on Yarrowood decks.\\\\nIn November 1980, the Board contacted a second attorney for his opinion on repair responsibilities. This attorney advised if the problem was a construction defect then the Board, rather than the individual homeowners, should pursue claims against the developer on behalf of the common ownership. Upon receiving this advice, the Board specifically asked the homeowners to lodge their complaints with the Board\\'s resident manager. A number of such complaints were formally registered before the next meeting, which took place on December 18, 1980.\\\\nIn November 1982, the members of the Board filed suit in their representative capacities on behalf of both original and subsequent purchasers of affected units against Cold-well Banker, El Baylis, and Ferguson. The suit alleged defendants were liable under theories of negligent construction, breach of express and implied warranties, misrepresentation, and violations of the Consumer Protection Act, RCW 19.86.\\\\nAs of that time, 74 out of the 155 units had changed hands from the original purchasers to subsequent purchasers. By May 1984, the month of trial, the number of units owned by subsequent purchasers had risen to 81, constituting a majority of the units in the complex.\\\\nThe trial court found plaintiffs\\' suit was timely brought within the applicable statute of limitations, reasoning that the claims accrued at the December 18, 1980 meeting, when the Board had notice that the deck and walkway problems were widespread throughout the project. The court found that\\\\nAlthough plaintiffs received some isolated complaints from unit owners of water leaks and stains with respect to the private decks attached to the unit, there was not a sufficient number of complaints or sufficient quality of the complaints received to indicate a project-wide problem with substantially all decks and the degree to which the decks were affected until December 1980.\\\\nFinding of fact 30; Clerk\\'s Papers, at 20-21.\\\\nThe court held there was no liability under the Washington Consumer Protection Act, nor under plaintiffs\\' theory of breach of express warranty or misrepresentation. Plaintiffs have not appealed those rulings.\\\\nThe court noted that the applicable provisions of the uniform building code and industry standards required that the decks, balconies, walkways, ramps, and stairway structures be constructed in a watertight manner. It found, however, that the areas were not so constructed, and allowed water to penetrate from the time of original construction. These defects, both latent and patent, the court held, led to rotting and the substantial impairment of the structures.\\\\nThe court found that rotting conditions between initial occupancy and 1980 were known by the homeowners, who complained to Coldwell Banker, which responded to all complaints by making repairs and replacements. It found, however, that the complaints were not in every case communicated to the Board.\\\\nA determination was made by the court that the defective conditions were caused by negligent construction practices which left\\\\nthe largest majority of the affected structures in Yarro-wood unfit for their ordinary and intended purpose and dangerous to use within a very short time after their construction. . . .\\\\nAlthough structurally safe for the buyer\\'s intended purpose at the time of construction and initial purchase by individual owners, a number of the private decks, balconies and walkways became unsafe through the action of dry rot from water trapped as a result of construction defects.\\\\nFindings of fact 19, 20; Clerk\\'s Papers, at 18. It held that both the original and subsequent purchasers could recover for the. entire damages to common areas and limited common areas under a negligence theory, and that the original owners could also recover under implied warranties of habitability.\\\\nColdwell Banker, as owner-developer-builder-vendor of the complex, which was constructed for sale to the general public, was determined to owe a duty of proper construction, a duty which includes the nonnegligent construction of elements within the common and limited common areas. The court further held that no privity of contract need exist in order for Coldwell Banker to be liable for damages caused by negligent performance of its contractual duty.\\\\nColdwell Banker was also held to have impliedly warranted to the original purchasers that the common and limited common areas were fit for their ordinary and intended purpose, that the applicable building code provisions were complied with and that the construction was performed in a proper and workmanlike manner with respect to building methods, techniques, or materials used. The court concluded that Coldwell Banker breached the implied warranty of habitability (thus defined), and was liable to plaintiffs for damages sustained as a proximate result of this breach.\\\\nOf the $378,758 in damages awarded by the trial court, $87,680 represented repair costs to private decks which were limited common areas exclusive to units owned by subsequent purchasers. No separate finding was made with respect to walkways for which damages were awarded, but which serve secondary purchasers\\' units.\\\\nThree issues are raised on appeal: (1) whether the trial court correctly determined the time the plaintiffs\\' causes of action accrued for purposes of the discovery rule; (2) whether the court properly applied the implied warranty of habitability theory as developed by our courts; and (3) whether the trial court erred in recognizing a new cause of action in negligent construction.\\\\nStatute of Limitations\\\\nColdwell Banker acknowledges the Board\\'s standing to sue on behalf of two or more individual condominium owners with similar claims pursuant to RCW 64.32.240. That statute provides, in part:\\\\nWithout limiting the rights of any apartment owner, actions may be brought as provided by law and by the rules of court by the manager or board of directors, in either case in the discretion of the board of directors, on behalf of two or more of the apartment owners, as their respective interests may appear, with respect to any cause of action relating to the common areas and facilities or more than one apartment. . . .\\\\n(Italics ours.) The Board has standing to sue on behalf of and as a surrogate for the individual homeowners. Coldwell Banker argues with merit that this statutory grant of standing does not accord the Board or the Association the status of a separate juristic entity. The Association is not incorporated. It has no life independent of the individual homeowners who are by statute and under the terms of the Declaration of Condominium required to be members of the Association. The rights being asserted, and the claims being made, belong to the individual homeowners. As found by the trial court, the lawsuit was brought in the names of the nine then members of the Board of Directors of the Association in their representative capacities, not in the name of the Board or Association as a separate entity.\\\\nThe trial court, however, determined that the claims asserted here accrued at the time the Board had notice that the deck and walkway problems were widespread throughout the project. Neither RCW 64.32.240 nor the discovery rule support such a conclusion. RCW 64.32-.240 authorizes the Board to bring suit on behalf of two or more apartment owners. There is no requirement that the majority or even that a substantial number of apartments be affected. The trial court\\'s conclusion that, despite the plain meaning of the statute, the Board was required to wait to bring suit until \\\\\"a sufficient number\\\\\" of apartment owners were affected is unjustified.\\\\nA statute which is plain needs no construction. King Cy. v. Seattle, 70 Wn.2d 988, 425 P.2d 887 (1967). It is neither the function nor the prerogative of courts to modify legislative enactments. Anderson v. Seattle, 78 Wn.2d 201, 471 P.2d 87 (1970). The trial court\\'s formulation of a requirement of a \\\\\"sufficient number\\\\\" of affected units is not supported by the statute and is unworkably vague. The Board\\'s strategic decision to bring suit at the time that it did will not be aided by this court with a reading not sustained by the language or the spirit of RCW 64.32.240.\\\\nThe trial court\\'s application of the discovery rule is inconsistent with the analysis applied by this court in White v. Johns-Manville Corp., 103 Wn.2d 344, 348, 693 P.2d 687 (1985): \\\\\"[A] cause of action accrues at the time the plaintiff knew or should have known all of the essential elements of the cause of action.\\\\\" Awareness of the essential elements of a cause of action and awareness that one has a cause of action are not necessarily the same, for purposes of a statute of limitation. Sahlie v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 99 Wn.2d 550, 554, 663 P.2d 473 (1983). This court made that distinction in Sahlie to underscore our position that a cause of action accrues when a plaintiff discovers, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered, the elements of the cause of action, and not when the plaintiff realized that they had a legally cognizable injury.\\\\nThe applicable statute of limitations in this lawsuit is 3 years from the date of discovery under RCW 4.16.080(2). That statute should operate, however, as of the time the homeowners actually knew or reasonably should have known of the defects that comprised the elements of their causes of action. The trial court acknowledged that many of the individual homeowners knew and complained of defects as early as 1976. The trial court found that between 1976 and 1980 the owners of 13 units were aware of damage that required repair. The Board was sufficiently concerned by June 1979 to consult a lawyer as to who had the responsibility to repair the deteriorating decks. In the face of this abundant evidence of actual notice to the Board and to the individual apartment owners, the trial court\\'s conclusion that the cause of action did not accrue until December 1980 is unsupported by the record.\\\\nImplied Warranty op Habitability\\\\nThe implied warranty of habitability in Washington is a limited one:\\\\n[W]hen a vendor-builder sells a new house to its first intended occupant, he impliedly warrants that the foundations supporting it are firm and secure and that the house is structurally safe for the buyer\\'s intended purpose of living in it.\\\\nHouse v. Thornton, 76 Wn.2d 428, 436, 457 P.2d 199 (1969). House and progeny have been applied in this state to grant recovery to the first intended occupants for egregious, fundamental defects in homes which, as the name of the warranty indicates, render the houses unfit to be lived in. The plaintiffs in House contended with a house with a foundation so faulty that the basement, walls, floors and foundation slipped and cracked, and the supporting terrain slid away from the foundation.\\\\nThis court has not been anxious to extend the implied warranty of habitability beyond its present boundaries. Frickel v. Sunnyside Enters., 106 Wn.2d 714, 725 P.2d 422 (1986) (court declined to extend implied warranty of habitability to sale of apartment complex despite serious foundation defects and improper construction, where property was not built for resale and sales contract contained express disclaimers of such warranty).\\\\nOther cases in Washington brought under the implied warranty of habitability premise recovery upon proof of defects which profoundly compromise the essential nature of the subject property as a dwelling. Klos v. Gockel, 87 Wn.2d 567, 554 P.2d 1349 (1976) (recovery denied where patio and backyard were damaged by a mud slide and the settling of fill, but house itself suffered only minimal damage); Allen v. Anderson, 16 Wn. App. 446, 557 P.2d 24 (1976) (alleged foundation faults, cracks and bows in retaining walls, dismissed on other grounds); Gay v. Cornwall, 6 Wn. App. 595, 494 P.2d 1371 (1972) (leaks in roof, plumbing defective, sewer pipe dumped raw sewage into crawl space, furnace motor burned out, drain field washed away).\\\\nThe doctrine of implied warranty of habitability imposes liability upon builder-vendors in favor of original purchasers of residential property for egregious defects in the fundamental structure of a home. The warranty does not provide recovery for defects in exterior, nonstructural elements adjacent to the dwelling unit. The instant case involves defects similar to those in Klos v. Gockel, supra. In Klos, a landslide caused damage to the plaintiff\\'s patio, but not to the house itself. The trial court ruled that the slide, while not injuring the foundation, rendered the residence unfit for occupancy, \\\\\"if not in terms of actual danger, then at least in terms of threatening one\\'s peace of mind\\\\\". Klos, at 569. This court overruled that holding, noting that the plaintiffs never moved out of the house and were still occupying it at time of trial. Klos does not support an extension of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability for mere defects in workmanship. The Klos court denied recovery to the plaintiffs, holding that:\\\\nThe law of implied warranty is not broad enough to make the builder-vendor of a house absolutely liable for all mishaps occurring within the boundaries of the improved real property.\\\\nKlos, at 571-72.\\\\nIn the case at bar, some of the damaged areas were decks, similar in use to the patio area in Klos. Others were walkways that may have comprised the sole means of access to the apartments, although the record fails to make this clear. Finding of fact 15; Clerk\\'s Papers, at 15. As to the access walkways, one could plausibly argue that the defects occurred in an essential portion of the dwelling itself. Unfortunately, the record does not distinguish among the units, and there was no allegation that any apartment owner was prevented from using his or her unit because of the defects. Plaintiff homeowners who were not barred by the statute of limitations could plausibly maintain an action for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, where they were unable to enter their dwelling units safely. Such a defect could be said to render a home unit unfit for its intended purpose. Unfortunately, the record before this court is insufficient for purposes of making such a determination.\\\\nNegligent Construction\\\\nCurrently, the State of Washington does not recognize a cause of action for negligent construction on behalf of individual homeowners. Beyond the terms expressed in the contract of sale, the only recognized duty owing from a builder-vendor of a newly completed residence to its first purchaser is that embodied in the implied warranty of habitability, which arises from the sale transaction. House v. Thornton, supra at 436. Plaintiff homeowners faced with losses that are not of their own making present a sympathetic case, and we understand the desire of the trial court to fashion a remedy. We must exercise caution, however, that we do not unduly upset the law upon which expectations are built and business is conducted.\\\\nThe theory advanced by the trial court is a peculiar combination of tort and contract law, closely related to the tort law of products liability. Comment, Manufacturer\\'s Liability to Remote Purchasers for \\\\\"Economic Loss\\\\\" Damages\\\\u2014 Tort or Contract?, 114 U. Pa. L. Rev. 539 (1966). Dean Prosser characterized the law of products liability as a \\\\\"hybrid, born of the illicit intercourse of tort and contract, unique in the law.\\\\\" W. Prosser, Torts 634 (4th ed. 1971).\\\\nInitially, plaintiffs who suffered personal injuries from defective products could only reach the manufacturer under warranty theories. Courts, however, had difficulty meshing the inapposite \\\\\"intricacies of the law of sales,\\\\\" Prosser, The Assault Upon the Citadel, 69 Yale L.J. 1099 (1960), such as notice and privity, with the plight presented by injured consumers who did not have a direct contractual relationship with the manufacturer. Accordingly, the doctrine fell prey to logical difficulties inherent in this procrustean approach, which addressed problems of unsafe conduct with a legal theory premised on receiving the benefit of a bargain. Pennsylvania Glass Sand Corp. v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 652 F.2d 1165, 1168-69 (3d Cir. 1981).\\\\nThe first cases holding manufacturers liable for injuries caused by their products in the absence of privity of contract used a negligence theory. The landmark decision in this area was MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (1916) (Cardozo, J.). MacPherson has been accepted in every jurisdiction in the United States to provide a remedy to plaintiffs injured by manufactured items that are dangerous if negligently made. W. Prosser, Torts \\\\u00a7 96, at 642-43 (4th ed. 1971). Courts reasoned that privity of contract should not stand as a bar to plaintiff consumers who suffered physical injury from a product negligently made.\\\\nAs a matter of public policy, it is entirely reasonable to expect manufacturers of goods for sale to the general public to assume responsibility for the safety of their product. In Seely v. White Motor Co., 63 Cal. 2d 9, 403 P.2d 145, 45 Cal. Rptr. 17 (1965), Justice Traynor denied recovery to a plaintiff who had pleaded lost profits as the only damages under a negligence theory. Justice Traynor stated at page 18:\\\\nThe distinction that the law has drawn between tort recovery for physical injuries and warranty recovery for economic loss is not arbitrary and does not rest on the \\\\\"luck\\\\\" of one plaintiff in having an accident causing physical injury. The distinction rests, rather, on an understanding of the nature of the responsibility a manufacturer must undertake in distributing his products. He can appropriately be held liable for physical injuries caused by defects by requiring his goods to match a standard of safety defined in terms of conditions that create unreasonable risks of harm. He cannot be held for the level of performance of his products in the consumer\\'s business unless he agrees that the product was designed to meet the consumer\\'s demands. A consumer should not be charged at the will of the manufacturer with bearing the risk of physical injury when he buys a product on the market. He can, however, be fairly charged with the risk that the product will not match his economic expectations unless the manufacturer agrees that it will. . . .\\\\nThis court has acknowledged the extreme confusion in the development of our own case law, and we have, in the past, allowed recovery under a negligence theory for lost profits standing alone (upon proof of causation and breach of duty). Berg v. General Motors Corp., 87 Wn.2d 584, 591, 555 P.2d 818 (1976). In Berg, this court noted the convoluted history of products liability doctrine, conceded that \\\\\"[cjourts are anxious to find some legal theory sufficient to protect the public interest\\\\\", Berg, at 593, and made a policy-based decision to allow damages to a commercial fisherman for the anticipated value of a fish catch that was lost when his boat was laid up for repairs of defendant manufacturer\\'s negligently built motor.\\\\nThe instant case, however, presents a leap beyond the theory applied in Berg. The plaintiffs have alleged no injury beyond the affected areas themselves, and no damages beyond the cost of repair. In its effort to find recovery for the plaintiffs, the trial court formulated a theory of recovery in negligence that overlooks the intricacies and logical inconsistencies inherent in the approach.\\\\nCommentators and courts faced with this issue have found it necessary to distinguish economic loss from physical harm or property damage. The distinction is usually drawn depending on the nature of the defect and the manner in which the damage occurred. Defects of quality are evidenced by internal deterioration, and designated as economic loss, while loss stemming from defects that cause accidents involving violence or collision with external objects is treated as physical injury. Pennsylvania Glass Sand, at 1169-70. See Note, Economic Loss in Products Liability Jurisprudence, 66 Colum. L. Rev. 917, 918 (1966); see also Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 626 F.2d 280 (3d Cir. 1980).\\\\nTort law has traditionally redressed injuries properly classified as physical harm. W. Prosser, Torts \\\\u00a7 101, at 665 (4th ed. 1971). Tort law is concerned with the obligations imposed by law, rather than by bargain. As a matter of public policy, it is appropriate that a duty be imposed on manufacturers to produce products that will not unreasonably endanger the safety and health of the public, whether the ultimate impact of the danger is suffered by people, other property, or on the product itself. In contrast, contract law protects expectation interests, and provides an appropriate set of rules when an individual bargains for a product of particular quality or for a particular use.\\\\nIn cases such as the present one where only the defective product is damaged, the court should identify whether the particular injury amounts to economic loss or physical damage. In drawing the distinction, the determinative factor should not be the items for which damages are sought, such as repair costs. Rather, the line between tort and contract must be drawn by analyzing interrelated factors such as the nature of the defect, the type of risk, and the manner in which the injury arose. These factors bear directly on whether the safety-insurance policy of tort law or the expectation-bargain protection policy of warranty law is most applicable to the claim in question. Pennsylvania Glass Sand, at 1173.\\\\nThe nature of the defect here was that the decks and walkways were not of the quality desired by the buyers. The \\\\\"injury\\\\\" or damage suffered was that the decks themselves deteriorated, not through accident or violent occurrence, but through exposure to the weather.\\\\nThe plaintiffs advanced theories of recovery under the Consumer Protection Act, RCW 19.86, under a theory of misrepresentation, and under the express warranties contained in the contract of sale with the builder-vendor. The trial court correctly held that recovery was not available under any of these theories, and plaintiffs have not appealed those rulings. This is unremarkable, in that the express terms of the contract with the builder-vendor delegated the risks among the parties, and formed part of the basis of their bargain.\\\\nIn its search to provide relief where the contract did not, the trial court stretched the implied warranty of habitability beyond recognition to grant recovery to original purchasers of condominium units. The trial court then accepted the plaintiffs\\' invitation to recognize a poorly reasoned cause of action to grant recovery to subsequent purchasers. The dangers in creating such unreasoned precedent are manifest.\\\\nImposition of tort liability upon the builder-vendors would require them to become the guarantors of the complete satisfaction of future purchasers. A builder-vendor could contract to limit liability for defects with the original purchaser and then find themselves liable for the same defects to a future purchaser with whom they had absolutely no contact. The trial court\\'s formulation makes no distinction between subsequent purchasers who may have known nothing of the potential deterioration of the decks, and those buyers who may have been able to see the flaking observable to the naked eye from the exhibits before the court. The latter buyers may well have been able to account for the defects with an adjustment to the purchase price. As to such buyers, any recovery from the court would be a pure windfall.\\\\nThere is nothing in the trial court\\'s disposition of the case to limit liability for the same defects in the same units to future subsequent purchasers. In a commodity such as condominiums, it is not unthinkable that speculators could sell and resell the property rapidly enough to escape the strictures of the statute of limitations. This court will not sanction such result-oriented jurisprudence, particularly in an area of the law so vitally enmeshed in our economy and dependent on settled expectations as is the construction business. We decline to recognize a cause of action in negligent construction.\\\\nWe reverse and remand to the trial court to determine, consistent with this opinion, (1) which, if any, of the plaintiffs were not barred by the statute of limitations, and (2) which units owned by such plaintiffs had walkways so impaired that the sole means of access to the unit was dangerous to negotiate.\\\\nPearson, C.J., and Brachtenbach, Dolliver, Andersen, Goodloe, and Durham, JJ., concur.\\\\nRCW 64.32.010(6) (b) provides, in pertinent part:\\\\n\\\\\"(6) \\'Common areas and facilities\\', unless otherwise provided in the declaration as duly recorded or as it may be lawfully amended, includes: . . .\\\\n\\\\\"(b) The foundation, columns, girders, beams, supports, main walls, roofs, halls, corridors, lobbys [sic], stairs, stairways, fire escapes, and entrances and exits of the building;\\\\\"\\\\nRCW 64.32.010(11) provides, in pertinent part:\\\\n\\\\\" (11) \\'Limited common areas and facilities\\' includes those common areas and facilities designated in the declaration, as it is duly recorded or as it may be lawfully amended, as reserved for use of certain apartment or apartments to the exclusion of the other apartments.\\\\\"\\\\nColdwelI Banker cross-claimed against Baylis for recovery in the event of a finding of liability for negligent design. Both plaintiffs and Coldwell Banker dropped their claims against Baylis prior to trial. Ferguson apparently went through bankruptcy proceedings some time prior to trial.\",\"type\":\"majority\",\"author\":\"Utter, J. \\\\u2014\"},{\"text\":\"Callow, J.\\\\n(concurring in part, dissenting in part) \\\\u2014 I concur with the majority\\'s discussion of the statute of limitations and the implied warranty of habitability. I dissent, however, from the majority\\'s refusal to recognize a cause of action in negligent construction in a case such as this, where a builder has sold condominiums with latent dangerous defects. The majority reasons that no claim of negligent construction can lie because the purchasers have suffered only \\\\\"economic loss\\\\\". I submit this is unsound and unpersuasive. Purchasers of condominiums who have been the victims of shoddy and unsafe construction practices, yet who have no remedy under the implied warranty of habitability, should not be denied recovery merely because they have been fortunate to escape serious physical injury.\\\\nThe record before us shows that Coldwell Banker built and sold several condominiums with latent dangerous defects, and that such defects were the result of negligent construction. The trial court specifically found:\\\\nIn constructing the deck and railing systems in the complex, Coldwell Banker was negligent in needlessly splicing the rail cap, in failing to provide adequate drainage at the bottom of the enclosed rails and decks, in inadequately flashing the juncture of the deck and the rail wall, in using interior gypsum wallboard inside of the rail structures, rather than exterior gypsum sheathing, especially when accompanied by a failure to protect that interior wallboard by placing adequate building paper over the wallboard and\\\\/or over the top of the inside rail structure to prevent rain or other water coming into the structure through the rail cap.\\\\nAll of the defects, individually or in combination, greatly hastened the rotting of these structures.\\\\nThus, the court concluded:\\\\nAlthough structurally safe for the buyer\\'s intended purpose at the time of construction and initial purchase by individual owners, a number of the [condominiums\\'] private decks, balconies and [access] walkways became unsafe through the action of dry rot trapped as a result of construction defects.\\\\nThe trial court also noted:\\\\nSome of the defects which ultimately led to rotting . . . were not visible, such as lack of ventilation, inadequate flashing or failure to wrap gypsum board with building paper.\\\\nAs the majority points out, some of the affected purchasers may seek recovery for breach of the implied warranty of habitability. This provides but limited relief. The implied warranty of habitability protects only the first intended occupants of new condominiums, and covers only structural defects which render the condominium uninhabitable. Frickel v. Sunnyside Enters., 106 Wn.2d 714, 715-18, 725 P.2d 422 (1986); Klos v. Gockel, 87 Wn.2d 567, 571-72, 554 P.2d 1349 (1976); House v. Thornton, 76 Wn.2d 428, 436, 457 P.2d 199 (1969). It does not provide a remedy for subsequent purchaser\\\\/occupants; nor for original purchaser\\\\/ occupants of condominiums with dangerously defective decks or balconies (as opposed to access walkways), since these structures do not render the dwelling itself \\\\\"uninhabitable.\\\\\" I find no reason to cut off a subsequent purchaser from a remedy in such a situation just because the property has changed hands twice rather than only once.\\\\nThe purchaser of a condominium has the right to expect that it will be properly constructed and free of latent and dangerous defects of any kind. As explained in Oates v. JAG, Inc., 314 N.C. 276, 333 S.E.2d 222 (1985):\\\\nWe must be realistic. The ordinary purchaser of a home is not qualified to determine when or where a defect exists. Yet, the purchaser makes the biggest and most important investment in his or her life and, more times than not, on a limited budget. The purchaser can ill afford to suddenly find a latent defect in his or her home . . . and have no remedy for recourse. This happens too often. The careless work of contractors, who in the past have been insulated from liability, must cease or they must accept financial responsibility for their negligence. In our judgment, building contractors should be held to the general standard of reasonable care for the protection of anyone who may foreseeably be endangered by their negligence.\\\\nOates, at 280-81 (quoting Simmons v. Owens, 363 So. 2d 142, 143 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1978).\\\\nI would join the growing number of jurisdictions that recognize a cause of action for negligent construction. See, e.g., Oates; Council of Co-Owners Atlantis Condominium, Inc. v. Whiting-Turner Contracting Co., 308 Md. 18, 517 A.2d 336 (1986); Cosmopolitan Homes, Inc. v. Weller, 663 P.2d 1041 (Colo. 1983); Kristek v. Catron, 7 Kan. App. 2d 495, 644 P.2d 480 (1982); Velotta v. Leo Petronzio Landscaping, Inc., 69 Ohio St. 2d 376, 433 N.E.2d 147 (1982); Juliano v. Gaston, 187 N.J. Super. 491, 455 A.2d 523 (1982); Drexel Properties, Inc. v. Bay Colony Club Condominium, Inc., 406 So. 2d 515 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1981); Terlinde v. Neely, 275 S.C. 395, 271 S.E.2d 768, 10 A.L.R.4th 379 (1980); Moxley v. Laramie Builders, Inc., 600 P.2d 733 (Wyo. 1979); Brown v. Fowler, 279 N.W.2d 907 (S.D. 1979); Sabella v. Wisler, 59 Cal. 2d 21, 377 P.2d 889, 27 Cal. Rptr. 689 (1963); Fisher v. Simon, 15 Wis. 2d 207, 112 N.W.2d 705 (1961). I would hold that a purchaser may bring a claim for negligent construction against the builder-vendor of a home if the home has a latent and dangerous defect which creates a risk of personal injury. Hopefully, of course, the dangerous condition will be detected before personal injury actually occurs. In such a case, the purchaser\\'s recovery would consist of the reasonable cost of correcting the dangerous condition.\\\\nThe majority rejects this alternative, reasoning that absent physical injury or property damage, the purchaser has suffered only \\\\\"economic loss\\\\\" and thus is barred from recovery in tort. This view of negligence law has been rejected by numerous other courts. Most recently, the Maryland Supreme Court approved precisely the cause of action in negligent construction outlined above. The court added that where a latent and dangerously defective condition exists, economic loss alone is not a bar to recovery. The court said:\\\\nThe contention that a distinction should be drawn between mere \\\\\"economic loss\\\\\" and personal injury is without merit. . . .\\\\nIf there is a defect in a stairway and the purchaser repairs the defect and suffers an economic loss, should he fail to recover because he did not wait until he or some member of his family fell down the stairs and broke his neck? Does the law penalize those who are alert and prevent injury? Should it not put those who prevent personal injury on the same level as those who fail to anticipate it?\\\\nCouncil of Co-Owners Atlantis Condominium, at 34-35, quoting Barnes v. Mac Brown & Co., 264 Ind. 227, 230, 342 N.E.2d 619 (1976). The additional cases cited likewise reject any distinction between personal injury and economic loss in the context of a negligent construction claim.\\\\nRecognizing a cause of action in negligent construction affords purchasers of homes or condominiums a remedy for dangerous and shoddy construction without imposing an undue burden on builder-vendors. Since this cause of action sounds in tort, the remedy extends to both original and subsequent purchasers (i.e., privity of contract with the builder-vendor is not required). However, the builder-vendor\\'s potential liability is not unlimited, for the statute of limitations expressly bars commencement of any suit that does not accrue within 6 years of substantial completion of construction. See RCW 4.16.310. Moreover, a purchaser who brings a claim for negligent construction, but who suffers economic loss alone, must prove (1) negligence on the part of the builder-vendor caused a defective condition, (2) the defective condition is dangerous, (3) the defective condition was latent at the time of purchase. As explained in Cosmopolitan Homes, at 1045-46:\\\\nThe reason for allowing recovery only for latent or hidden defects, which have been defined as \\\\\"those manifesting themselves after purchase and which are not discoverable through reasonable inspection,\\\\\" ... is to prevent an action where mere deterioration or loss of a bargain is claimed. . . . Often a buyer is willing to accept certain deficiencies in a house in exchange for a lower purchase price. However, a buyer cannot be expected to discover structural defects which remain latent at the time of purchase.\\\\nIf a purchaser meets these requirements, there is no reason why he should not recover from the builder-vendor for negligent construction. The alternative offered by the majority is to subject the purchaser to the outworn and antiquated doctrine of caveat emptor. This court should find such an alternative unacceptable.\\\\nI would remand to the trial court to determine first, which plaintiffs are barred from recovery by the statute of limitations; second, which plaintiffs have stated a valid claim for breach of the implied warranty of habitability; and third, which plaintiffs have stated a valid claim for negligent construction as outlined above. I respectfully dissent to the extent that my proposed resolution of this case differs from that of the majority.\\\\nDore, J., concurs with Callow, J.\",\"type\":\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\",\"author\":\"Callow, J.\"}],\"attorneys\":[\"Davis, Wright, Todd, Riese & Jones, by Duncan A.

Defendant denied the agreement. The case was tried to the court and a jury. A verdict was returned in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant appeals from the judgment entered upon the verdict.\\\\nIt appears that, in the year 1905, the defendant leased lot 2, block 10, Boren & Denny\\\\u2019s addition to Seattle, from the Cyrus F. Clapp estate, for the period of five years. Defendant thereupon erected a one-story brick building upon this lot. This building consisted of several store rooms facing upon Madison street in said city. When the building was about completed, plaintiffs entered into negotiations with the defendant to lease two of these store rooms, numbered 215 and 217 Madison street. The rental and terms of the lease were agreed upon in November, 1905, and upon the 1st of December, 1905, the plaintiffs took possession of the rooms. On the 9th day of December a written lease was entered into, as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cThis indenture of lease made this 9th day of December, 1905, by and between R. J. Ferguson of the city of Seattle, county of King, state of Washington, party of the first part (hereinafter called the lessor) and A. P. Hockersmith, of said city, county and state, party of the second part, (hereinafter called the lessee),\\\\n\\\\u201cWitnesseth: That the said lessor does by these presents lease and demise unto the lessee that certain store room, designated and known as Nos. \\\\u00a315 and \\\\u00a317 Madison street, situated upon lots \\\\u00a3, in Boren & Denny\\\\u2019s addition to the city of Seattle, for a period of two years from the first day of January, 1906, to the 31st day of December, 1907, for the rent or sum of thirty-six hundred dollars ($3,600) payable in gold coin of the United States of America in twenty-four (\\\\u00a34) equal monthly installments amounting to one hundred and fifty dollars ($150) payable in advance on the first day of each and every month during the term of this lease. That said lessee hereby accepts said premises for the term of two years and agrees to pay therefor the sum of thirty-six hundred dollars ($3,600) said sum to be paid at the office of John Davis & Co., No. 709 Second avenue, Seattle, Washington, in the manner and at the times hereinafter specified. That said lessee agrees to pay any and all charges for heat, light and water rates, which shall become due or shall be taxed or assessed against said premises during the term of this lease, and further agrees to make all necessary repairs of whatsoever nature to the interior of said premises, and to deliver up said premises at the expiration of this lease in as good condition as they are now in, excepting the necessary wear and tear thereof and damages by the elements or fire. That said lessee, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns shall hold harmless said lessor\\' from all damages or accidents of every kind or nature whatsoever that may occur on said premises. That said lessee shall not use said premises for saloon or restaurant purposes, nor let or sub-let the whole or any part thereof, nor make or permit to be made any changes \\\\u2022 or alterations whatsoever without the written consent of the said lessor, or John Davis & Co., his agents, nor assign this lease or any part thereof without said written consent. That said lessee shall not use said premises for immoral or illegal purposes, nor under any circumstances permit gambling or the sale of intoxicating liquors upon said premises. It is hereby agreed that if any rent shall be due and unpaid, or if default shall be made in any of the covenants or agreements herein contained, it shall be lawful for the said lessor or John Davis & Co., his agents, to reenter said premises and remove all persons therefrom. That the said lessor, or his agents, shall have the right to enter said premises at all reasonable times, and shall have the further right to place Tor Rent\\\\u2019 signs on said premises thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of this lease.\\\\n\\\\u201cIn witness whereof the parties hereunto have set their hands and seals the day and year first above written.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe lease was signed, sealed, and acknowledged. After the plaintiffs had occupied the building about three months, the defendant sold and conveyed all of his interest in the property to the Cyrus F. Clapp estate, the owner of the fee, and thereafter, on April 2, 1906, the Cyrus F. Clapp estate sold and conveyed the property to Sullivan & Considine. The plaintiffs thereafter, on April 9, with notice of the sale, recorded the lease in the county auditor\\\\u2019s office. Thereafter, in October or November of the same year, the city of Seattle, by its contractors, entered upon the street in front of the property, tore up its sidewalks, and cut away the street some eighteen feet, leaving for several months no means of ingress to or egress from the premises. The plaintiffs brought this action against the defendant for damages caused thereby, and alleged, in paragraph 6 of the complaint, the following:\\\\n\\\\u201cThat at the time of the lease as aforesaid the said premises were desirable particularly for the purpose of plaintiffs\\\\u2019 said business as well as valuable for other commercial purposes, the same being located at 215 and 216 Madison street in the city of Seattle, then and there a popular and valuable location in the business district of said city; then graded and improved and easily accessible to the general public; that at the said time as aforesaid there was then in contemplation a great public improvement of the city known generally and publicly as the 2d Avenue regrade, and which, if the same took place during the life of the said lease, proposed it would, by reason of the interruption and disturbance in the enjoyment of the said premises render the said leasehold of little value as was then and there mutually agreed. That at the time of making the said lease, the plaintiffs and said defendants, by reason of the uncertain condition with respect to the contemplated change of grade in said Madison street, made no provision except as aforesaid in said indenture of lease regarding the remodeling and rebuilding of the said premises and store rooms situated therein. The said defendant landlord and these plaintiffs then and there further agreeing, by an oral, collateral contemporaneous agreement that if the said public improvement did take place during the life of the said lease, with its then agreed attendant damage, and the beneficial enjoyment of the possession be interrupted, that the said defendant R. J. Ferguson would remodel, reconstruct and repair said building as leased, by lowering the floors of the store rooms so leased, to wit eighteen feet, so as to put the same to the level of said Madison street, these plaintiffs agreeing to remove to said store rooms when said floors should have been so lowered. That by so lowering said floor, as aforesaid, the said R. J. Ferguson would be permitted thereby to create a new and additional rentable room in said building above the store rooms then to be occupied by these plaintiffs; and the said lessor then and there further agreed as a further and a part consideration, and as an inducement to enter into said lease hereinbefore described between the plaintiffs and the said defendant R. J. Ferguson, to build and construct a new entrance to the said store rooms, with an attractive glass front and with tiled flooring at the entrance, and to put in new and additional side and end windows, thereby creating said building, whence said floor had been so lowered, into an attractive and desirable store room for the use of these plaintiffs. And as a further part of said agreement, agreed to cause to be constructed a sidewalk in front of said building and premises, and otherwise to so improve the same that they would present an attractive and inviting appearance.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe complaint did not set out a copy of the lease. The defendant, when he appeared in the action, moved the court to strike this paragraph from the complaint. When this motion was denied, defendant demurred, and when the demurrer was overruled, filed an answer setting up the lease, and denied all the facts as alleged in regard to a collateral, contemporaneous, oral agreement. WTien the case was on trial, the defendant objected to the testimony offered in support of the allegations of the complaint as quoted above. These objections were overruled, and the plaintiffs were permitted to testify to the facts substantially as alleged in the complaint. At the close of plaintiffs\\\\u2019 evidence, defendant moved to strike it and for a dismissal.\\\\nThe defendant contended below, and now urges here, that the facts alleged and testified to contradicted and varied the terms of the written lease and were therefore incompetent. The plaintiffs maintain that the evidence was admissible, because it tended to prove an oral, collateral, contemporaneous agreement. The rule is elementary that a written contract may not be varied or contradicted by parol. The rule is also well settled that parol evidence of collateral, oral agreements may be received where the parties have not, by their written contract, appeared to intend to reduce their entire negotiations to written form. Puget Sound Iron & Steel Works v. Clemmons, 32 Wash. 36, 72 Pac. 465; 1 Elliott, Evidence, \\\\u00a7 578. So that the main and controlling question here is, Was the alleged oral agreement a collateral one, or was it a part of the contract of lease. In Elliott on Evidence, \\\\u00a7 578, it is said:\\\\n\\\\u201cParol evidence of a distinct, valid, parol agreement between the parties, although prior to or contemporaneous with the written contract, is not excluded by the rule in question where it does not in any way vary or contradict the writing, and there are some cases in which this is true, although the parol agreement may be collateral to the written contract and relate in some way to the same subject-matter, at least where the writing is silent upon the subject and the parol agreement does not appear to be so closely connected with the matter of the written contract that it should be deemed to have entered into the negotiations or formed a part of the transactions or matter of which the writing was intended to be a complete and final statement. But a complete, valid, written contract merges all prior and contemporaneous negotiations and agreements within its purview, and if the parol agreement is not really collateral, but is an element of the written contract, or tends to vary or contradict the same, either in its express provisions or its legal import, it is inadmissible. The question usually is as to whether the parol evidence sought to be introduced contradicts or alters the written contract, or leaves it to stand unchanged and simply tends to establish an additional collateral agreement. It is often difficult to determine this question, and there is much conflict among the authorities.\\\\u201d\\\\nIn the next section, 579, the same author says:\\\\n\\\\u201cThere is also a class of cases in which it is held that oral evidence of a collateral contemporaneous- agreement which assumes the. contract as indicated by. the writing and undertakes to deal with some contingency, or new relation of the parties in the future that may arise under the written agreement, is admissible. It has also been held that parol evidence is admissible ... to show an agreement to destroy game, rebuild or repair as collateral to a lease, and to show an agreement by a vendor or lessor not to engage in a rival or competing business. But many of these decisions are of questionable soundness, and, as shown in the next section, the weight of authority is against some of them.\\\\u201d\\\\nAnd in the next section, 580, it is said:\\\\n\\\\u201cSo, contrary to decisions referred to in the preceding section, it has been held that a prior or contemporaneous parol agreement by a vendor or lessor not to carry on a competing business is inadmissible where the written contract appears to be complete. And so the better rule is that an oral warranty of the condition of the premises or agreement on the part of the lessor to make repairs .or improvements cannot be shown in such a case.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis appears to be the correct rule, and the one substantially followed by us in Gordon v. Parke & Lacy Mach. Co., 10 Wash. 18, 38 Pac. 755; Morris v. Healy Lumber Co., 46 Wash. 686, 91 Pac. 186, and Tobin v. McArthur, 56 Wash. 523, 106 Pac. 180. It is, therefore, not necessary for us to review the numerous cases which follow or deny the rule.\\\\nIt is conceded in this case that, after negotiations which led up to it, the lease in question was made. It bears upon its face evidence of careful preparation, and shows that the parties to it had considered the many questions in regard to the property; and upon the evidence introduced, it is not questioned that the parties discussed and considered the change in the street grades and its effect upon the property. The written lease provides: \\\\u201cThat said lessee hereby accepts said premises for the term of two years;\\\\u201d \\\\u201cthat said lessee agrees to pay any and all charges for heat,\\\\u201d \\\\u201cand agrees to make all necessary repairs of whatsoever nature to the interior of said premises;\\\\u201d \\\\u201cthat the said lessee shall not use said premises for saloon or restaurant purposes nor let or sub-let the whole or any part thereof nor make or permit to be made any changes or alterations whatsoever without the written consent of the lessor.\\\\u201d This appears to be a plain lease, where the lessor agreed to do nothing except to deliver possession of the premises to the lessee, who agreed to accept the premises as they then were, for a period of two years, and agreed to make all necessary repairs to the interior, and to make no changes or alterations to the building without the written consent of the lessor or his agents. Where there is no express agreement for the lessor to repair or alter the building, no such obligation will be implied. The duty devolves upon the lessee. 24 Cyc. 1081 et seq.; 18 Am. & Eng. Ency. Law (2d ed.), p. 226; Ward v. Hinkleman, 37 Wash. 375, 79 Pac. 956.\\\\nIf there was an agreement by the lessor prior to this writing, to change or repair the building during the term of the lease, that agreement was as much a part of the contract of lease as any other, and should have been incorporated in it. It was clearly not a collateral agreement under the rule first above stated. If tfye agreement was made as alleged and attempted to be proved, it was a part of the contract of lease, and it is strange that so important a matter should have been left out of the written agreement. As was said by Lord Ellenborough, in Powell v. Edmunds, 12 East 6, at page 10:\\\\n\\\\u201cIf the parol evidence were admissible in this case, I know\\' of no instance where a party may not. by parol testimony superadd any terms to a written agreement; which would be setting aside all written contracts and rendering them of no effect.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe trial court therefore erred in not sustaining the defendant\\\\u2019s objection to the evidence, and in refusing to dismiss the case upon the defendant\\\\u2019s motion.\\\\nThe judgment is therefore reversed, and the cause ordered dismissed.\\\\nDunbar, C.

Gjarde, by the terms of which Gjarde agreed to erect for the DeHoneys a building on a described tract of land, in the city of Seattle, to be used as a dancing academy. The contract provided that Gjarde should furnish all the necessary labor and materials and erect the building according to plans and specifications agreed upon between the parties,- prepared by one Svarz as architect. The contract price was $27,329, and the building was to be completed on or before 110 days from tbe date of tbe contract. Gjarde entered at once upon tbe performance of tbe work, completed it witbin tbe time fixed by tbe contract, and was paid tbe contract price.\\\\nDeHoney and wife took possession of tbe building sometime in August, 1923, and began to use it for tbe purposes for wbicb it was constructed. Tbe building gave no trouble during tbe dry weather wbicb followed tbe time possession was taken, but in tbe latter part of October, when tbe. rainy season began, water came into tbe ball of tbe building used for dancing in considerable quantities; so considerable, in fact, as to damage tbe furnishings and to cause tbe dancing floor to swell and buckle. The DeHoneys conceived that tbe water came into tbe room because of a defective and leaking roof, and called upon Gjarde to repair it. Some correspondence passed between them, resulting in a denial on tbe part of Gjarde of liability. Tbe DeHoneys caused tbe roof to be repaired by another person, and caused some additional ventilation to be installed in tbe building, whereupon water ceased to come into the room, and the walls thereof became dry soon thereafter.\\\\nTbe DeHoneys, as plaintiffs, thereafter began tbe present action to recover against Gjarde and bis bondsman, tbe Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland, in damages for tbe injuries caused by tbe water. They alleged that Gjarde failed to construct tbe building in accordance with tbe plans and specifications, in that be \\\\u201cnegligently and carelessly failed to turn up tbe felt and flashings onto the walls of said building not less than 18 inches as tbe contract and good workmanship required, but instead turned tbe same up not to exceed 12 inches in any place, and around tbe greater portion of tbe walls, not to exceed four inches, and negligently and carelessly failed to put tbe same up tight against said walls or to nail or otherwise fasten or cement the same at sufficiently close intervals, so that as a result the upper portions of the same were allowed to be loose and to bulge out from said walls, so that water could go- through where the same should have been fastened tight to the walls and from thence go down under the roofing and thence into the building; that where there were columns erected just inside said side walls, making numerous angles, the said felt and flashings were in some places pressed in so hard by them as to have cracked and broken the same, leaving openings for the water to go through, while in other places, they negligently and carelessly failed to press the same into- the angles sufficiently, but on the contrary allowed the same-to be loose and to bulge out at the top where it should have been tightly joined to the wall, so that the water could run down into the building as hereinbefore mentioned; that they negligently and carelessly allowed approximately 100 holes and openings to be and remain where the water could leak through, said holes and openings, for the most part being located where said felt and flashings should have been joined tight to the wall and columns, and where the same had been broken as hereinbefore mentioned, which were thereupon hidden by them by placing the counter flashings so as to conceal the same; that the top of said counter flashings was fastened by them to a wooden strip set in the concrete wall; that they negligently placed around said wooden strip certain plaster which was made out of poor material in that there was too much sand in the same, so that the same was so porous that it allowed the water to run through the same and back of said counter flashings and that much of said plastering material fell out after the same became water soaked; that the felt and flash-ings around the ventilators were not properly fastened by them, as hereinbefore stated, so- that the same were loose and bulged at the top, allowing the water to leak in; that the paper used by them on the slopes where the roof slopes steeply from the upper portion of the roof to the \\'valley\\\\u2019 portion of the roof below, was of poor quality, in that the same was checked and cracked; that the paper used by them on the roof and slopes was so put together by them that the same would leak at the joints and seams, the cause thereof not being known to plaintiffs; that along the south side of said building there were leaks under the windows; that they wholly failed to place any galvanized iron boxes in the comers, surrounding the drain pipes, but instead placed boxes made of cheap tin, none of which were securely soldered, so that the water leaked out of them, instead of going into the pipes; that no screens were placed in said boxes until after the first rains hereinafter mentioned, and on approximately the 17th day of November, 1923, thus allowing said pipes to become clogged; that by reason of the matters herein-above set forth, said building, when turned over to the plaintiffs on or about Aug. 29,1922, did not have a roof capable of turning water during an ordinary rain, but on the contrary said roof was in such condition as to be leaky in wet weather, none of which defects were discovered by plaintiffs or known to them until the rains hereinafter mentioned occurred.\\\\u201d\\\\nDamages were claimed in the following sums for the following items:\\\\nRepairing roof ........................... $541.35\\\\nCarpenter work .......................... 400.30\\\\nRedecorating the walls and work on damaged paintings ............................. 403.65\\\\nPlumbing work........................... 25.47\\\\nTinning.................................. 5.25\\\\nResurfacing the dancing floor.............. 600.00\\\\nRedecorating the walls and ceiling.......... 1,500.00\\\\nAdditional work on paintings.............. 600.00\\\\nDamage to seats.......................... 800.00\\\\nDamage to piano...................\\\\u2022...... 500.00\\\\nDamage to curtains....................... 300.00\\\\nDepreciation of building (Not repairable).. .10,000.00\\\\nLoss of profits because of non-usability of building ..............................25,000.00\\\\nThe first five of the items of damage were for money actually expended for the work therein indicated. Other items, in so far as they relate to work, were the estimates of witnesses of the reasonable cost of performance. The remaining items are self-explanatory. After issue had been joined on the complaint, a trial was entered upon before a jury. During the course of the trial the court withdrew from the consideration of the jury the item of damage relating to loss of profits. The jury, on the remaining items, returned a general verdict for the plaintiffs in the sum of $14,500.25. Within due time, the defendants moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or, in the alternative, for a new trial. The court denied the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, but entered an order to the effect that it would grant the motion for a new trial unless within twenty days thereafter the plaintiffs would in writing remit from the amount of the verdict the sum of $10,000; further ordering that, in case such remission be made, the plaintiffs have judgment for the amount of the remainder of the verdict. The remission was filed within the required time, and thereupon judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiffs for the sum of $4,500.25.\\\\nThe plaintiffs also moved for a new trial on the question of damages for loss of profits, which motion the court denied. Both parties appeal; the defendants from the judgment entered, and the plaintiffs from the order of the court refusing them a new trial on the question of the loss of profits.\\\\nTaking up the appeal of the defendants, they first assign error on the ruling of the court denying them a new trial. Under this head they present a number of questions, the first being that the verdict was the result of passion and prejudice on the part of the jury. It is said that this is evidenced (1) by the amount of the verdict, (2) because the verdict is contrary to the evidence, and (3) because the trial court so found. Noticing these in their order, of the first it can be said that the verdict was well within the testimony introduced on the part of the plaintiffs. The total sum claimed by the plaintiffs, and which their evidence tended to prove, omitting the claim of $25,000 for loss of profits which the court took from the jury, was $15,676.02. The general verdict of the jury was for $14,500.25. Manifestly, it seems to- us this is not so close an approximation to the plaintiffs\\\\u2019 claims as to furnish conclusive proofs that the jury gave the evidence no consideration, but followed blindly the plaintiffs \\\\u2019 testimony.\\\\nNor did the question of the amount of damages suffered rest upon the testimony of the plaintiffs alone. They were supported by competent disinterested witnesses, some of whom had made estimates with a view of repairing the damages. Nor was the item of depreciation without evidence in its support. In addition to the estimates, a witness who had been engaged in building construction for twenty-three years testified that in his judgment the building was depreciated in value by the flooding to which it had been subjected in the sum of $10,000. The amount of the depreciation is, of course, of no moment on the present appeal, since the plaintiffs consented to waive their claim thereto rather than submit to a new trial. It is mentioned to repel the inference which might otherwise be thought to obtain, that the jury returned a verdict for a claim unsupported by evidence. True, there are affidavits of certain jurors to the effect that some of the items of damage were allowed in full and others disallowed, but conceding that jurors may thus explain their verdict after their discharge, there is nothing in the fact which so far impeaches it as to require the court to say that it was the result of passion and prejudice. Moreover, we do not find\\' in the record that the estimates of the plaintiffs \\\\u2019 witnesses were disputed by the other side. There was a leakage from the roof at one time for which the defendants admitted fault, and they offered testimony to the effect that the damage caused thereby did not exceed $50, but on the general question of the amount of damages, the cause went to the jury on the testimony of the plaintiffs \\\\u2019 witnesses. It would seem that, under these circumstances, the court could hardly find either passion or prejudice had the verdict been for the full amount demanded.\\\\nThe second contention under this head is that the overwhelming weight of the evidence relating to the cause of the damage is against the verdict of the jury. It is first argued that the building was constructed according to the plans and specifications, and if it was so constructed as not to furnish protection against leaks in the roof, it was the fault of the plaintiffs who furnished the plans and specifications, and not the fault of the builder. To an understanding of this argument some notice must be taken of the plans and specifications. The building was in size 72 feet by 128 feet. It was a one-story building with the ceiling 18 feet above the floor. The walls were of six-inch reinforced concrete. The roof was for the greater part comparatively flat, breaking down at rather a sharp angle as the walls were approached, forming a valley or gutter along the walls. The frame work was of wood construction covered over with sheathing hoards. Over the sheathing boards was laid a dry sheet of felt, and over this four layers of felt glued together with roofing cement. On top of this was poured a coating of asphalt onto which gravel was spread. The construction of the slopes was the same as the main part of the roof, except that the gravel was omitted and in its stead was placed an additional thickness of 3-ply Lastile roofing, called a finishing sheet. The plans required the felt to reach across the valley formed by the junction of the roof and the wall, and to extend up the wall for a distance of 18 inches. This extension is called in the record the base-flashing. It was to be well pressed into angles of the wall, reinforced with a strip of felt eight inches wide, cemented solidly in place, and covered by a counter-flashing \\\\u2014 a strip of galvanized iron fastened into the wall and bent over the base-flashing. The counter-flashing was fastened to a reglet placed in the wall at the time the concrete was poured. The valleys or gutters were constructed with a slope or pitch towards the comers of the building wherein were placed outlet boxes with pipes leading to the city sewers, furnishing an escape for water falling on the roof.\\\\nBy some miscalculation the reglets were not placed high enough in the walls of the building to permit the base-flashing to extend up the walls for the distance called for by the plans and specifications \\\\u2014 the actual distance, instead of being eighteen inches as the plans required, was twelve inches at the highest place, ranging from that distance down to four inches at the lowest. It was the testimony of plaintiffs and their witnesses that the base-flashings were not cemented to the wall and that water falling on the roof and flowing into the valley would rise higher than the base-flashing, pass under the counter-flashing and flow down between the base-flashing and the wall of the building and come out into the main dancing hall. The evidence on the part of the defendants, on the other hand, was to the effect that there was no leaking in this manner, that the water that was found in the dancing room was the result of condensation, caused by the crowds that gathered in the room and insufficient ventilation. The evidence on these discordant views it would serve no useful purpose to review. As we read the record, the evidence preponderates on the side of the plaintiffs. At the least, there was substantial evidence supporting the view of the plaintiffs sufficient to warrant the jury in so finding without subjecting them to the charge of being controlled by the undue influence of passion and prejudice.\\\\nThe third ground assigned for the conclusion that the jury were influenced by passion and prejudice in rendering their verdict, we think, is also without foundation. The matter arose out of the argument of one of the plaintiffs\\\\u2019 counsel to the jury. It appears in the record by affidavits filed by the defendants in support of their motion for a new trial, and opposing affidavits by the other side, no stenographic report of the argument being taken. In the defendants\\\\u2019 affidavits counsel for the plaintiffs is accused of stating to the jury that the court in its rulings and conduct unduly favored the defendants; the more precise charge being that counsel stated to the jury that in his cross examination of one of the defendants\\\\u2019 witnesses he had the witness \\\\u201ccornered,\\\\u201d and that the court came to his relief by calling a recess, giving the witness an opportunity to collect his thoughts. In the opposing affidavits it is admitted that counsel said something in the nature of the remark cited to* the jury, but he denies that his language was capable of the interpretation put upon it by the defendants, that he expressly disclaimed at the time that he was charging the court with unfairness, and stated expressly that the recess was called because the usual time therefor had arrived. * In passing upon the motion for a new trial, the court stated that he thought the remark was very unfortunate, and that it \\\\u201cmust have had some effect upon the jury\\\\u201d; further stating that ordinarily remarks of this sort \\\\u201creact on the person making the remark, but it is evident in this case it did not, in view of the verdict that was returned.\\\\u201d\\\\nIt is from these statements of the court that the defendants draw the conclusion that the court found that the jury\\\\u2019s verdict was the result of passion and prejudice. But we cannot draw therefrom a like conclusion. The court\\\\u2019s very ruling on the motion is conclusive to the contrary. The trial judge is distinguished and experienced. He has long presided on the trial bench, and it is unthinkable that his sense of justice would permit him to let the verdict stand if he was of the belief that it was founded on something other than the evidence in the cause. It is our feeling that much is here made of little. At the time of the argument, the remark was not regarded as of sufficient moment to require notice either by the trial judge or by the opposing counsel. Manifestly, if it was then thought that it contained the sinister charge now imputed to it, it would not have gone unchallenged.\\\\nIt is further argued in this connection that the remarks imputed to counsel require a reversal in any event, regardless of the question of passion or prejudice. But we think we need not pursue the inquiry further than to add that in this aspect it is not sufficiently before the court for review. No objection to the remark was made at the time of its utterance. The rule is that improper argument of counsel cannot be successfully assigned as error unless there has been a request to the court to correct it by instructing the jury to disregard it, or unless the misconduct is so flagrant as to be incapable of cure by instruction. Canfield v. Seattle Cornice Works, 122 Wash. 318, 210 Pac. 773; Vanderveer v. Hillman, 122 Wash. 684, 211 Pac. 722. In our view, there was nothing in the remark here incapable of cure by instructions.\\\\nThe next contention is that, if the damage to the building was the fault of a leaking roof, it was due to defects in the design of the building and not due to the fault of the contractor. To an understanding of the objection some further description of the manner in which the roof was constructed is necessary. Where the roof supports joined the wall of the building, a valley was left by the mode of construction required of some eight or nine inches wide only. The plans required a galvanized iron drain box twelve inches wide to be inserted in the valley to facilitate the flow of water to the outlet pipes located at the comers of the building, and further required that the drain should have a slope. A drain box twelve inches wide would not thus rest on the top of the supporting beams, or closer thereto than some four or more inches. In making the measurements for the insertion in the wall of the reglets at the time of its construction, no allowance was made either for this elevation or for the slope of the box, and apparently there were other things which raised the bottom of the valley for which no allowance was made. As the position of the reglets measured the height of the base-flashings, the result was that the flashings did not extend eighteen inches above the bottom of the valley.\\\\nIt is claimed that the scale drawings of the architect showing the position in the wall at which the reglets were to be inserted made no allowance for these differences, and that there was thus a conflict between the plans and specifications and the scale drawings, and that the builder was justified in following the scale drawings. It is further contended that the architect, who was empowered by the building contract to reconcile conflicts that might exist between the plans, specifications and drawings, had his attention called to this discrepancy at the time it was discovered, and that he not only approved the work at that time, but also subsequently accepted the completed work as a compliance with the contract. But we cannot accept these conclusions. As we view the drawings, it required some rather delicate measurements to determine the position of the reglets in the wall from the drawings alone, and that error could easily occur by relying upon such measurements. But the rule is that plans, specifications and drawings for a building must be construed as a whole, and plainly, nothing more than a casual examination of the whole would at once disclose that measurements from the top of the roof beams would not permit the insertion of the base-flash-ings to the height required by the plans and specifications. Nor do we think that the approval of the architect bound the owners. At the time of the acceptance and final payment, they were ignorant of this failure to follow the plans and specifications, and we find this clause in the contract:\\\\n\\\\u201cNo payments or certificate, final or otherwise, shall be construed to relieve the contractor from his obligation to make good any defects arising or discovered in his work within six months after the completion and acceptance of the same.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe discovery of the defect was made within the six months\\\\u2019 period, and within that time a demand was made upon the builder to repair it, with which demand there was no compliance.\\\\nThe specifications provided:\\\\n\\\\u201cThe roofing contractor shall give a satisfactory written guarantee on the roof, guaranteeing same for the period of ten years against leaks, and keeping the same in repair during the ten years.\\\\u201d\\\\nAs a compliance with this clause of the specifications the builder procured a letter from the corporation to whom he had let a subcontract for installing the roof, in which the subcontractor agreed to maintain the roofing installed by them for a period of ten years. The recited conditions were:\\\\n\\\\u201cThis agreement relates only to the material and workmanship furnished by us, and will be fulfilled by repairing free of charge any leaks resulting\\\\u2019 from defects in such material or workmanship. This maintenance agreement is issued to Peder P. Gjarde of Seattle, Wash., and refers to approximately lOb^ squares of roofing completed on the 5th day of June, 1922, on a building located on Lot 12 and south 20 feet of Lot 11, Block 11, Nagles Addition to the City of Seattle, known as the DeHoney Dancing Academy building.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis letter was forwarded to the plaintiffs and retained by them. The defendants requested the court to charge the jury that the \\\\u201cletter constituted a sufficient and satisfactory guarantee and complied with the terms of the specifications,\\\\u201d and that \\\\u201cthe liability of the defendants in this case is limited to the fair and reasonable costs in putting the roof in satisfactory condition, if you find that it was leaky or defective, . . . and you cannot award\\\\u201d the plaintiffs \\\\u201cdamages for any injuries to their building, its floors, walls or contents.\\\\u201d The court declined to give the instruction and error is assigned thereon. Were this an action based upon the special warranty set forth, possibly the rule for which the defendants contend might be applicable. But this is not such an action. It is an action based upon the building contract as an entirety, of which this warranty is only a part. The question is not, therefore, was there a breach of the warranty, but is rather, was there a breach of the building contract. In such an action the measure of damages is the amount of damages which naturally result or flow from the breach complained of, and which were contemplated by the parties as a probable consequence of the breach. School District No. 172 v. Josenhans, 88 Wash. 624, 153 Pac. 326. There can, we think, be no question that a breach of that part of the contract relating to the construction of the roof, if the breach was of such a nature as to cause it to leak water in quantities such as was shown here, would materially damage the interior of the building as well as the contents of the building. There can, therefore, be a recovery of the damages ensuing from the breach, re.gardless of the terms of the special contract to keep the roof in repair.\\\\nThe sixth assignment of error relates to the evidence introduced to show a loss of profits. It will be remembered that the court, during the course of the trial, withdrew this item of damage from the consideration of the jury and instructed the jury not to consider the evidence relating thereto. At this stage of the proceedings the plaintiffs had introduced a considerable part of their evidence on the subject, and it is contended that, notwithstanding the withdrawal of the item from the consideration of the jury and the instruction given, the prejudicial effect of the evidence was not thereby cured. But we see nothing unusual in this circumstance. In the trial of causes it frequently happens that the court must, from the nature of the case, admit evidence on subjects which he must afterwards withdraw from the consideration of the jury, aud if this must in every case require the trial court to discharge the jury then empaneled and commence over again, \\\\u201cthere will,\\\\u201d as we said in Bayers v. Barry, 114 Wash. 252, 194 Pac. 993, \\\\u201cbe no end to law suits.\\\\u201d But the rule is not thus stringent. In the early case of Lyts v. Keevey, 5 Wash. 606, 32 Pac. 534, we said we were not disposed to adopt the rule that evidence improperly admitted cannot be counteracted in the subsequent course of the trial by instructions withdrawing its consideration from the jury. This rule we have followed in many subsequent cases. See: Wilson v. West & Slade Mill Co., 28 Wash. 312, 68 Pac. 716; Yakima Valley Bank v. McAllister, 37 Wash. 566, 79 Pac. 1119, 107 Am. St. 823, 1 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1075; Billings v. Snohomish, 51 Wash. 135, 98 Pac. 107; and the cases collected in the cited cases.\\\\nIn State v. Gay, 82 Wash. 423, 144 Pac. 711, concerning this question, we said:\\\\n\\\\u201cBut it is contended that the evidence was so far prejudicial as to be incapable of cure by its withdrawal from.the consideration of the jury. To this point, the appellant cites State v. Pryor, 67 Wash. 216, 121 Pac. 56. That case, however, was an extreme case. The evidence admitted and subsequently withdrawn had reference to offenses degrading in their nature, in no way connected with the offense upon which the appellant was being prosecuted, and was withdrawn only on condition that the defendant would admit a fact necessary to be shown in order to convict him of the offense with which he was charged. Under these circumstances, the court could well conclude that the act of the court did not remove the prejudice occasioned by the admission of the improper evidence. But it was not \\'therein intended to be held that no error in the admission of improper testimony can be cured by such means, and especially was it not meant to be held that evidence, not objectionable in itself, but improperly admitted because of a circumstance not shown when the testimony was offered, cannot be cured by withdrawing it from the consideration of the jury. The presumption in all cases is that the jury obeyed the instructions of the court, and this presumption must prevail until it is overcome by some showing that the fact is otherwise. To withdraw evidence subsequently discovered to be improperly admitted is a common practice in criminal as well as in civil causes, and the procedure is generally held to cure any error caused by its improper admission. State v. Manville, 8 Wash. 523, 36 Pac. 470; Yakima Valley Bank v. McAllister, 37 Wash. 566, 79 Pac. 1119, 107 Am. St. 823, 1 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1075. We think in the present case any error committed by the admission of the testimony objected to was cured by its subsequent withdrawal.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis court has held, it is true, in cases other than the case referred to in the last cited case, that, there are circumstances where the prejudicial effect of improper evidence is not removed by instructions to disregard it, but it will be found from an examination of the cases that they present circumstances differentiating them from the general rule, matters not present in the case now before us.\\\\nThe account book of the plaintiffs showing their receipts and disbursements in the operation of the building prior to and during the time the leakage from the roof occurred, was admitted in evidence as tending to prove loss of profits. When this item of damage was withdrawn from the jury the book as evidence was also stricken. By some inadvertence, however, it was sent to the jury room along with the exhibits in the cause. The affidavits of the jurors submitted show that the book was not examined by the jurors until after they had agreed upon a verdict, when some member of the jury read certain items therefrom. As the book related to matters which the court had instructed them were not for their consideration, it is difficult to see wherein it could have a prejudicial effect even-had it been examined by the jury. But conceding that prejudice under that circumstance might he presumed, the fact shown precludes error. The rule is thus stated in Thompson on Trials, \\\\u00a7 2590:\\\\n\\\\u201cIf the paper was taken out by mistake, and not by the fraud or design of the prevailing party, or his counsel, and if it was not in fact read by the jury, then there is no occasion to grant a new trial; since no harm has been done to the party against whom the verdict was rendered, and the other party has done no wrong for which he is to be punished. And the rule is the same where it is made to appear that the only jurors who read the objectionable paper had already agreed to return the verdict which was rendered. As the affidavits of jurors are generally admissible to sustain their verdicts, it may be shown by such evidence that the paper was not in fact read by any of the jury.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\u25a0 Here the book went to the jury by mistake, and not by fraud or design of the prevailing parties or their counsel. Nor was it considered by the jury. Hence, in the language of the authority cited, \\\\u201cno harm has been done to the party against whom the verdict was rendered. \\\\u2019 \\\\u2019\\\\nThe plaintiffs\\\\u2019 witness Kubat was permitted, over the objection of the defendants, to testify to the damage to a piano in the building caused by moisture. The objection was based on the ground that he had not shown sufficient qualifications. Frbm his testimony it appears that he had had twenty years\\\\u2019 experience as a piano tuner, that he had been in the wholesale and retail trade of pianos for fifteen years, that he was familiar with prices of pianos in Seattle, and had done much work on the piano in question. At the time he was testifying he could not recall the make of the piano, but testified that it was a baby grand, a brand new instrument, and that the damage was to the strings, the pads, and the sounding board; the latter injury causing the principal damage. In our opinion, he was qualified to testify. The weight to be given to his testimony was, of course, for the jury, but its admission neither requires a reversal nor the deduction of this item of damage from the amount of the verdict.\\\\nCertain witnesses were called by the plaintiffs on rebuttal, and it is objected that their testimony is not proper rebuttal. These objections we shall not notice in detail, as we can see no such prejudice as would require a reversal, even were the objections well taken. But, more than this, we cannot conclude that the objections are well taken.\\\\nThe remaining assignments relate to the instructions of the court to the jury. There were requests for instructions which the trial court refused to give, and there were instructions to which the defendants excepted. In the main, they involve the question of the proper construction of the contract. These in part we have hereinbefore adverted, in which we have declined to follow the construction of the defendants, and have followed that of the trial court. These require no further discussion. Those not heretofore involved will be briefly noticed. The defendants requested the following instruction:\\\\n\\\\u201cI instruct you that by the express terms of the contract in evidence in this case, the architect, Louis Svarz, was the agent of the owner, J. H. DeHoney, and as such had authority to represent and bind the owner by all of his directions and orders to the defendant Gjarde.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe court, on the subject-matter, gave the following:\\\\n\\\\u201cI instruct you that by the express terms of the contract in evidence in this case, the architect, Louis Svarz, was the agent of the owner, J. H. DeHoney, and as such had authority to represent and bind the owner by all of his directions and orders to the defendant Gjarde\\', in so far as the quality of the materials-and workmanship were concerned, but not as to any material deviation from the plans and specifications.\\\\n\\\\u201cYou are instructed that it is provided in said contract and specifications that no alterations shall be made in the work shown or described by drawings and specifications, except upon the written order of the architect; that no deviation from the drawings or specifications shall be made in the execution of the work without the written approval of the architect; that no verbal statement of any person whomsoever shall be allowed in any manner or degree to modify or otherwise affect the terms of the contract of specifications, and that changes shall be made only and strictly according to contract.\\\\u201d\\\\nIn its instructions the court but followed the provisions of the contract. There was elsewhere in the contract, it is true, recitals to the effect that the architect was the agent of the owner, and that his interpretation of the contract should be final, but these provisions referred to instances of repugnant provisions of the contract, or to instances where the contract did not speak; it gave the architect no- power to- modify provisions capable of but one interpretation. As we said in Dyer v. Middle Kittitas Irr. Dist., 40 Wash. 238, 82 Pac. 301:\\\\n\\\\u201cThe contract provides that the engineer shall define the meaning, intent, and purport of the plans and specifications, and that his decision in all cases shall be final; but this, it is plain, refers to the interpretation of doubtful and uncertain terms of the contract, not to the question of law presented by the language of the contract or specifications. This clause does not confer upon the engineer the power to vary the meaning of plain terms used in the contract, for if this were so, there would be no need of the writing, as the engineer\\\\u2019s arbitrary assertion would be all-sufficient.\\\\u201d\\\\nSee, also: Hurley v. Kiona-Benton School Dist., No. 27, 124 Wash. 537, 215 Pac. 21; Mercantile Trust Co. v. Hensey, 205 U. S. 298.\\\\nThe trial court further on in its instructions quoted certain of the provisions of the contract relating to the manner of constructing the roof, and instructed the jury that even though they should find that the defendant Grjarde had the roofing work done by a subcontractor, he would nevertheless be under obligation to see that there was no deviation from the contract. The defendant objects to this for the reason that it amounted to an instruction that the defendant was obligated \\\\u201cto see that the base flashing was turned up 18 inches, which was the pivot of the whole case.\\\\u201d \\\\u2022 In our opinion, the instruction was correct, even though it be so construed. As we have before indicated, the fact being admitted that there was not a compliance with the contract with reference to the construction of the roof in the respect stated, it followed as matter of law that there was a breach of the contract, for which the defendant was liable in damages for the injury that arose from the breach. Error, therefore, cannot be predicated on an instruction so stating.\\\\nTurning to the plaintiffs\\\\u2019 appeal, we find no error in the ruling of the court withdrawing from the consideration of the jury the question of loss of profits. True, this court is committed to the rule that loss of profits may be recovered, but we have said that the loss must be shown with a reasonable degree of accuracy, and that the testimony establishing the loss must be clear and free from taint of speculation or conjecture. Kohne v. White, 12 Wash. 199, 40 Pac. 794; Purcell v. Warburton, 70 Wash. 129, 126 Pac. 89; Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co., 102 Wash. 423, 172 Pac. 47; Brinnon Logging Co. v. Carlsborg M. & T. Co., 122 Wash. 483, 210 Pac. 945; Schermerhorn v. Sayles, 123 Wash. 139, 212 Pac. 156.\\\\nThe cases cited and the cases referred to in the citations illustrate the rule as we have applied it, and the principle involved requires no further elucidation. The evidence introduced shows that any verdict rendered thereon must, as to its amount, be speculative and conjectural, and we conclude that it was properly withdrawn from the consideration of the jury.\\\\nOur conclusion is that the judgment must be affirmed on both appeals, and it is so ordered. Neither appellant will recover costs in this court.\\\\nHolcomb, Main, Mitchell, and Mackintosh, JJ., concur.\",\"type\":\"majority\",\"author\":\"Fullerton, J.\"}],\"attorneys\":[\"Tucker, Hyland & Elvidge and Mary H.

It is unmeandered, which means that in the original federal government survey the surveyors did not locate the shoreline, but merely ran the government section lines across the lake. As a result many shoreline property owners also own subdivided portions of the lake bed. The lake is surrounded principally by single residences, together with a few multiple residences, a public school ground, and a small city park. Residents of the area have long used the entire lake surface for recreational activities.\\\\nThe plaintiffs are 24 property owners who own upland abutting the lake and, in some instances, parts of the lake bed, or who otherwise have access rights to the lake by reason of an easement to the lake shore. Defendants own a parcel of land abutting on the east side of the lake at the south end, about two-thirds of which is upland and one-third lake bed. Title is traced to an 1872 federal government patent, which made no reference to the lake.\\\\nThe south end of the lake, including defendants\\\\u2019 property, has been business zoned for many years, and was formerly operated as Playland Amusement Park. The property is currently zoned commercial general (CG) by the city of Seattle. In zoning the land around the lake the city ran its zoning lines across the lake surface so that the entire lake bed is zoned. Defendants\\\\u2019 submerged land is zoned commercial general, while other portions of the lake bed are zoned residential.\\\\nIn August, 1966 defendants purchased the property in question, after having procured preliminary architectural plans for the construction of four apartment buildings. Apartment buildings Nos. 1 and 2 were to be constructed partly on the upland, but would extend approximately 130 feet out into the lake, supported on two finger-like piers secured by cement pilings. Apartments Nos. 3 and 4 were to be constructed entirely on the upland abutting the lake. Mortgage commitments were obtained based on these plans, and on June 12, 1967, a building permit was issued by the city of Seattle.\\\\nOn June 5, 1967, excavation of the upland was commenced and on June 8 or 9 dirt was first pushed into the lake about 25 feet in order to form a base or pad. Some of the plaintiffs immediately protested to defendants and began making an investigation to determine the extent of defendants\\\\u2019 construction plans. The protests went unheeded so plaintiffs on July 5, 1967, brought an action to enjoin defendants from filling or building over the surface of the lake. In conjunction with that action they posted a $1,000 bond and obtained an exparte temporary order restraining the defendants from interfering with the surface area and shoreline of Bitter Lake.\\\\nThe motion for a temporary injunction was heard on July 15, 1967, by a different department of the superior court than that which later heard the case on the merits. The court denied the motion but delayed the effective date of the order so that plaintiffs might petition this court for a writ of review. On July 20, 1967, that petition was denied by this court on procedural grounds. It was understood at the time that the ruling did not reach the merits of the petition.\\\\nOn July 21, 1967, the temporary restraining order was dissolved. Plaintiffs then made every effort to get the case to trial and in fact secured a substantially earlier trial date than would have been possible through the normal progression of the trial docket in King County. Trial was commenced on October. 10, 1967.\\\\nPending the trial on the merits, defendants proceeded as rapidly as possible with the construction of apartment No. 1 and the concrete slab to support it. The slab projects out into the lake approximately 130 feet and is 77 feet wide. Beneath it the lake is filled with dirt, and pilings of steel beams are used to support it. The slab will be 1.18 feet above high water and 6.18 feet above low water. The apartment constructed on the slab will be three stories in height. At the time of trial it was planned that both apartments Nos. 1 and 2 would extend out over the water. However, in oral argument in this court defendants stated that the plans for apartment No. 2 had been modified so that it would be constructed entirely on upland.\\\\nThe trial court determined that defendants had no right to build out into Bitter Lake, and enjoined them from further construction over the surface of the lake. In addition, defendants were ordered to remove the existing structure and earth fill, which had been put there during the period prior to the trial.\\\\nDefendants\\\\u2019 12 assignments of error are directed to (1) the trial court\\\\u2019s determination that defendants had no right to build out into Bitter Lake, (2) the remedy granted in view of hardship caused to defendants relative to hardship plaintiffs would suffer if the mandatory injunction were denied, (3) prejudice of the trial judge in view of his personal experience as attorney in a prior case which dealt with surface rights of lake shore owners, (4) the trial court\\\\u2019s findings that defendants disregarded protests of plaintiffs and the pendency of this suit, and its failure to include a specific finding on defendants\\\\u2019 good faith, and (5) the trial court\\\\u2019s failure to find adverse possession of the area in question by defendants\\\\u2019 predecessor in title.\\\\nIn the challenge to the trial court\\\\u2019s determination that defendants had no right to build out into Bitter Lake, defendants emphasize the effect of the commercial zoning imposed on their property. Defendants contend that their apartment is a riparian use, and that reasonableness is the test for its permissibility. They further contend that reasonableness in this case is a legislative determination expressed in the city zoning ordinance. In other words, the Seattle City Council, by conferring a commercial general zoning classification on this property, and issuing a building permit, determined that an apartment is a reasonable and proper use of this tract, which includes lake bed property.\\\\nRiparian rights and privileges are conferred upon a property owner by virtue of the contiguity of his property to a body of water. Mayer v. Grueber, 29 Wis. 2d 168, 138 N.W.2d 197 (1965). Although we have never promulgated an all-inclusive definition of riparian rights, we have previously recognized as riparian rights on nonnavigable lakes the rights of swimming, fishing, boating, and bathing. Snively v. Jaber, 48 Wn.2d 815, 296 P.2d 1015, 57 A.L.R.2d 560 (1956). Further, these rights have been characterized as vested property interests, included in the protection afforded by Const, art. 1 \\\\u00a7 16, which provides that private property shall not be taken or damaged for public or private use without just compensation. In re Clinton Water Dist., 36 Wn.2d 284, 218 P.2d 309 (1950).\\\\nWe cannot agree that defendants\\\\u2019 apartment constructed over water constitutes a riparian use, or that its permissibility comes within a rule of reasonableness as determined by the Seattle zoning authorities.\\\\nMere proximity of the apartment to the water does not render it a riparian use. With respect to a structure, such a use must be so intimately associated with the water that apart from the water its utility would be seriously impaired. This is not the case with defendants\\\\u2019 prospective use. The utility of the apartment is in no way dependent upon the waters of Bitter Lake, and its utility as an apartment would be in no way impaired apart from this lake. This is evidenced by the fact that apartments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 are entirely on upland property.\\\\nNor may defendants justify the presence of their apartment by the commercial zoning classification imposed by the city of Seattle or by the issuance of a building permit.\\\\nAll riparian owners along the shore of a natural, nonnavigable lake share in common the right to use the entire surface of the lake for boating, swimming, fishing, and other similar riparian rights so long as there is no unreasonable interference with the exercise of these rights by other respective owners. Snively v. Jaber, supra; Botton v. State, 69 Wn.2d 751, 420 P.2d 352 (1966) , These rights are vested property rights, and may not be taken or damaged for public or private use without just compensation. In re Clinton Water Dist., supra. It follows, therefore, that while the city of Seattle might regulate the exercise of these rights by means of its police power, it may not totally divest plaintiffs of them through the mechanisms of zoning. Indeed, the effect of this case, if we were to follow defendants\\\\u2019 reasoning, would be to divest plaintiffs of valuable property rights for the private use and benefit of defendants. Such a result is clearly contrary to the law, and we are certain was not intended by the Seattle zoning authorities when the commercial general classification was placed on defendants\\\\u2019 property.\\\\nDefendants next assert error in the trial court\\\\u2019s choice of remedy, in that defendants were required to remove the structure it placed out over the surface of the lake. It must be noted, in response to this assertion, that since we have determined that defendants\\\\u2019 apartment does not constitute a riparian use, it becomes in effect an encroachment upon plaintiffs\\\\u2019 common rights to use this portion of the lake surface for purposes of riparian enjoyment. In view of this, it is defendants\\\\u2019 contention that nonetheless, an application of the doctrine of relative hardship, or balancing the equities, requires that they not be enjoined to remove the existing structure now in place. Although it is not clear from the evidence, the amount of loss might be substantial that defendants could suffer if unable to complete apartment No. 1. Estimates by the plaintiffs based on defendants\\\\u2019 figures fix the maximum possible loss at approximately $100,000. Defendants on the other hand contend they will lose in excess of $250,000. The evidence indicates, however, that when it became apparent that defendants faced a lawsuit to halt construction of apartment No. 1 with the ever existing possibility that they might lose, they took no action to mitigate their potential loss by attempting to renegotiate or cancel the construction contracts or other financial commitments. At that time only a small proportion of the total financial commitment had actually been expended and the remaining potential loss depended on the binding effect of the commitments, most of which were oral in nature, the rigidity of the other contracting parties position, and the feasibility of altering construction plans.\\\\nFrom the very commencement of defendants\\\\u2019 construction they were aware of the protests of other riparian owners. The encroaching structure did not exist at the time of suit, but was built during the pendency of this suit. Defendant contractor, Mr. Ray Lotto, testified that after the temporary restraining order was dissolved \\\\u201cwe proceeded as fast as we could, because, at that time, we already lost two weeks.\\\\u201d\\\\nThus, defendants proceeded to construct the apartment in question with full knowledge that their right to do so was contested and that there was a real likelihood, in view of our holding in Snively v. Jaber, supra, that the case on the merits would be decided against them. In addition, the court in its oral opinion dissolving the temporary restraining order, pointed out that the case was going to be appealed, would be a landmark case, and the Supreme Court might look at it differently. During oral arguments defendants\\\\u2019 counsel admitted that they knowingly took a risk by continuing construction while the case was pending on the merits, and indeed, there is no other possible interpretation of defendants\\\\u2019 conduct. Their explanation was that although not much construction had been done on apartment No. 1 they were already financially committed to the entire project and felt they had to take the risk.\\\\nThe benefit of the doctrine of balancing the equities, or relative hardship, is reserved for the innocent defendant who proceeds without knowledge or warning that his structure encroaches upon another\\\\u2019s property or property rights. City of Dunsmuir v. Silva, 154 Cal. App. 2d 825, 317 P.2d 653 (1957); Winthers v. Bertrand, 239 Ore. 97, 396 P.2d 570 (1964). Under the circumstances of this case, defendants are not entitled to evoke the benefit of this doctrine.\\\\nDefendants next assert that the bias of the trial judge prevented them from having a fair trial. This assignment is based on the prior experience of the trial judge as counsel for Dr. J. Howard Snively, who was subsequently a party in Snively v. Jaber, supra. Although the trial judge did not represent Dr. Snively in that suit, he did offer legal advice to him. Defendants argue that that experience prejudiced the judge\\\\u2019s views on the issue of defendants\\\\u2019 good faith and caused him to prejudge the case even before the trial started.\\\\nRCW 4.12.040 provides in part:\\\\nNo judge of a superior court of the state of Washington shall sit to hear or try any action or proceeding when it shall be established as hereinafter provided that said judge is prejudiced against any party or attorney, or the interest of any party or attorney appearing in such cause.\\\\nClearly, defendants show no prejudice which comes within the requirements of this statute. Merely because a judge has had occasion to study a point of law and offer advice based on his interpretation of it is no grounds for disqualification. This assignment is without merit. \\'\\\\nDefendants charge error in the trial court\\\\u2019s refusal to find that defendants\\\\u2019 predecessor in interest, Playland Amusement Park, established the exclusive right to use the disputed portion of the lake by adverse possession. We find no merit to this contention in light of testimony of a former park policeman that his intentions were only to prevent persons from entering the park without paying the entrance fee. There was no evidence that other riparian owners were ever prevented from using the entire surface of the lake, or that the operators of Playland Amusement Park ever intended to assert any proprietary rights over portions of the surface abutting its shore. Indeed, certain residents of Bitter Lake testified that they had always used the entire surface of the lake, including portions over the area owned by defendants, even while Playland was in operation. In any event, it was a disputed question of fact and as there was substantial evidence to support the finding of the trial court, it will not be disturbed on appeal. State ex rel. Carroll v. Seattle Hotel Bldg. Corp., 41 Wn.2d 595, 250 P.2d 982 (1952).\\\\nDefendants next assign error to the trial court\\\\u2019s refusal to grant a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. The evidence was the testimony of a daughter of defendants\\\\u2019 predecessor in interest and related to the question of adverse use of that portion of the lake in dispute. The substance of her testimony was before the trial judge by way of affidavit in support of the motion. It was to some extent cumulative in nature, and we do not feel that the court abused its discretion in denying the motion.\\\\nDefendants finally argue that under Hughes v. Washington, 389 U.S. 290, 19 L. Ed. 530, 88 Sup. Ct. 438 (1967), the federal common law controls the result here; and that under the federal common law the defendants have a right to build their apartment on a fill on their portion of the lake bed.\\\\nThis contention is based on the fact that defendants\\\\u2019 title is to upland property and submerged land, and is traced to an 1872 federal government patent. This patent was issued prior to Washington statehood, and made no reference to the lake.\\\\nIn Hughes, supra, the issue presented was whether federal or state laws governs the ownership of accreted land, gradually deposited by the ocean on adjoining upland property conveyed by the United States to petitioner\\\\u2019s predecessor in title prior to Washington statehood. The United States Supreme Court held that federal law applied, and that under federal law petitioner was entitled to the accretion that had gradually formed along her ocean-front property.\\\\nThe Hughes decision is in no way applicable to the instant case. We are not concerned here with the ownership of land or the extent or validity of title created by a federal act. As stated by Mr. Justice Stewart, concurring in Hughes, 389 U.S. at 295:\\\\nSurely it must be conceded as a general proposition that the law of real property is, under our Constitution, left to the individual States to develop and administer. And surely Washington or any other State is free to make changes, either legislative or judicial, in its general rules of real property law, including the rules governing the property rights of riparian owners. Nor are riparian owners who derive their title from the United States somehow immune from the changing impact of these general state rules. Joy v. St. Louis, 201 U. S. 332, 342. For if they were, then the property law of a State like Washington, carved entirely out of federal territory, would be forever frozen into the mold it occupied on the date of the State\\\\u2019s admission to the Union.\\\\nWe must, therefore, conclude that there was no error in the trial court\\\\u2019s determination of the property rights of the riparian owners on Bitter Lake, nor in the remedy afforded in the form of a mandatory injunction.\\\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\\\nFinley, C. J., Weaver, Hunter, and McGovern, JJ., concur.\\\\nJanuary 24,1969.

The theory of the action, as settled upon after several pretrial conferences, was that the defendants, the Town of Steilacoom and County of Pierce, had, in approving plans for storm drainage facilities to be constructed by land developers in conjunction with subdivision plats of lands lying east of the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land, effected a taking or damaging of its property. The taking or damaging allegedly resulted from the fact that storm sewers and ditches which were constructed pursuant to the plans, carried onto the plaintiff\\\\u2019s lands more water than would have naturally reached the land and deposited it in a manner different from the natural flow.\\\\nAffidavits which were before the court upon the defendants\\\\u2019 motions for summary judgment showed that there was upon the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land a natural swamp into which surface waters from all of the platted areas naturally drained. A natural watercourse flowed from the northern side of this swamp, over a rim or bluff, down through the town and into Puget Sound. The flow of water was controlled by the superintendent of utilities for the Town of Steilacoom, so that the water in the swamp was maintained at the level at which it had stood prior to the development of the subdivisions.\\\\nIt was the allegedly limited capacity of this watercourse which concerned the plaintiff\\\\u2019s expert engineer, who stated in his affidavit that, while the watercourse had a sufficient capacity to carry all the water which would have been drained from the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land if he had drained it and developed it, provided the lands to the east had remained in their natural condition, it did not have sufficient capacity to drain the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land and carry away the water which was brought to it from the developed lands above. He stated that the watercourse could handle the waters carried to the plaintiff\\\\u2019s lands by the storm drainage facilities only if the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land was used as a holding basin.\\\\nThis engineer\\\\u2019s affidavit stated that the subdivision and development of the platted lands had created a runoff of surface water that made storm drainage necessary. It further stated that prior to the development of the platted lands, surface water that might otherwise have collected by reason of rains was dissipated by evaporation, transpiration, and percolation into the ground. It declared:\\\\nThe removal of timber and undergrowth, and the substitution of streets, driveways, homes, and the like, changes the character of the land to such an extent that the subdeveloper must anticipate that 30%, or more, of any rainfall will be carried away by storm drainage facilities\\\\n9. If no waters were carried to the plaintiff\\\\u2019s lands by the storm drainage systems of the Town of Steilacoom and Pierce County, Washington, the plaintiff\\\\u2019s lands could be entirely drained by a ditch or pipe connecting the lowest elevations of the land with the natural watercourse which begins in the westerly portion of the plaintiff\\\\u2019s lands.\\\\nThis affidavit showed that surface waters collected within the platted lands was discharged upon the plaintiff\\\\u2019s lands through five outlets, either ditches or pipes, and that at each outlet ditches were extended onto the plaintiff\\\\u2019s lands.\\\\nThe defendants\\\\u2019 affidavits showed that water from all the lands in question naturally drained into the swamp on the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land, that no new sources of water had been diverted from their natural flow into the storm sewer system, and that the water table in the swamp had remained the same before and after the development of the platted lands.\\\\nAn affidavit of a real estate appraiser filed on behalf of the plaintiff, stated that the market value of the land had been adversely affected by reason of the fact that surface water was being collected and discharged upon the land from storm sewers.\\\\nThe trial court was of the apparent view that the uncontradicted statement in the defendants\\\\u2019 affidavits that the water level had not risen in the swamp, was proof that the amount of water discharged upon the land from the storm sewer system was not greater than the amount which had drained there naturally before the platted lands were developed. While it recognized that the defendants had trespassed upon the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land to construct ditches for the channeling of the water, it was of the apparent opinion that any damage resulting was of a temporary nature and not compensable in this action.\\\\nA municipality ordinarily is not liable for consequential damages occurring when it increases the flow of surface water onto an owner\\\\u2019s property if the damages arise wholly from changes in the character of the surface produced by the opening of streets, building of houses, and the like, in the ordinary and regular course of the expansion of the municipality. On the other hand, it is liable if, in the course of an authorized construction, it collects surface water by an artificial channel or in large quantities and pours it, in a body, upon the land of a private person, to his injury. Under this rule, while municipal authorities may pave and grade streets and are not ordinarily liable for an increase in surface water naturally falling on the land of a private owner where the work is properly done, they are not permitted to concentrate and gather such water into artificial drains or channels and throw it on the land of an individual owner in such manner and volume as to cause substantial injury to such land and without making adequate provision for its proper outflow, unless compensation is made. 18 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations \\\\u00a7 53.144, at 538 (3d ed. rev. 1963). See Noyes v. Cosselman, 29 Wash. 635, 70 P. 61 (1902). Surface waters may not be artificially collected and discharged upon adjoining lands in quantities greater than or in a manner different from the natural flow thereof. Colella v. King County, 72 Wn.2d 386, 433 P.2d 154 (1967); King County v. Boeing Co., 62 Wn.2d 545, 384 P.2d 122 (1963). At the same time, it is the rule that the flow of surface water along natural drains may be hastened or incidentally increased by artificial means, so long as the water is not ultimately diverted from its natural flow onto the property of another. Laurelon Terrace, Inc. v. Seattle, 40 Wn.2d 883, 246 P.2d 1113 (1952). ^\\\\nHere it is not contended that there has been any diversion of waters from the direction in which they would naturally flow and onto the land of plaintiff. There is, however, a contention that the amount of water has been increased, as a result of the changes in the surface of the soil effected with the approval of the defendants, and there has been a change in the manner of flow, which have resulted in damage to the plaintiff. The affidavit of the plaintiff\\\\u2019s engineer supports both of these contentions. The mere fact that the plaintiff\\\\u2019s engineer does not dispute the fact that the water table in the swamp has not risen does not settle the question whether the amount of water reaching the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land has increased. The defendants\\\\u2019 affidavits show that the water table is deliberately maintained by their agent, who controls the amount of water flowing from the natural watercourse on the west side of the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land. Thus if there is a greater amount of water reaching the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land, the extra water is being drained off by the defendants\\\\u2019 agent.\\\\nHowever, as we-understand the plaintiff\\\\u2019s theory, it is not so much the increased amount of water reaching its land which has caused the drainage problem as it is the fact that the water is being delivered more swiftly and in large amounts rather than in the slow diffuse manner in which it traveled when the platted lands were in their natural state.\\\\nUnder the rules which we have noted, the mere fact that the amount of water reaching the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land, by reason of the development of the platted lands, might be greater than it formerly was, would not entitle it to compensation for any resulting damage. But the fact that the water is collected and deposited upon the land in a different manner does afford a basis for relief, if resulting damage can indeed be proved to the satisfaction of the trier of the facts.\\\\nThis is not a case where the municipality has collected water and directed it into a natural waterway, as in Strickland v. Seattle, 62 Wn.2d 912, 385 P.2d 33 (1963), where we denied recovery to a riparian owner who complained that in collecting water in ditches and sewers and directing it into a natural watercourse, the city had increased the velocity and turbulence of the stream and the rate of flow of silt, with the result that a delta was being built up in the land at the end of the stream.\\\\nThe allegation that the manner in which the water is deposited upon the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land affects the ability to drain that land, may be difficult to prove to the trier of the facts but it is a material question at issue in the case, and not one upon which summary judgment could properly be granted.\\\\nCertainly the ditching done upon the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land is compensable, if it has in fact resulted in damage. Whether it is regarded as a trespass, temporary in nature, or an appropriation of easements across the plaintiff\\\\u2019s lands to carry the water on its way to its ultimate destination, the necessary parties are before the court and there is no reason to relegate the plaintiff to another action to have its rights determined. See Civil Rule for Superior Court 18.\\\\nWe find in the record some acknowledgement on the part of the defendants that they should have made provision for the proper outflow of the water to a natural watercourse, when they gathered the water into artificial drains and cast it upon the land in a manner different from that by which it would have reached the land in its natural state. We think such a duty is in harmony with the cases which we have cited above, if in fact the manner in which the water is collected and directed onto the land has resulted in damage, a question to be determined by the trier of the facts.\\\\nIn considering a motion for summary judgment, the court must consider all evidence and all reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party and summary judgment will be granted only if reasonable men could reach only one conclusion. Meissner v. Simpson Timber Co., 69 Wn.2d 949, 421 P.2d 674 (1966). The plaintiff offered evidence that his land had been damaged as a result of the collecting and discharge of surface waters upon his land in an unnatural manner. He claimed a large amount of damage and may be able to prove only a minimum; nevertheless, he should have his day in court.\\\\nWhen the first of the 18 subdivisions which are involved in this litigation was platted, and prior to its approval by the Town of Steilacoom, the developer secured from the plaintiff\\\\u2019s two controlling stockholders (who admit that it is their alter ego) a release whereby the owners consented to\\\\nthe natural flow of surface water from said plat to be carried in its natural channel across the property of the [owners] and to hold the Town of Steilacoom blameless for any damage that may be caused by said drainage flow\\\\nThe trial court held that this docupient released the Town of Steilacoom from any liability for damage resulting from the flow of waters from the other 17 subdivisions, as well as the first.\\\\nThis document does not purport to pertain to any plat other than the one which was then under consideration, to which reference was made therein. Furthermore, it does not purport to authorize the collecting of water by artificial means and depositing of it upon the land of the plaintiff. It was drawn by the town and must be construed against it. We do not find the release broad enough in its terms to preclude this action.\\\\nThe judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.\\\\nHale, C.J., and Finley, Hunter, Hamilton, Stafford, Wright, Utter, and Brachtenbach, JJ., concur.\\\\nPetition for rehearing denied August 9, 1974.\",\"type\":\"majority\",\"author\":\"Rosellini, J.\"}],\"attorneys\":[\"Kane, Vandeberg & Hartinger, by Harold T.

The facts, so far as they are pertinent to our inquiry, are about these: The Hardman Estate is the owner of a building on Yesler Way, in Seattle, the lower portion of which is divided into storerooms, and the upper is used as a hotel. Appellant, who was engaged in the millinery business, occupied one of the storerooms under a written lease. Some time in August, 1911, the lessee of the hotel portion, although his lease had not expired, vacated the upper stories, and they continued vacant until after the damage complained of. This lessee not having paid his water rent, the city turned off the water from the hotel portion of the building some time in September. This water service so turned off, it appears, did not affect the storeroom occupied by appellant. There was, however, a dwelling on the rear of the lot which was supplied with the same service pipe as the hotel, and which had been vacated for some time. This vacant dwelling in the rear was rented on November 15, and orders given the city to turn on the water, which was done on November 16. Soon after the water was turned on, it began to o flow through the ceiling and into the room occupied by appellant, causing the damage complained of. An examination of the premises disclosed the fact that, in one of the rooms over the storeroom occupied by appellant, a washstand had been torn from the wall and the water pipes broken,\\' making quite a hole through which the water was escaping. It was also discovered that a large rear window opening on the alley had been broken, making an opening large enough for a person to enter the building. It was also shown that, on three other occasions during the vacancy of the hotel portion, the windows on the alley had been broken, supposedly by boys getting into the building. The lease contained the following clause:\\\\n\\\\u201cThat the said lessee shall hold harmless the said lessor and the said lessor\\\\u2019s agents- from all damages of every kind or nature whatsoever that may occur by reason of any accident on said premises, -and from any damage done or occasioned by or from plumbing, gas, water, steam, or other pipes or sewerage ; or the bursting, leaking or running of any cistern, tank, wash-stand, or waste-pipe in, .above, upon or about said building or premises; and from any damage occasioned by water, snow, or ice being upon or coming through the roof, skylight, wall, trapdoor, or otherwise, and from damages arising from acts of neglect of co-tenants or other occupants of the same building, or of any owners or occupants of the adjacent or contiguous property.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis stipulation, in the judgment of the lower court, exempted the respondents from any responsibility in the matter, and was the basis of the ruling complained of. Stipulations of this character cannot be enlarged upon to include any damage not expressly waived, and it is generally held that such a stipulation will not excuse an injury occasioned by the negligence of the landlord in the management and use of any part of the premises remaining under his control. Levin v. Habicht, 45 Misc. 381, 90 N. Y. Supp. 349; 1 Thompson, Negligence, \\\\u00a7 1143. It has also been held that such stipulations cover only ordinary wear and tear, or sudden action of the elements which could not be guarded against, or negligent acts of other tenants. Randolph v. Feist, 23 Misc. 650, 52 N. Y. Supp. 109; Worthington v. Parker, 11 Daly (N. Y.) 545.\\\\nIt is clear from the facts that the damage to appellant was not caused by any breaking of water pipes on the premises leased to her, nor was it due to any negligence of cotenants, nor of owners or occupants of adjacent property, but was due to the bursting or breaking of water pipes on premises not covered by the lease but within the building, and fall within that clause of the waiver exempting damage occasioned by bursting or leaking of washstands in, above, upon, or about the building, or by water coming through the walls. We think it is also clear that the cause of the damage was not an ordinary leak due to defective plumbing or usual wear, such as might be anticipated in any building and thus be within the contemplation of the parties when entering into a stipulation of this character, but was an unusual and unexpected happening, due to other than natural and anticipated defects or lack of repair in any fixture forming part of the water system of the building.\\\\nThere was no evidence that the proximate cause of this damage was any act of the landlord; and if appellant\\\\u2019s cause must rest upon some positive act of the landlord, it must fail. Negligence, however, may be predicated upon the failure to act where the law imposes a duty; and as between the appellant and the landlord, the occupancy and possession of the upper stories, with all the duties .flowing from such a relation, were with the landlord. The landlord could not excuse itself from this duty to appellant because of -the fact that, as between it and the lessee of the upper stories, the possession and occupancy was that of the latter. And this, we think, is so notwithstanding the tenant of the upper story had vacated within the term covered by the lease and the legal right of possession still remained in him. This might be and doubtless was true, as between the landlord and the upper tenant; and as between them, the upper tenant was still bound under his lease. But, whatever may have been the legal fiction, the facts were the upper tenant had vacated the premises and thus occasioned an actual, if not a legal, vacancy. Possession and control must rest somewhere, and as between the landlord and appellant, who was no party to the lease held by the upper tenant and not bound by any contract between this tenant and the landlord, this possession and control was, we think, with the landlord. It, therefore, seems to us, conceding the rule to be that the landlord is under no legal obligation to repair the demised premises, that it was the duty of the landlord to so control and preserve the upper stories as to keep them in a condition of reasonable safety, in so far as such a condition affected the tenant of the lower story; that, if it negligently suffered the upper story to be out of repair to such an extent as to damage the tenant of the lower story, it must respond in damages, and that the ordinary rule we have just referred to does not cover such condition as the facts here present. Priest v. Nichols, 116 Mass. 401.\\\\nSo far as we can gather from the facts, the injury was .caused by evilly disposed persons breaking into the building through the windows in the alley and outside of the premises covered by the lease to appellant. But the duty to guard the premises, so that such persons could not break into the building and injure the fixtures in the upper story, rested with the landlord and not with the appellant; and as it also appeared that these rear windows had been broken on three previous occasions, thus affording entrance to the upper stories, the landlord is chargeable with knowledge of the fact, and having knowledge it was its duty to guard against any recurrence and the natural consequences of such a trespass, by either protecting the premises from such a breaking, or investigating as to any harm that might have been occasioned thereby. The landlord also knew that the hotel section and the house in the rear were connected with the same water service pipe, and before the water was turned on, should have made an investigation of the upper floors to ascertain whether or not such an act could be done with safety to the premises occupied by appellant. Such failure to properly exercise superintendence over the upper story might, it seems to us, within the facts of this case, be\\\\u2019held negligence. Rosenfield v. Newman, 59 Minn. 156, 60 N. W. 1085. At least, we are not so clear it was not negligence as to say the question should not have been submitted to the jury. This disposes of the dismissal as to The Hardman Estate.\\\\nJohn Davis & Company was only the rental agent of the owner. Appellant, having dealt with a known owner and having sought to enforce her cause of action against the principal, cannot hold the agent, and. as to this respondent the dismissal is sustained.\\\\nThe judgment is affirmed as to John Davis & Company, and reversed as to The Hardman Estate.\\\\nCrow, C.

Later they entered into a written lease of the premises for the.term of one year from the 15th day of October, 1922, for a total rental of $3,000, all paid in advance, with an option to renew for an additional year at $275 per month, to be paid monthly in advance. The provisions of the lease with reference to repairs, read:\\\\n\\\\u201cAnd It Is Hereby Agreed, that the parties of the second part are to maintain and keep said building in good repair and return same at the expiration of this lease to the party of the first part, its heirs, administrators or assigns in as good condition as at the present time, excepting that first party will make repairs to the exterior of premises occasioned by reasonable use and wear thereof.\\\\u201d \\\\u2022\\\\nAttached to the lease as a rider, or indorsed thereon, was the following provision, signed by both parties:\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is further agreed in the foregoing lease that in the event that said premises shall be destroyed by fire or that second parties are unable to occupy the said premises on account of fire, that the unearned portion of the money deposited for the first year\\\\u2019s rent shall be refunded to the second party by the first party, and that the second party shall have a lien upon any insurance money payable on account of such fire or destruction on account of fire for the payment of said sum, and in the event that any portion of said premises cannot be occupied, or that the said second party shall be dispossessed of said premises before the expiration of the first year\\\\u2019s lease by the act of the first party or by process of law, without the fault or neglect of the second party, that then the unearned portion of said payment shall be refunded to the second party.\\\\u201d\\\\nEarly on the morning of January 2, 1923, the boiler of the heating plant in the leased building was found to be leaking badly, and on examination it was found that tbe bottom of tbe boiler bad rusted out, so that it was beyond repair, and that a new boiler was absolutely necessary. Tbe building was then occupied by guests and tenants who required beat for tbeir comfort and well-being, and something bad to be done immediately. . Appellant Bonza wired tbe landlord, respondent, who was a non-resident, advising him somewhat as to tbe situation, and without awaiting any reply to bis telegram ordered a new boiler installed by tbe plaintiff at an expense of $939.25. Not having been paid therefor, tbe plaintiff brought this action against both tbe owner and tbe tenant for tbe price of tbe installation of tbe new boiler. Tbe tenants Bonza cross-complained against tbe landlord, Hardung,- asking in effect that, if they were held liable to tbe plaintiff, they might have judgment over against Hardung. Tbe case was tried to tbe court sitting without a jury, resulting in a judgment in favor of tbe plaintiff and against tbe appellants Bonza only, for tbe full amount claimed, and denying appellants any recovery from Hardung on tbeir cross-complaint. From that part of tbe judgment denying appellants a judgment over against Hardung, tbe defendants and cross-complainants, Bonza and wife, have appealed.\\\\nAppellants urge, and tbe evidence tends to show, that this was not an ordinary repair, since it was testified that with proper care tbe new boiler would last practically a lifetime, and authorities are cited which distinguish between repairs and renewals or replacements. But, as we read tbe covenant, it is not simply a covenant to make ordinary repairs. Tbe words: \\\\u201cto maintain and keep said building in good repair and return same at tbe expiration of this lease to tbe party of the first part, . . . in as good condition as at tbe present time, excepting that first party will make repairs to the exterior of premises occasioned by reasonable nse and wear thereof,\\\\u201d when construed as a whole, and effect given to every part, seem beyond cavil to bear only the meaning which the trial court evidently ascribed to them.\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is the well settled common law rule that a tenant\\\\u2019s general covenant to repair the demised premises binds him under all circumstances, even though the injury proceeds from an act of God, from the elements, or from the act of a stranger, and if he desires to relieve himself from liability for injuries resulting from any of the causes above enumerated, or from any other cause whatever, he must take care to except them from the operation of his covenant. Under this rule, if the tenant enters into an express and unconditional covenant to repair and keep in repair, or to surrender the premises in good repair, he is liable for the destruction of buildings not rebuilt by him, though the destruction may have occurred by fire or other accident, or by the act of enemies, without fault on his part.\\\\u201d 16 E. C. L. p. 1088, \\\\u00a7 605.\\\\nIn our own case of Robinson v. Wilson, 102 Wash. 528, it was said:\\\\n\\\\u201cWe think it will not be questioned that a landlord is not a guarantor of the fitness of a building for the purpose for which it is leased unless he binds himself by written contract. Nor will the fact that he knows the use to which it is to be put hold him to such liability where, as in this case, no restrictions are put upon the use of the building in the written lease.\\\\n\\\\u201c \\\\u2018It is agreed by the authorities at the present time that, as a general rule, there is no obligation on the part of the lessor to see that the premises are, at the time of the demise, in a condition of fitness for use for the purpose for which the lessee may propose to use them. A lessee, like the purchaser of a thing already in existence, is presumed to take only after examination. The maxim caveat emptor applies, and if he desires to protect himself in this regard he must exact of the lessor an express stipulation as to the condition of the premises.\\\\u2019 Tiffany, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a786.\\\\n\\\\u201c \\\\u2018As the landlord is under no obligation to the lessee, as regards the condition of the premises, or its fitness for the lessee\\\\u2019s purpose, at the time of the demise, so he is under no obligation to the lessee, or to the latter\\\\u2019s assignee, to keep the premises during the tenancy in a condition satisfactory to the latter. Accordingly, a landlord is not bound, as a general rule, in the absence of special stipulation, to make repairs or improvements on the premises in order to render them safe or fit them for the tenant\\\\u2019s use. And as a result of this principle, the tenant cannot assert any claim against the landlord on account of injury to himself or his property owing to defects in the premises arising since the demise. . . . Even though the\\\\npremises are leased for a particular purpose, and any other use thereof is prohibited, the landlord is, it has been decided, under no obligation to keep them fit for such use.\\\\u2019 Id., \\\\u00a787.\\\\n\\\\u201cSee, also, Taylor, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a7327, et seq.; 24 Cyc. 1081.\\\\n\\\\u201cThe trouble in this case is that we are asked to make a contract grounded in the equities incident to subsequent events, where the parties, who might have foreseen every incident and circumstances now relied on, failed to guard against them in their written contract. And this is where the trial judge fell into error. He says:\\\\n\\\\u201c \\\\u2018I think, however, that it cannot be successfully disputed that in the extreme wet months of the year there are defects in the building and heating plant, Which are not within the contemplation of the lease, and which resulted in a loss to the defendants.\\\\u2019\\\\n\\\\u201cIt may at times result in inequity, but the law is so written that a landlord is not bound beyond the terms of his lease, and that parties who enter written contracts are presumed to have in contemplation probable consequence and the established principles of law.\\\\n\\\\u201cWritten contracts would be of little consequence to the business world if they were to be so overcome, or, if working to the disadvantage of one who has agreed to pay a certain price, his express contract could he turned, over the protest of his adversary, into a quantum valebat.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe reasoning in Johnston v. Nichols, 83 Wash. 394, 145 Pac. 417; Clarke v. Yukon Investment Co., 83 Wash. 485, 145 Pac. 624, Ann. Cas. 1916E 625; and Lodge Room Co. v. Pacific Bond & Inv. Co., 84 Wash. 150, 146 Pac. 376; tend towards the same results. The rider already quoted seems to fortify this view, since it permits of a refund of rental only in case of fire or dispossession without fault.\\\\nWe need not inquire as to what would have been the liability of either party if the tenant had treated the failure of the boiler as an ouster, because that question is not here.\\\\nThough the law may seem harsh as applied to this particular case, yet, for the general good, it must be maintained, and landlords and tenants alike must he left to guard against unusual conditions by the terms of their contracts.\\\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\\\nMain, C.

      "The prominent legal precedents in Washington regarding water leaking into an apartment from the floor above involve several key principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Landlord's Duty to Repair and Maintain**: Generally, landlords are not obligated to repair or maintain leased premises unless explicitly stated in the lease. However, if the landlord undertakes repairs, they must do so non-negligently.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Swanson v. White & Bollard, Inc.**: The landlord was not initially obligated to repair a leaking faucet, but once they undertook the repair, they were required to do so in a non-negligent manner. The court found no causal connection between the landlord's repair and the injury caused by the broken faucet handle, and the tenant had agreed to make all repairs (185 Wash. 407, 1936).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Implied Warranty of Habitability**: This principle holds that landlords must ensure the premises are habitable and fit for living. This includes maintaining essential services like plumbing and preventing conditions that could lead to significant water damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Foisy v. Wyman**: The court recognized an implied warranty of habitability, requiring landlords to maintain premises in a livable condition. The tenant's obligation to pay rent is contingent on the landlord's duty to provide habitable living conditions. The court found that the landlord's failure to maintain the premises in a habitable condition could constitute a defense against rent payment (83 Wash. 2d 22, 1973).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Negligence and Liability for Water Damage**: Landlords can be held liable for water damage if it is shown that they were negligent in maintaining the property or if they failed to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Le Vette v. Hardman Estate**: The court held that a landlord could be liable for water damage to a tenant's property if the damage was due to the landlord's negligence in maintaining the premises. The landlord's failure to secure the premises and inspect for potential water damage after knowing the property had been broken into multiple times constituted negligence (77 Wash. 320, 1914).\n",
      "\n",
      "These cases illustrate that while landlords are not always obligated to repair, they must perform any undertaken repairs non-negligently and maintain habitable conditions. Negligence in maintaining the property can lead to liability for damages caused by water leaks.\n"

       "\"The prominent legal precedents in Washington regarding water leaking into an apartment from the floor above involve principles related to landlord liability for defects and the duty to repair. Here are the top legal principles and illustrative cases:\\n\\n### 1. **Landlord's Duty to Repair and Maintain Safe Conditions**\\nLandlords have a duty to maintain rental properties in a safe and habitable condition. This includes addressing defects that could cause water leakage from one apartment to another.\\n\\n**Illustrative Cases:**\\n- **Andrews v. McCutcheon (1943)**: The landlord was found liable for injuries sustained by a tenant due to a defective stairway. The court held that if the landlord retains control over common areas or facilities, they have a duty to keep them in a reasonably safe condition.\\n- **Taylor v. Stimson (1958)**: The court ruled that a landlord is not responsible for defects known to the tenant at the time of leasing unless there is an agreement to repair. However, if the landlord promises to repair and fails to do so, they could be liable for resulting damages.\\n\\n### 2. **Implied Warranty of Habitability**\\nLandlords implicitly warrant that the premises are fit for habitation. This includes ensuring that there are no water leaks that could affect the habitability of the apartment.\\n\\n**Illustrative Cases:**\\n- **Puget Investment Co. v. Wenck (1950)**: The court discussed the obligations of a tenant to maintain the premises but also highlighted the landlord's responsibilities for structural repairs and maintaining the habitability of the property.\\n- **DiBlasi v. City of Seattle (1998)**: Although primarily about municipal liability, this case underscores the importance of maintaining property in a condition that prevents water damage and other hazards.\\n\\n### 3. **Negligence and Failure to Act**\\nA landlord can be held liable for negligence if they fail to act upon known defects that result in water damage to a tenant's property.\\n\\n**Illustrative Cases:**\\n- **Wilber Dev. Corp. v. Les Rowland Constr., Inc. (1974)**: The court held that municipalities (and by extension, landlords) are not liable for increased surface water flow due to natural conditions but are liable if they collect and channel water in a way that causes damage to private property.\\n- **Schedler v. Wagner (1950)**: The court found that a landlord who assumes the duty to remove snow and ice from walkways must do so with reasonable care, or they can be held liable for resulting injuries. This principle can extend to water leaks and other maintenance issues.\\n\\nThese cases collectively establish that landlords in Washington have a duty to maintain their properties in a habitable condition, address known defects, and can be held liable for damages resulting from their negligence or failure to repair.\""

       "\"The prominent legal precedents in Washington regarding water leaking into an apartment from the floor above are based on two main legal principles: the duty of care in maintaining premises and the implied warranty of habitability.\\n\\n### 1. **Duty of Care in Maintaining Premises**\\nThis principle holds landlords responsible for maintaining the premises in a safe and habitable condition, especially when defects are known or should have been known to them. The landlord must ensure that the property does not pose a danger to the tenants.\\n\\n#### **Prominent Cases:**\\n- **Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co.** (1914): The court held the landlord liable for damages caused by water leaking from a pipe in the upper story, which the landlord failed to maintain properly. The landlord's negligence in maintaining the water pipe led to the flooding of the tenant's store, causing significant damage.\\n- **Thomas v. Housing Authority of the City of Bremerton** (1967): The court found the landlord liable for injuries caused by excessively hot water from a water heater, which was a known defect. The landlord's failure to maintain the water heater in a safe condition constituted negligence.\\n- **Jorgensen v. Massart** (1963): The court held that the landlord was responsible for damages caused by water leaking into the tenant's apartment due to the landlord's failure to maintain the building's roof properly.\\n\\n### 2. **Implied Warranty of Habitability**\\nThis principle implies that landlords must provide and maintain rental properties in a condition fit for human habitation. This includes ensuring that essential services such as plumbing are functional and do not pose health hazards.\\n\\n#### **Prominent Cases:**\\n- **Foisy v. Wyman** (1973): The court recognized the implied warranty of habitability, holding that landlords must maintain rental properties in a habitable condition. The tenant was allowed to present evidence of the landlord's failure to repair significant defects, including water leaks, as a defense in an unlawful detainer action.\\n- **Stuart v. Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, Inc.** (1987): The court extended the implied warranty of habitability to condominium units, requiring that common areas and limited common areas be maintained in a condition fit for their intended use. The landlord was held liable for failing to address water leaks and other defects.\\n\\n### Summary\\nIn Washington, landlords are required to maintain rental properties in a safe and habitable condition. Failure to address known defects, such as water leaks from the floor above, can result in liability for damages under the principles of duty of care and implied warranty of habitability. Prominent cases such as Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co., Thomas v. Housing Authority of the City of Bremerton, Jorgensen v. Massart, Foisy v. Wyman, and Stuart v. Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, Inc. illustrate these principles and the legal obligations of landlords.\""

Bonza et al., Appellants.\"],\"opinions\":[{\"text\":\"Tolman, J.\\\\nThe appellants, Bonza and wife, became the tenants of respondent, Hardung, April 1, 1922, occupying under an oral lease an apartment house in the city of Spokane, known as the Blackstone Apartments, for which they paid $300 monthly as rental. Later they entered into a written lease of the premises for the.term of one year from the 15th day of October, 1922, for a total rental of $3,000, all paid in advance, with an option to renew for an additional year at $275 per month, to be paid monthly in advance. The provisions of the lease with reference to repairs, read:\\\\n\\\\u201cAnd It Is Hereby Agreed, that the parties of the second part are to maintain and keep said building in good repair and return same at the expiration of this lease to the party of the first part, its heirs, administrators or assigns in as good condition as at the present time, excepting that first party will make repairs to the exterior of premises occasioned by reasonable use and wear thereof.\\\\u201d \\\\u2022\\\\nAttached to the lease as a rider, or indorsed thereon, was the following provision, signed by both parties:\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is further agreed in the foregoing lease that in the event that said premises shall be destroyed by fire or that second parties are unable to occupy the said premises on account of fire, that the unearned portion of the money deposited for the first year\\\\u2019s rent shall be refunded to the second party by the first party, and that the second party shall have a lien upon any insurance money payable on account of such fire or destruction on account of fire for the payment of said sum, and in the event that any portion of said premises cannot be occupied, or that the said second party shall be dispossessed of said premises before the expiration of the first year\\\\u2019s lease by the act of the first party or by process of law, without the fault or neglect of the second party, that then the unearned portion of said payment shall be refunded to the second party.\\\\u201d\\\\nEarly on the morning of January 2, 1923, the boiler of the heating plant in the leased building was found to be leaking badly, and on examination it was found that tbe bottom of tbe boiler bad rusted out, so that it was beyond repair, and that a new boiler was absolutely necessary. Tbe building was then occupied by guests and tenants who required beat for tbeir comfort and well-being, and something bad to be done immediately. . Appellant Bonza wired tbe landlord, respondent, who was a non-resident, advising him somewhat as to tbe situation, and without awaiting any reply to bis telegram ordered a new boiler installed by tbe plaintiff at an expense of $939.25. Not having been paid therefor, tbe plaintiff brought this action against both tbe owner and tbe tenant for tbe price of tbe installation of tbe new boiler. Tbe tenants Bonza cross-complained against tbe landlord, Hardung,- asking in effect that, if they were held liable to tbe plaintiff, they might have judgment over against Hardung. Tbe case was tried to tbe court sitting without a jury, resulting in a judgment in favor of tbe plaintiff and against tbe appellants Bonza only, for tbe full amount claimed, and denying appellants any recovery from Hardung on tbeir cross-complaint. From that part of tbe judgment denying appellants a judgment over against Hardung, tbe defendants and cross-complainants, Bonza and wife, have appealed.\\\\nAppellants urge, and tbe evidence tends to show, that this was not an ordinary repair, since it was testified that with proper care tbe new boiler would last practically a lifetime, and authorities are cited which distinguish between repairs and renewals or replacements. But, as we read tbe covenant, it is not simply a covenant to make ordinary repairs. Tbe words: \\\\u201cto maintain and keep said building in good repair and return same at tbe expiration of this lease to tbe party of the first part, . . . in as good condition as at tbe present time, excepting that first party will make repairs to the exterior of premises occasioned by reasonable nse and wear thereof,\\\\u201d when construed as a whole, and effect given to every part, seem beyond cavil to bear only the meaning which the trial court evidently ascribed to them.\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is the well settled common law rule that a tenant\\\\u2019s general covenant to repair the demised premises binds him under all circumstances, even though the injury proceeds from an act of God, from the elements, or from the act of a stranger, and if he desires to relieve himself from liability for injuries resulting from any of the causes above enumerated, or from any other cause whatever, he must take care to except them from the operation of his covenant. Under this rule, if the tenant enters into an express and unconditional covenant to repair and keep in repair, or to surrender the premises in good repair, he is liable for the destruction of buildings not rebuilt by him, though the destruction may have occurred by fire or other accident, or by the act of enemies, without fault on his part.\\\\u201d 16 E. C. L. p. 1088, \\\\u00a7 605.\\\\nIn our own case of Robinson v. Wilson, 102 Wash. 528, it was said:\\\\n\\\\u201cWe think it will not be questioned that a landlord is not a guarantor of the fitness of a building for the purpose for which it is leased unless he binds himself by written contract. Nor will the fact that he knows the use to which it is to be put hold him to such liability where, as in this case, no restrictions are put upon the use of the building in the written lease.\\\\n\\\\u201c \\\\u2018It is agreed by the authorities at the present time that, as a general rule, there is no obligation on the part of the lessor to see that the premises are, at the time of the demise, in a condition of fitness for use for the purpose for which the lessee may propose to use them. A lessee, like the purchaser of a thing already in existence, is presumed to take only after examination. The maxim caveat emptor applies, and if he desires to protect himself in this regard he must exact of the lessor an express stipulation as to the condition of the premises.\\\\u2019 Tiffany, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a786.\\\\n\\\\u201c \\\\u2018As the landlord is under no obligation to the lessee, as regards the condition of the premises, or its fitness for the lessee\\\\u2019s purpose, at the time of the demise, so he is under no obligation to the lessee, or to the latter\\\\u2019s assignee, to keep the premises during the tenancy in a condition satisfactory to the latter. Accordingly, a landlord is not bound, as a general rule, in the absence of special stipulation, to make repairs or improvements on the premises in order to render them safe or fit them for the tenant\\\\u2019s use. And as a result of this principle, the tenant cannot assert any claim against the landlord on account of injury to himself or his property owing to defects in the premises arising since the demise. . . . Even though the\\\\npremises are leased for a particular purpose, and any other use thereof is prohibited, the landlord is, it has been decided, under no obligation to keep them fit for such use.\\\\u2019 Id., \\\\u00a787.\\\\n\\\\u201cSee, also, Taylor, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a7327, et seq.; 24 Cyc. 1081.\\\\n\\\\u201cThe trouble in this case is that we are asked to make a contract grounded in the equities incident to subsequent events, where the parties, who might have foreseen every incident and circumstances now relied on, failed to guard against them in their written contract. And this is where the trial judge fell into error. He says:\\\\n\\\\u201c \\\\u2018I think, however, that it cannot be successfully disputed that in the extreme wet months of the year there are defects in the building and heating plant, Which are not within the contemplation of the lease, and which resulted in a loss to the defendants.\\\\u2019\\\\n\\\\u201cIt may at times result in inequity, but the law is so written that a landlord is not bound beyond the terms of his lease, and that parties who enter written contracts are presumed to have in contemplation probable consequence and the established principles of law.\\\\n\\\\u201cWritten contracts would be of little consequence to the business world if they were to be so overcome, or, if working to the disadvantage of one who has agreed to pay a certain price, his express contract could he turned, over the protest of his adversary, into a quantum valebat.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe reasoning in Johnston v. Nichols, 83 Wash. 394, 145 Pac. 417; Clarke v. Yukon Investment Co., 83 Wash. 485, 145 Pac. 624, Ann. Cas. 1916E 625; and Lodge Room Co. v. Pacific Bond & Inv. Co., 84 Wash. 150, 146 Pac. 376; tend towards the same results. The rider already quoted seems to fortify this view, since it permits of a refund of rental only in case of fire or dispossession without fault.\\\\nWe need not inquire as to what would have been the liability of either party if the tenant had treated the failure of the boiler as an ouster, because that question is not here.\\\\nThough the law may seem harsh as applied to this particular case, yet, for the general good, it must be maintained, and landlords and tenants alike must he left to guard against unusual conditions by the terms of their contracts.\\\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\\\nMain, C.

Gjarde, by the terms of which Gjarde agreed to erect for the DeHoneys a building on a described tract of land, in the city of Seattle, to be used as a dancing academy. The contract provided that Gjarde should furnish all the necessary labor and materials and erect the building according to plans and specifications agreed upon between the parties,- prepared by one Svarz as architect. The contract price was $27,329, and the building was to be completed on or before 110 days from tbe date of tbe contract. Gjarde entered at once upon tbe performance of tbe work, completed it witbin tbe time fixed by tbe contract, and was paid tbe contract price.\\\\nDeHoney and wife took possession of tbe building sometime in August, 1923, and began to use it for tbe purposes for wbicb it was constructed. Tbe building gave no trouble during tbe dry weather wbicb followed tbe time possession was taken, but in tbe latter part of October, when tbe. rainy season began, water came into tbe ball of tbe building used for dancing in considerable quantities; so considerable, in fact, as to damage tbe furnishings and to cause tbe dancing floor to swell and buckle. The DeHoneys conceived that tbe water came into tbe room because of a defective and leaking roof, and called upon Gjarde to repair it. Some correspondence passed between them, resulting in a denial on tbe part of Gjarde of liability. Tbe DeHoneys caused tbe roof to be repaired by another person, and caused some additional ventilation to be installed in tbe building, whereupon water ceased to come into the room, and the walls thereof became dry soon thereafter.\\\\nTbe DeHoneys, as plaintiffs, thereafter began tbe present action to recover against Gjarde and bis bondsman, tbe Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland, in damages for tbe injuries caused by tbe water. They alleged that Gjarde failed to construct tbe building in accordance with tbe plans and specifications, in that be \\\\u201cnegligently and carelessly failed to turn up tbe felt and flashings onto the walls of said building not less than 18 inches as tbe contract and good workmanship required, but instead turned tbe same up not to exceed 12 inches in any place, and around tbe greater portion of tbe walls, not to exceed four inches, and negligently and carelessly failed to put tbe same up tight against said walls or to nail or otherwise fasten or cement the same at sufficiently close intervals, so that as a result the upper portions of the same were allowed to be loose and to bulge out from said walls, so that water could go- through where the same should have been fastened tight to the walls and from thence go down under the roofing and thence into the building; that where there were columns erected just inside said side walls, making numerous angles, the said felt and flashings were in some places pressed in so hard by them as to have cracked and broken the same, leaving openings for the water to go through, while in other places, they negligently and carelessly failed to press the same into- the angles sufficiently, but on the contrary allowed the same-to be loose and to bulge out at the top where it should have been tightly joined to the wall, so that the water could run down into the building as hereinbefore mentioned; that they negligently and carelessly allowed approximately 100 holes and openings to be and remain where the water could leak through, said holes and openings, for the most part being located where said felt and flashings should have been joined tight to the wall and columns, and where the same had been broken as hereinbefore mentioned, which were thereupon hidden by them by placing the counter flashings so as to conceal the same; that the top of said counter flashings was fastened by them to a wooden strip set in the concrete wall; that they negligently placed around said wooden strip certain plaster which was made out of poor material in that there was too much sand in the same, so that the same was so porous that it allowed the water to run through the same and back of said counter flashings and that much of said plastering material fell out after the same became water soaked; that the felt and flash-ings around the ventilators were not properly fastened by them, as hereinbefore stated, so- that the same were loose and bulged at the top, allowing the water to leak in; that the paper used by them on the slopes where the roof slopes steeply from the upper portion of the roof to the \\'valley\\\\u2019 portion of the roof below, was of poor quality, in that the same was checked and cracked; that the paper used by them on the roof and slopes was so put together by them that the same would leak at the joints and seams, the cause thereof not being known to plaintiffs; that along the south side of said building there were leaks under the windows; that they wholly failed to place any galvanized iron boxes in the comers, surrounding the drain pipes, but instead placed boxes made of cheap tin, none of which were securely soldered, so that the water leaked out of them, instead of going into the pipes; that no screens were placed in said boxes until after the first rains hereinafter mentioned, and on approximately the 17th day of November, 1923, thus allowing said pipes to become clogged; that by reason of the matters herein-above set forth, said building, when turned over to the plaintiffs on or about Aug. 29,1922, did not have a roof capable of turning water during an ordinary rain, but on the contrary said roof was in such condition as to be leaky in wet weather, none of which defects were discovered by plaintiffs or known to them until the rains hereinafter mentioned occurred.\\\\u201d\\\\nDamages were claimed in the following sums for the following items:\\\\nRepairing roof ........................... $541.35\\\\nCarpenter work .......................... 400.30\\\\nRedecorating the walls and work on damaged paintings ............................. 403.65\\\\nPlumbing work........................... 25.47\\\\nTinning.................................. 5.25\\\\nResurfacing the dancing floor.............. 600.00\\\\nRedecorating the walls and ceiling.......... 1,500.00\\\\nAdditional work on paintings.............. 600.00\\\\nDamage to seats.......................... 800.00\\\\nDamage to piano...................\\\\u2022...... 500.00\\\\nDamage to curtains....................... 300.00\\\\nDepreciation of building (Not repairable).. .10,000.00\\\\nLoss of profits because of non-usability of building ..............................25,000.00\\\\nThe first five of the items of damage were for money actually expended for the work therein indicated. Other items, in so far as they relate to work, were the estimates of witnesses of the reasonable cost of performance. The remaining items are self-explanatory. After issue had been joined on the complaint, a trial was entered upon before a jury. During the course of the trial the court withdrew from the consideration of the jury the item of damage relating to loss of profits. The jury, on the remaining items, returned a general verdict for the plaintiffs in the sum of $14,500.25. Within due time, the defendants moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or, in the alternative, for a new trial. The court denied the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, but entered an order to the effect that it would grant the motion for a new trial unless within twenty days thereafter the plaintiffs would in writing remit from the amount of the verdict the sum of $10,000; further ordering that, in case such remission be made, the plaintiffs have judgment for the amount of the remainder of the verdict. The remission was filed within the required time, and thereupon judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiffs for the sum of $4,500.25.\\\\nThe plaintiffs also moved for a new trial on the question of damages for loss of profits, which motion the court denied. Both parties appeal; the defendants from the judgment entered, and the plaintiffs from the order of the court refusing them a new trial on the question of the loss of profits.\\\\nTaking up the appeal of the defendants, they first assign error on the ruling of the court denying them a new trial. Under this head they present a number of questions, the first being that the verdict was the result of passion and prejudice on the part of the jury. It is said that this is evidenced (1) by the amount of the verdict, (2) because the verdict is contrary to the evidence, and (3) because the trial court so found. Noticing these in their order, of the first it can be said that the verdict was well within the testimony introduced on the part of the plaintiffs. The total sum claimed by the plaintiffs, and which their evidence tended to prove, omitting the claim of $25,000 for loss of profits which the court took from the jury, was $15,676.02. The general verdict of the jury was for $14,500.25. Manifestly, it seems to- us this is not so close an approximation to the plaintiffs\\\\u2019 claims as to furnish conclusive proofs that the jury gave the evidence no consideration, but followed blindly the plaintiffs \\\\u2019 testimony.\\\\nNor did the question of the amount of damages suffered rest upon the testimony of the plaintiffs alone. They were supported by competent disinterested witnesses, some of whom had made estimates with a view of repairing the damages. Nor was the item of depreciation without evidence in its support. In addition to the estimates, a witness who had been engaged in building construction for twenty-three years testified that in his judgment the building was depreciated in value by the flooding to which it had been subjected in the sum of $10,000. The amount of the depreciation is, of course, of no moment on the present appeal, since the plaintiffs consented to waive their claim thereto rather than submit to a new trial. It is mentioned to repel the inference which might otherwise be thought to obtain, that the jury returned a verdict for a claim unsupported by evidence. True, there are affidavits of certain jurors to the effect that some of the items of damage were allowed in full and others disallowed, but conceding that jurors may thus explain their verdict after their discharge, there is nothing in the fact which so far impeaches it as to require the court to say that it was the result of passion and prejudice. Moreover, we do not find\\' in the record that the estimates of the plaintiffs \\\\u2019 witnesses were disputed by the other side. There was a leakage from the roof at one time for which the defendants admitted fault, and they offered testimony to the effect that the damage caused thereby did not exceed $50, but on the general question of the amount of damages, the cause went to the jury on the testimony of the plaintiffs \\\\u2019 witnesses. It would seem that, under these circumstances, the court could hardly find either passion or prejudice had the verdict been for the full amount demanded.\\\\nThe second contention under this head is that the overwhelming weight of the evidence relating to the cause of the damage is against the verdict of the jury. It is first argued that the building was constructed according to the plans and specifications, and if it was so constructed as not to furnish protection against leaks in the roof, it was the fault of the plaintiffs who furnished the plans and specifications, and not the fault of the builder. To an understanding of this argument some notice must be taken of the plans and specifications. The building was in size 72 feet by 128 feet. It was a one-story building with the ceiling 18 feet above the floor. The walls were of six-inch reinforced concrete. The roof was for the greater part comparatively flat, breaking down at rather a sharp angle as the walls were approached, forming a valley or gutter along the walls. The frame work was of wood construction covered over with sheathing hoards. Over the sheathing boards was laid a dry sheet of felt, and over this four layers of felt glued together with roofing cement. On top of this was poured a coating of asphalt onto which gravel was spread. The construction of the slopes was the same as the main part of the roof, except that the gravel was omitted and in its stead was placed an additional thickness of 3-ply Lastile roofing, called a finishing sheet. The plans required the felt to reach across the valley formed by the junction of the roof and the wall, and to extend up the wall for a distance of 18 inches. This extension is called in the record the base-flashing. It was to be well pressed into angles of the wall, reinforced with a strip of felt eight inches wide, cemented solidly in place, and covered by a counter-flashing \\\\u2014 a strip of galvanized iron fastened into the wall and bent over the base-flashing. The counter-flashing was fastened to a reglet placed in the wall at the time the concrete was poured. The valleys or gutters were constructed with a slope or pitch towards the comers of the building wherein were placed outlet boxes with pipes leading to the city sewers, furnishing an escape for water falling on the roof.\\\\nBy some miscalculation the reglets were not placed high enough in the walls of the building to permit the base-flashing to extend up the walls for the distance called for by the plans and specifications \\\\u2014 the actual distance, instead of being eighteen inches as the plans required, was twelve inches at the highest place, ranging from that distance down to four inches at the lowest. It was the testimony of plaintiffs and their witnesses that the base-flashings were not cemented to the wall and that water falling on the roof and flowing into the valley would rise higher than the base-flashing, pass under the counter-flashing and flow down between the base-flashing and the wall of the building and come out into the main dancing hall. The evidence on the part of the defendants, on the other hand, was to the effect that there was no leaking in this manner, that the water that was found in the dancing room was the result of condensation, caused by the crowds that gathered in the room and insufficient ventilation. The evidence on these discordant views it would serve no useful purpose to review. As we read the record, the evidence preponderates on the side of the plaintiffs. At the least, there was substantial evidence supporting the view of the plaintiffs sufficient to warrant the jury in so finding without subjecting them to the charge of being controlled by the undue influence of passion and prejudice.\\\\nThe third ground assigned for the conclusion that the jury were influenced by passion and prejudice in rendering their verdict, we think, is also without foundation. The matter arose out of the argument of one of the plaintiffs\\\\u2019 counsel to the jury. It appears in the record by affidavits filed by the defendants in support of their motion for a new trial, and opposing affidavits by the other side, no stenographic report of the argument being taken. In the defendants\\\\u2019 affidavits counsel for the plaintiffs is accused of stating to the jury that the court in its rulings and conduct unduly favored the defendants; the more precise charge being that counsel stated to the jury that in his cross examination of one of the defendants\\\\u2019 witnesses he had the witness \\\\u201ccornered,\\\\u201d and that the court came to his relief by calling a recess, giving the witness an opportunity to collect his thoughts. In the opposing affidavits it is admitted that counsel said something in the nature of the remark cited to* the jury, but he denies that his language was capable of the interpretation put upon it by the defendants, that he expressly disclaimed at the time that he was charging the court with unfairness, and stated expressly that the recess was called because the usual time therefor had arrived. * In passing upon the motion for a new trial, the court stated that he thought the remark was very unfortunate, and that it \\\\u201cmust have had some effect upon the jury\\\\u201d; further stating that ordinarily remarks of this sort \\\\u201creact on the person making the remark, but it is evident in this case it did not, in view of the verdict that was returned.\\\\u201d\\\\nIt is from these statements of the court that the defendants draw the conclusion that the court found that the jury\\\\u2019s verdict was the result of passion and prejudice. But we cannot draw therefrom a like conclusion. The court\\\\u2019s very ruling on the motion is conclusive to the contrary. The trial judge is distinguished and experienced. He has long presided on the trial bench, and it is unthinkable that his sense of justice would permit him to let the verdict stand if he was of the belief that it was founded on something other than the evidence in the cause. It is our feeling that much is here made of little. At the time of the argument, the remark was not regarded as of sufficient moment to require notice either by the trial judge or by the opposing counsel. Manifestly, if it was then thought that it contained the sinister charge now imputed to it, it would not have gone unchallenged.\\\\nIt is further argued in this connection that the remarks imputed to counsel require a reversal in any event, regardless of the question of passion or prejudice. But we think we need not pursue the inquiry further than to add that in this aspect it is not sufficiently before the court for review. No objection to the remark was made at the time of its utterance. The rule is that improper argument of counsel cannot be successfully assigned as error unless there has been a request to the court to correct it by instructing the jury to disregard it, or unless the misconduct is so flagrant as to be incapable of cure by instruction. Canfield v. Seattle Cornice Works, 122 Wash. 318, 210 Pac. 773; Vanderveer v. Hillman, 122 Wash. 684, 211 Pac. 722. In our view, there was nothing in the remark here incapable of cure by instructions.\\\\nThe next contention is that, if the damage to the building was the fault of a leaking roof, it was due to defects in the design of the building and not due to the fault of the contractor. To an understanding of the objection some further description of the manner in which the roof was constructed is necessary. Where the roof supports joined the wall of the building, a valley was left by the mode of construction required of some eight or nine inches wide only. The plans required a galvanized iron drain box twelve inches wide to be inserted in the valley to facilitate the flow of water to the outlet pipes located at the comers of the building, and further required that the drain should have a slope. A drain box twelve inches wide would not thus rest on the top of the supporting beams, or closer thereto than some four or more inches. In making the measurements for the insertion in the wall of the reglets at the time of its construction, no allowance was made either for this elevation or for the slope of the box, and apparently there were other things which raised the bottom of the valley for which no allowance was made. As the position of the reglets measured the height of the base-flashings, the result was that the flashings did not extend eighteen inches above the bottom of the valley.\\\\nIt is claimed that the scale drawings of the architect showing the position in the wall at which the reglets were to be inserted made no allowance for these differences, and that there was thus a conflict between the plans and specifications and the scale drawings, and that the builder was justified in following the scale drawings. It is further contended that the architect, who was empowered by the building contract to reconcile conflicts that might exist between the plans, specifications and drawings, had his attention called to this discrepancy at the time it was discovered, and that he not only approved the work at that time, but also subsequently accepted the completed work as a compliance with the contract. But we cannot accept these conclusions. As we view the drawings, it required some rather delicate measurements to determine the position of the reglets in the wall from the drawings alone, and that error could easily occur by relying upon such measurements. But the rule is that plans, specifications and drawings for a building must be construed as a whole, and plainly, nothing more than a casual examination of the whole would at once disclose that measurements from the top of the roof beams would not permit the insertion of the base-flash-ings to the height required by the plans and specifications. Nor do we think that the approval of the architect bound the owners. At the time of the acceptance and final payment, they were ignorant of this failure to follow the plans and specifications, and we find this clause in the contract:\\\\n\\\\u201cNo payments or certificate, final or otherwise, shall be construed to relieve the contractor from his obligation to make good any defects arising or discovered in his work within six months after the completion and acceptance of the same.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe discovery of the defect was made within the six months\\\\u2019 period, and within that time a demand was made upon the builder to repair it, with which demand there was no compliance.\\\\nThe specifications provided:\\\\n\\\\u201cThe roofing contractor shall give a satisfactory written guarantee on the roof, guaranteeing same for the period of ten years against leaks, and keeping the same in repair during the ten years.\\\\u201d\\\\nAs a compliance with this clause of the specifications the builder procured a letter from the corporation to whom he had let a subcontract for installing the roof, in which the subcontractor agreed to maintain the roofing installed by them for a period of ten years. The recited conditions were:\\\\n\\\\u201cThis agreement relates only to the material and workmanship furnished by us, and will be fulfilled by repairing free of charge any leaks resulting\\\\u2019 from defects in such material or workmanship. This maintenance agreement is issued to Peder P. Gjarde of Seattle, Wash., and refers to approximately lOb^ squares of roofing completed on the 5th day of June, 1922, on a building located on Lot 12 and south 20 feet of Lot 11, Block 11, Nagles Addition to the City of Seattle, known as the DeHoney Dancing Academy building.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis letter was forwarded to the plaintiffs and retained by them. The defendants requested the court to charge the jury that the \\\\u201cletter constituted a sufficient and satisfactory guarantee and complied with the terms of the specifications,\\\\u201d and that \\\\u201cthe liability of the defendants in this case is limited to the fair and reasonable costs in putting the roof in satisfactory condition, if you find that it was leaky or defective, . . . and you cannot award\\\\u201d the plaintiffs \\\\u201cdamages for any injuries to their building, its floors, walls or contents.\\\\u201d The court declined to give the instruction and error is assigned thereon. Were this an action based upon the special warranty set forth, possibly the rule for which the defendants contend might be applicable. But this is not such an action. It is an action based upon the building contract as an entirety, of which this warranty is only a part. The question is not, therefore, was there a breach of the warranty, but is rather, was there a breach of the building contract. In such an action the measure of damages is the amount of damages which naturally result or flow from the breach complained of, and which were contemplated by the parties as a probable consequence of the breach. School District No. 172 v. Josenhans, 88 Wash. 624, 153 Pac. 326. There can, we think, be no question that a breach of that part of the contract relating to the construction of the roof, if the breach was of such a nature as to cause it to leak water in quantities such as was shown here, would materially damage the interior of the building as well as the contents of the building. There can, therefore, be a recovery of the damages ensuing from the breach, re.gardless of the terms of the special contract to keep the roof in repair.\\\\nThe sixth assignment of error relates to the evidence introduced to show a loss of profits. It will be remembered that the court, during the course of the trial, withdrew this item of damage from the consideration of the jury and instructed the jury not to consider the evidence relating thereto. At this stage of the proceedings the plaintiffs had introduced a considerable part of their evidence on the subject, and it is contended that, notwithstanding the withdrawal of the item from the consideration of the jury and the instruction given, the prejudicial effect of the evidence was not thereby cured. But we see nothing unusual in this circumstance. In the trial of causes it frequently happens that the court must, from the nature of the case, admit evidence on subjects which he must afterwards withdraw from the consideration of the jury, aud if this must in every case require the trial court to discharge the jury then empaneled and commence over again, \\\\u201cthere will,\\\\u201d as we said in Bayers v. Barry, 114 Wash. 252, 194 Pac. 993, \\\\u201cbe no end to law suits.\\\\u201d But the rule is not thus stringent. In the early case of Lyts v. Keevey, 5 Wash. 606, 32 Pac. 534, we said we were not disposed to adopt the rule that evidence improperly admitted cannot be counteracted in the subsequent course of the trial by instructions withdrawing its consideration from the jury. This rule we have followed in many subsequent cases. See: Wilson v. West & Slade Mill Co., 28 Wash. 312, 68 Pac. 716; Yakima Valley Bank v. McAllister, 37 Wash. 566, 79 Pac. 1119, 107 Am. St. 823, 1 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1075; Billings v. Snohomish, 51 Wash. 135, 98 Pac. 107; and the cases collected in the cited cases.\\\\nIn State v. Gay, 82 Wash. 423, 144 Pac. 711, concerning this question, we said:\\\\n\\\\u201cBut it is contended that the evidence was so far prejudicial as to be incapable of cure by its withdrawal from.the consideration of the jury. To this point, the appellant cites State v. Pryor, 67 Wash. 216, 121 Pac. 56. That case, however, was an extreme case. The evidence admitted and subsequently withdrawn had reference to offenses degrading in their nature, in no way connected with the offense upon which the appellant was being prosecuted, and was withdrawn only on condition that the defendant would admit a fact necessary to be shown in order to convict him of the offense with which he was charged. Under these circumstances, the court could well conclude that the act of the court did not remove the prejudice occasioned by the admission of the improper evidence. But it was not \\'therein intended to be held that no error in the admission of improper testimony can be cured by such means, and especially was it not meant to be held that evidence, not objectionable in itself, but improperly admitted because of a circumstance not shown when the testimony was offered, cannot be cured by withdrawing it from the consideration of the jury. The presumption in all cases is that the jury obeyed the instructions of the court, and this presumption must prevail until it is overcome by some showing that the fact is otherwise. To withdraw evidence subsequently discovered to be improperly admitted is a common practice in criminal as well as in civil causes, and the procedure is generally held to cure any error caused by its improper admission. State v. Manville, 8 Wash. 523, 36 Pac. 470; Yakima Valley Bank v. McAllister, 37 Wash. 566, 79 Pac. 1119, 107 Am. St. 823, 1 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1075. We think in the present case any error committed by the admission of the testimony objected to was cured by its subsequent withdrawal.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis court has held, it is true, in cases other than the case referred to in the last cited case, that, there are circumstances where the prejudicial effect of improper evidence is not removed by instructions to disregard it, but it will be found from an examination of the cases that they present circumstances differentiating them from the general rule, matters not present in the case now before us.\\\\nThe account book of the plaintiffs showing their receipts and disbursements in the operation of the building prior to and during the time the leakage from the roof occurred, was admitted in evidence as tending to prove loss of profits. When this item of damage was withdrawn from the jury the book as evidence was also stricken. By some inadvertence, however, it was sent to the jury room along with the exhibits in the cause. The affidavits of the jurors submitted show that the book was not examined by the jurors until after they had agreed upon a verdict, when some member of the jury read certain items therefrom. As the book related to matters which the court had instructed them were not for their consideration, it is difficult to see wherein it could have a prejudicial effect even-had it been examined by the jury. But conceding that prejudice under that circumstance might he presumed, the fact shown precludes error. The rule is thus stated in Thompson on Trials, \\\\u00a7 2590:\\\\n\\\\u201cIf the paper was taken out by mistake, and not by the fraud or design of the prevailing party, or his counsel, and if it was not in fact read by the jury, then there is no occasion to grant a new trial; since no harm has been done to the party against whom the verdict was rendered, and the other party has done no wrong for which he is to be punished. And the rule is the same where it is made to appear that the only jurors who read the objectionable paper had already agreed to return the verdict which was rendered. As the affidavits of jurors are generally admissible to sustain their verdicts, it may be shown by such evidence that the paper was not in fact read by any of the jury.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\u25a0 Here the book went to the jury by mistake, and not by fraud or design of the prevailing parties or their counsel. Nor was it considered by the jury. Hence, in the language of the authority cited, \\\\u201cno harm has been done to the party against whom the verdict was rendered. \\\\u2019 \\\\u2019\\\\nThe plaintiffs\\\\u2019 witness Kubat was permitted, over the objection of the defendants, to testify to the damage to a piano in the building caused by moisture. The objection was based on the ground that he had not shown sufficient qualifications. Frbm his testimony it appears that he had had twenty years\\\\u2019 experience as a piano tuner, that he had been in the wholesale and retail trade of pianos for fifteen years, that he was familiar with prices of pianos in Seattle, and had done much work on the piano in question. At the time he was testifying he could not recall the make of the piano, but testified that it was a baby grand, a brand new instrument, and that the damage was to the strings, the pads, and the sounding board; the latter injury causing the principal damage. In our opinion, he was qualified to testify. The weight to be given to his testimony was, of course, for the jury, but its admission neither requires a reversal nor the deduction of this item of damage from the amount of the verdict.\\\\nCertain witnesses were called by the plaintiffs on rebuttal, and it is objected that their testimony is not proper rebuttal. These objections we shall not notice in detail, as we can see no such prejudice as would require a reversal, even were the objections well taken. But, more than this, we cannot conclude that the objections are well taken.\\\\nThe remaining assignments relate to the instructions of the court to the jury. There were requests for instructions which the trial court refused to give, and there were instructions to which the defendants excepted. In the main, they involve the question of the proper construction of the contract. These in part we have hereinbefore adverted, in which we have declined to follow the construction of the defendants, and have followed that of the trial court. These require no further discussion. Those not heretofore involved will be briefly noticed. The defendants requested the following instruction:\\\\n\\\\u201cI instruct you that by the express terms of the contract in evidence in this case, the architect, Louis Svarz, was the agent of the owner, J. H. DeHoney, and as such had authority to represent and bind the owner by all of his directions and orders to the defendant Gjarde.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe court, on the subject-matter, gave the following:\\\\n\\\\u201cI instruct you that by the express terms of the contract in evidence in this case, the architect, Louis Svarz, was the agent of the owner, J. H. DeHoney, and as such had authority to represent and bind the owner by all of his directions and orders to the defendant Gjarde\\', in so far as the quality of the materials-and workmanship were concerned, but not as to any material deviation from the plans and specifications.\\\\n\\\\u201cYou are instructed that it is provided in said contract and specifications that no alterations shall be made in the work shown or described by drawings and specifications, except upon the written order of the architect; that no deviation from the drawings or specifications shall be made in the execution of the work without the written approval of the architect; that no verbal statement of any person whomsoever shall be allowed in any manner or degree to modify or otherwise affect the terms of the contract of specifications, and that changes shall be made only and strictly according to contract.\\\\u201d\\\\nIn its instructions the court but followed the provisions of the contract. There was elsewhere in the contract, it is true, recitals to the effect that the architect was the agent of the owner, and that his interpretation of the contract should be final, but these provisions referred to instances of repugnant provisions of the contract, or to instances where the contract did not speak; it gave the architect no- power to- modify provisions capable of but one interpretation. As we said in Dyer v. Middle Kittitas Irr. Dist., 40 Wash. 238, 82 Pac. 301:\\\\n\\\\u201cThe contract provides that the engineer shall define the meaning, intent, and purport of the plans and specifications, and that his decision in all cases shall be final; but this, it is plain, refers to the interpretation of doubtful and uncertain terms of the contract, not to the question of law presented by the language of the contract or specifications. This clause does not confer upon the engineer the power to vary the meaning of plain terms used in the contract, for if this were so, there would be no need of the writing, as the engineer\\\\u2019s arbitrary assertion would be all-sufficient.\\\\u201d\\\\nSee, also: Hurley v. Kiona-Benton School Dist., No. 27, 124 Wash. 537, 215 Pac. 21; Mercantile Trust Co. v. Hensey, 205 U. S. 298.\\\\nThe trial court further on in its instructions quoted certain of the provisions of the contract relating to the manner of constructing the roof, and instructed the jury that even though they should find that the defendant Grjarde had the roofing work done by a subcontractor, he would nevertheless be under obligation to see that there was no deviation from the contract. The defendant objects to this for the reason that it amounted to an instruction that the defendant was obligated \\\\u201cto see that the base flashing was turned up 18 inches, which was the pivot of the whole case.\\\\u201d \\\\u2022 In our opinion, the instruction was correct, even though it be so construed. As we have before indicated, the fact being admitted that there was not a compliance with the contract with reference to the construction of the roof in the respect stated, it followed as matter of law that there was a breach of the contract, for which the defendant was liable in damages for the injury that arose from the breach. Error, therefore, cannot be predicated on an instruction so stating.\\\\nTurning to the plaintiffs\\\\u2019 appeal, we find no error in the ruling of the court withdrawing from the consideration of the jury the question of loss of profits. True, this court is committed to the rule that loss of profits may be recovered, but we have said that the loss must be shown with a reasonable degree of accuracy, and that the testimony establishing the loss must be clear and free from taint of speculation or conjecture.

W. Cordes, Respondent, v. Guy Investment Company, Appellant.\"],\"opinions\":[{\"text\":\"Parker, J.\\\\nThe plaintiff, Cordes, seeks recovery of damages, claimed as the result of the failure of his landlord, the defendant investment company, to keep in repair the roof of the building occupied by him as a tenant of the building, as required by a covenant of the lease. Trial upon the merits, in the superior court for King county sitting without a jury, resulted in findings and judgment awarding to plaintiff recovery in the snm of $573. From this disposition of the case, the defendant has appealed to this court, and thereafter the plaintiff cross-appealed to this court, claiming the amount of the award to be inadequate under the evidence.\\\\nThe plaintiff, at all times in question, was a dealer in electrical and mechanical machinery in Seattle. On February 16,1925, the plaintiff leased from the defendant investment company the south half of its building situated on lot 6, block 315, Seattle Tidelands Addition, the space so leased being approximately thirty by one hundred fifty feet in area. The written lease contained, among other stipulations, the following:\\\\n\\\\u201cThe lessee shall not use said premises for any other purpose than that of a general machinery manufacturing, storage and sales business. . . . Necessary repairs to roof, walls or foundation are the concern of the lessor. . . . It is hereby agreed that lessor will guarantee to lessee the quiet, peaceful and uninterrupted possession of said premises for the full term of this lease.\\\\u201d\\\\nSoon after the execution of the lease, the plaintiff commenced the occupancy of the leased space, and thereafter carried on his business therein as contemplated by the terms of the lease. About March 10, 1925, the roof of the building commenced to leak and showed signs of being seriously out of repair, the leakage threatening to seriously damage the plaintiff\\\\u2019s goods. He then notified defendant\\\\u2019s agent, requesting repair of the roof, and obtained a promise of proper repair being- made.\\\\nSome two weeks later, plaintiff received 1,500 pounds of steel piano wire which he had bought and contracted to sell a customer for six hundred dollars, having received a cash deposit of one hundred dollars on such contracted sale. Soon thereafter, while the wire was stored in the leased space of the building, leakage through the roof so wet and damaged the wire as to seriously damage it to the extent that it became, without fault of the plaintiff, of practically no value, and. could be sold for the price of only twenty-seven dollars, rendering, it necessary for the contract for the sale of the wire by the plaintiff to be rescinded and his returning to the purchaser the one hundred dollars deposit. The wire, if undamaged, was of the value of at least six hundred dollars. Indeed, its market value was shown to be considerably more than six hundred dollars, but the court awarded to the plaintiff only five hundred and seventy-three dollars, because that was his actual loss, in view of his previous sale contract with his customer. It is this award of which the defendant here complains upon its appeal.\\\\nThe plaintiff claims further damages by reason of the continued leaking of the roof; claiming that, to safely protect certain of his other goods, he was compelled to rent storage space therefor elsewhere; seeking to have his alleged damage on that account measured by the amount of storage rent he was compelled to pay for storage elsewhere. The refusal of the court to make any additional award to the plaintiff on account of this claimed damage is the basis of the plaintiff\\\\u2019s complaint, here made upon his appeal.\\\\nCounsel for the defendant invoke the general rule, as stated in Jones on Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a7 589, that\\\\n\\\\u201cObligation to repair cannot be placed on the landlord without clear and specific language to that effect; such a duty cannot be raised by inference;\\\\u201d\\\\nand argue that the lease does not contain language clearly evidencing a covenant on the part of the defendant to keep the roof in repair. It seems to us that the words \\\\u201cnecessary repairs to roof . . . are the concern of the lessor,\\\\u201d especially when read in the light of the other above quoted stipulations of the lease, do plainly evidence such a covenant. The contemplated use of the space by the plaintiff was clearly understood and agreed upon, and it was manifestly that use that was guaranteed to be \\\\u201cuninterrupted,\\\\u201d meaning, we think, such safely uninterrupted use as contemplated. A further consideration, lending support to this view, is that it appears from the evidence that, in the negotiations leading up to the making of the lease, the defendant\\\\u2019s agent assured the plaintiff that the roof was in good condition.\\\\nContention is made in behalf of the defendant that the evidence does not warrant the conclusions that the damage to the wire was caused by the leaking of the roof; that, if that was the cause of the damage, the defendant did not have timely notice of the defect in the roof; and that the damage, if any, was the result of the plaintiff\\\\u2019s negligence, in that he could, by proper care, have so placed the wire in the leased space as to cause it to escape such damage. These contentions present only questions of fact, and a careful reading of the evidence convinces us that it does not preponderate against the trial court\\\\u2019s findings and conclusions.\\\\nContention is made in behalf of the defendant that, in any event, the plaintiff\\\\u2019s measure of damages would be only the difference between the rental value of the space and the amount that value was depreciated by the leaking condition of the roof, -as to which there was no evidence. We do not think that the plaintiff was confined to such measure of damages. In Miller v. Sullivan, 77 Kan. 252, 94 Pac. 266, 16 L. R. A. (N. S.) 737, we find a well considered case, in substance like the one before us, wherein the holding is clearly opposed to this contention. Our own decision in Kohne v. White, 12 Wash. 199, 40 Pac. 794, is in harmony with this conclusion, though the particular question does not seem to have been there very elaborately argued. We conclude that there was no error in the court\\\\u2019s adoption of this measure of damages.\\\\nIt is contended, in behalf of the plaintiff upon his appeal, that he should have been awarded additional damages, for rent paid by him for necessary storage of certain of his other goods elsewhere because of the continued leaking of the roof. We cannot see that the evidence preponderates in showing such necessity upon his part. This contention presents, as we view it, only a question of fact, as to which we think the evidence does not preponderate against the judgment.\\\\nThe judgment is affirmed. Both parties having, as appellants, wholly failed, neither will recover costs as against the other incurred in this court.\\\\nMackintosh, O.

The City of Tacoma, Respondent.\"],\"opinions\":[{\"text\":\"French, J.\\\\nThis is an action for damages claimed to have been suffered by appellants by reason of the fact that the main sewer to which their property was connect\\\\u00e9d became clogged or overtaxed causing the sewage to be deposited upon their property. The facts are as follows:\\\\nAppellants are the owners of certain premises on South Park avenue in Tacoma. In 1927 they built a new house on these premises with a basement seven and a half feet deep. By means of a connection run from their basement, they were joined to the sewer running through an alley some sixty feet distant from their house, there being a drop of some four or five feet between the basement and the alley. It is conceded that this sewer connection was required by the city under the terms of a city ordinance, and it is also conceded that the connection as made in every way conformed to the ordinance, and was approved by the proper inspectors of the city.\\\\nOn Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 1927, appellants having in the meantime moved into the property and occupying it as their home, this eight-inch main sanitary sewer became either clogged by some obstruction therein or overtaxed to such an extent that the sewage was forced back through the drain pipes of appellants into their basement covering the floor of the basement to a depth of approximately four feet. This occurred from time to time on some three or four occasions prior to April 3, 1928. By reason thereof appellants suffered substantial damage, not only by reason of the fact that many articles stored in the basement were destroyed, but also by reason of the fact that the premises became extremely foul and unsanitary, the uncontradicted testimony tending to show that the damages aggregated a considerable amount.\\\\nThis action being commenced, the city denied negligence, and alleged contributory negligence, but no evidence of any kind was introduced tending to show any contributory negligence on the part of appellants. The eight-inch sanitary sewer which served the property of appellants and with which they were required to connect had been installed approximately twenty years prior to the time of the flooding of the premises. At the time of its installation, it was undoubtedly of ample size to serve all of the residents in the vicinity which it was expected to serve. However, by reason of the growth of the territory, it had become inadequate.\\\\nThe city also alleged that the flooding of this property at this particular time had been by reason of sudden, unexpected and excessive rainfall, but the evidence tends to show that the normal rainfall for the month of November was 6.59 inches, and that during that month 7.95 inches of rain actually fell. The rainfall during the months of January, February and March, the months during which the other floodings occurred, was considerably below normal.\\\\nThe evidence introduced on behalf of the city also tends to show that inspectors were constantly watching this sewer during periods of heavy rainfall and that, at the time of the flooding which took place on Thanksgiving Day, the sewer was running to its full capacity, although there is evidence in the record showing that something was done to this sewer in March, 1928, and that thereafter there were no floodings.\\\\nThe record in this case clearly indicates that, while there may have been, and probably were, at the times when the basement was actually flooded, rather heavy rains, no extraordinary storm conditions existed. As was heretofore stated, the record conclusively shows that the rainfall for the month of November was slightly above normal, and for the subsequent months considerably below normal.\\\\nThe question* then, is squarely presented, Is the city liable under circumstances such as these for sewage discharged on appellants\\\\u2019 property, they having been compelled by ordinance to connect with the sewer, the connection having been made in the manner approved by the city, and there being no negligence of any kind on their part?\\\\nIt may be conceded at the outset that the authorities are divided on this question, many authorities holding that the city will not be liable for damages caused by the construction of a sewer of insufficient capacity, and others holding that, if the sewer system is not reasonably sufficient to take care of sewage and water reasonably expected to accumulate under ordinary circumstances, the municipality will be liable for resultant damages. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations, Yol. 6, \\\\u00a7 2694.\\\\nOne of the leading cases holding the city liable under circumstances such as those apparent in this case is Tate v. City of St. Paul, 56 Minn. 527, 58 N. W. 158, where the court said:\\\\n\\\\u201cThe action is to recover damages arising from a sewer laid by defendant, and with which plaintiff had connected, as he had a right to do, setting the water in it back so that it flooded plaintiff\\\\u2019s basements. The defect alleged in the sewer was that it was of insufficient capacity to carry off the water brought into it. The defect appears to have existed in the original plan for sewering that part of the city; that is, the city, in determining upon a system of sewers, determined upon the sizes required for the main sewer and for the lateral sewers running into it, and the size determined on for the former proved too small.\\\\n\\\\u201cThe rule is uniformly conceded that for injuries wholly incidental to and consequential upon the exercise by a municipal corporation of the legislative or discretionary powers intrusted to it (as distinguished from its ministerial acts) no action will lie against it. Instances of the application of that rule are furnished by Lee v. City of Minneapolis, 22 Minn. 13, where the power exercised was by establishing the grade of a street under the charter, and Alden v. City of Minneapolis, 24 Minn. 254, where the city had established a system of grades for streets and sidewalks, and drains, gutters, catch-basins and sewers, and had constructed the streets, sidewalks, drains, and gutters, and partially completed the sewers.\\\\n\\\\u201cSome of the earlier cases do not clearly recognize the distinction between injuries incidental to the exercise of municipal legislative functions, and direct and positive wrongs \\\\u2014 such for instance, as trespass \\\\u2014 caused by it. The later and better authorities, however, recognize the distinction, and, while adhering to the rule that for the former no action will lie, hold that for the latter the party may recover. The distinction is apparent, though it is not clearly discussed in either of the cases, of O\\\\u2019Brien v. City of St. Paul, 18 Minn. 176 (Gil. 163), and 25 Minn. 331; Kobs v. City of Minneapolis, 22 Minn. 159; and the Lee and Alden cases, above cited.\\\\n\\\\u201cBut for a direct invasion of one\\\\u2019s right of property, even though contemplated by, or necessarily resulting from, the plan adopted, an action will lie; otherwise, it would be taking private property for public use without compensation. Thus, if, in cutting a street down a grade, the soil of an abutting lot is precipitated into the cut, or if, in filling up to grade, the slope of the embankment is made to rest on private property, that is a direct invasion of property rights which cannot be justified, even though the plan adopted contemplates, or will necessarily produce, the result.\\\\n\\\\u201cJudge Dillon, in his work on Municipal Corporations (4th Ed., \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a71047-1051), approves the rule, laid down in more recent decisions by some of our ablest courts, that if a sewer, whatever its plan, is so constructed as to cause a positive and direct invasion of private property, as by collecting and throwing upon it, to its damage, water or sewage which would not otherwise have flowed or found its way there, the corporation is liable. Conspicuous for their ability, among the cases referred to by him, are Ashley v. Port Huron, 35 Mich. 296, and Seifert v. City of Brooklyn, 101 N. Y. 136, 4 N. E. 321-each, the former, especially, a very interesting case. See, also, Brayton v. Fall River, 113 Mass. 218; Lehn v. City and County of San Francisco, 66 Cal. 76, 4 Pac. 965; Weis v. City of Madison, 75 Ind. 241. It is impossible to answer the reasoning of these cases, especially where the injury complained of constitutes a taking. That making one\\\\u2019s premises a place of deposit for the surplus waters in the sewers in times of high water, or creating a nuisance upon them so as to deprive the owner of the beneficial use of his property, is an appropriation requiring compensation to be made, see Weaver v. Mississippi & R. R. Boom Co., 28 Minn. 534, 11 N. W. 114.\\\\u201d\\\\nThat the city is liable as for trespass, and that building a sewer adequate in size at the time of its construction and lack of actual acts of negligence in its maintenance and operation, is no defense, see City of Louisville v. Leezer, 143 Ky. 244, 136 S. W. 223, where the court stated:\\\\n\\\\u201cUnder these authorities and others that might be cited, we think it may be regarded as fully established in this jurisdiction that when a municipal corporation undertakes to establish a system of sewers it must make provision for the increase that may naturally and reasonably be expected in the population of the city. The fact that the sewers when first constructed were adequate to meet the demands of conditions then existing will not relieve the city from responsibility if by growth and population they become inadequate for the use they were intended to supply. . . . The question is not whether the improvement was sufficient when it was built, but is \\\\u2014 was it adequate when the injury complained of occurred. It results from these views that the principal defense relied on by the city is not tenable.\\\\u201d\\\\nTo the same general effect, see, Weis v. City of Madison, 75 Ind. 241; Seaman v. City of Marshall, 116 Mich. 327, 74 N. W. 484; Lewenthal v. Mayor, etc., of New York, 61 Barb. (N. Y.) 511; City of Dixon v. Baker, 65 Ill. 519.\\\\nThat this court has indicated it will follow the more liberal rule as announced by these cases, see Lennon v. Seattle, 69 Wash. 447, 125 Pac. 770, a case where damages were obtained by reason of the breaking of a sewer and the resultant flooding of property by sewage. This court quoted with approval from certain cases as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cIn Ashley v. Port Huron, 35 Mich. 296, 24 Am. Rep. 552, a well-considered case, in which damage to private property was occasioned by a sewer, Judge Cooley, after citing and discussing numerous decisions, well said:\\\\n\\\\u201c \\\\u2018It is very manifest from the reference to authorities that they recognize in municipal corporations no exemption from responsibility where the injury an individual has received is a direct injury accomplished by a corporate act which is in the nature of a trespass upon him. The right of an individual to the occupation and enjoyment of his prerais\\\\u00e9s is exclusive, and the public authorities have no more liberty to trespass upon it than has a private individual. If the corporation send people with picks and spades to cut a street through it without first acquiring the right of way, it is liable for a tort; but it is no more liable under such circumstances than it is when it pours upon his land a flood of water by a public sewer so constructed that the flooding must be a necessary result. The one is no more unjustifiable and no more an actionable wrong, than the other. Each is a trespass, and in each instance the city exceeds its lawful jurisdiction. A municipal charter never gives and never could give authority to appropriate the freehold of a citizen without compensation, whether it is done through an actual taking of it for streets or buildings, or by flooding it so as to interfere with the owner\\\\u2019s possession. His property right is appropriated in the one case as much 81S 111 th.6 otllBlT, *\\\\n\\\\u201cIn Roberts v. Dover, 72 N. H. 147, 153, 55 Atl. 895, a sewer case, the court, discussing the duties and liabilities of a municipal corporation, said:\\\\n\\\\u201c In Rowe v. Portsmouth, 56 N. H. 291, it was held that in maintaining a public sewer a city is bound to use that degree of care and prudence which a discreet and cautious individual would use if the whole loss or risk was to be his alone. The case renders unnecessary a discussion of the liability of a city or town, which builds a sewer under legislative authority, for defects in the plan adopted. When, having constructed a sewer, it connects it with other sewers and drains, overtaxing its capacity, and allows insoluble materials to accumulate in it and obstruct the flow of water, causing it to flow back upon private property, its liability for the resulting damage does not differ from that of an individual, who so unreasonably manages his property as to cause damage to the adjoining property of his neighbor. The fact that it is a public corporation, performing certain public duties, does not exempt it from liability for negligence when performing a work not imposed upon it as a public agent, but voluntarily assumed by it under a legislative license. Having undertaken the construction and management of a system of sewerage for the local accommodation and convenience, its duties to individuals liable to be damaged thereby is measured by the same rule of ordinary care and prudence under the circumstances as would be applied if it were a private business corporation, partnership, or individual engaged in the same work. \\\\u2019\\\\n\\\\u201cIn King v. Kansas City, 58 Kan. 334, 49 Pac. 88, the court said:\\\\n\\\\u201c \\\\u2018The city cannot without liability collect sewage and filth and precipitate it upon the property of a citizen, even if the plan is devised in good faith and the best material is used in the construction. It is immaterial from which end of the sewer the discharge is made; the consequence and liability are necessarily the same. \\\\u201cCourts of the highest respectability have held that if the sewer, whatever its plan, is so constructed by the municipal authorities as to cause a positive and direct invasion of the plaintiff\\\\u2019s private property by collecting and throwing upon it to his damage water or sewage which would not otherwise have flowed or found its way there, the corporation is liable.\\\\u201d 2 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (4th ed.), \\\\u00a7 1047. See, also, Ashley v. Port Huron, 35 Mich. 296; Tate v. St. Paul, 56 Minn. 527; Seifert v. City of Brooklyn, 101 N. Y. 136; Lehn v. San Francisco, 66 Cal. 76; North Vernon v. Vogler, 89 Ind. 77; Orange v. Field, 37 N. J. Eq. 600.\\\\u2019 \\\\u201d\\\\nIt is true that in other cases from this court statements have been made by way of argument which indicate that the contrary rule might be followed. See Vittucci Importing Co. v. Seattle, 72 Wash. 192, 130 Pac. 109. But the statements therein contained are not necessary to a decision of the case. The theory of all of the cases which we have examined, which hold the city liable under circumstances such as we have outlined above, seems to be that the property owner is required to connect with the sewer; that he is not permitted to dispose of his sewage in any other way than the one way provided by the city; that he has no power or authority to remove the cause, or to in any way remedy the defect from which his injury arises; that the city alone has the power and the means to remedy the defective sewer or to replace an inadequate sewer, and that no person should be required to suffer an injury caused by an agency over which he has no control and over which the city has absolute control, and that if an injury is inflicted by such an agency he should be properly compensated therefor. \\\\\"We think this is the better rule and is well supported by both reason and authority.\\\\nReversed for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\\\\nMitchell, C.

The city has appealed, assigning error to all of the material findings and conclusions.\\\\nThe testimony showed that the home now owned by the plaintiff was built in the year 1911 over a gully or ravine, which is the east branch of Sylvia creek and is a natural drainage for certain portions of the city of Montesano. In the year 1913, the city of Montesano embarked upon a street building program whereby the grade of certain streets was brought up to level and new streets were constructed. Included in this project was Seventh street, which crossed this branch of Sylvia creek fifty feet east of the plaintiff\\\\u2019s property, which was then owned by one Mitchell Zvono. One lot intervened between this property and Seventh street. We will refer to this lot hereafter as the Bogdanovich property and to the plaintiff\\\\u2019s property as the Papac property.\\\\nIn grading Seventh street, the city placed a tile drain pipe in the creek bed and filled the ravine to bring the street up to level. The fill was extended over the Bogdanovich property; and apparently some fill was also placed on the Papac property, although there was no direct evidence that this was done by the city. The then owner of the Bogdanovich property placed a tile drain, or culvert, under the fill, connecting with the city\\\\u2019s culvert at Seventh street.\\\\nIn its street improvement program, the city graded Fourth street three blocks east of Seventh. Mitchell Zvono testified that this increased the flow of water into the natural drainage of the east branch of Sylvia creek. This testimony was contradicted by an engineer who testified for the defendant. The trial court found that the grading of Fourth street almost doubled the flow of water in the east branch of Sylvia creek.\\\\nWhen the plaintiff\\\\u2019s house was built in 1911, a cedar plank culvert, which was sufficient to take care of the natural flow of water under the house, was built across the Papac property.\\\\nIn 1916, Zvono and Papac, who later became the plaintiff\\\\u2019s husband and is now deceased, left Montesano for Montana and Alaska. When Zvono returned in 1919, he found a large hole in the fill. He complained to the mayor, who referred him to what he described as the \\\\u201cditch committee.\\\\u201d The old culvert was replaced by the city with a culvert made of fir planking, and the hole was filled. In 1933, the city, through a public works project, replaced the fir culvert with two twelve-inch used city water pipes, which were made of wood and wrapped with wire.\\\\nThe Papacs were deeded a one-half interest in the property in 1920, and the remaining interest in 1930.\\\\nSometime between 1946 and 1948, a break occurred in one of the drain pipes. The pipes have since rotted out, and the house has deteriorated rapidly. The planks in the basement (constructed sometime between 1930 and 1940) have rotted, molded, and become termite-ridden, and the house has shifted on its foundation. The evidence regarding the causative factors was conflicting; but the trial court found that the damage was caused by the water overflowing from the rotted drain pipes. There was testimony that during the rainy season the ground is wet under the house, due to the fact that the water flows outside the pipes.\\\\nThe city has no easement across the Papac property. There was no evidence that the work done there was authorized by the city council or that similar work had been done on other private property. Neither was there any evidence that the placing of a drain across the Papac property would benefit the public.\\\\nThe trial court found that the damage in 1919 to the original culvert was due to the fill work and the increased flow of water, and that from that date the city assumed the burden of maintaining the culvert. The court concluded that the city, by allowing diverted drainage waters to flow uncontrolled over the plaintiff\\\\u2019s land, is maintaining a public nuisance, which should be abated. It ordered the abatement of the nuisance either by the construction of adequate drainage across the plaintiff\\\\u2019s property or by diverting the flow of water away from the property.\\\\nThere is no question but that the gully over which the plaintiff\\\\u2019s predecessor built his house is a natural drainage system, and there is nothing in the record to support the trial court\\\\u2019s finding that the flow of water in this gully was almost doubled by the grading of Fourth street. An engineer called by the defendant testified that the land east of Fourth street is lower than the grade of the street and that water would tend to drain east of the street as well as west. Zvono testified that there had always been drainage from east of Fourth street, but that it had increased after the street was graded. He did not attempt to say how much the flow had increased. There was no evidence that the increased flow would tend to cause a wooden culvert to rot. On the other hand, there was testimony by several witnesses for both parties that rotting is caused by the alternate moistening and drying out of wood, a condition which occurs as a result of the wet and dry seasons. We will assume, however, that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the flow of water was substantially increased and that it caused the wooden pipes to deteriorate more rapidly than they otherwise would have. The defendant maintains that the plaintiff\\\\u2019s cause of action for such damage is barred by the statute of limitations.\\\\nWhere property is taken or damaged in the exercise of the power of eminent domain, the three-year statute of limitations applies. Gillam v. Centralia, 14 Wn. (2d) 523, 128 P. (2d) 661. The damaging of land by the construction of a street or highway, causing it to be flooded by surface waters, is a taking and damaging, within the meaning of Art. I, \\\\u00a7 16 (amendment 9) of the constitution. Harkoff v. Whatcom County, 40 Wn. (2d) 147, 241 P. (2d) 932; Ulery v. Kitsap County, 188 Wash. 519, 63 P. (2d) 352. The period of limitation begins to run when the project causing the damage is completed if substantial damage has already occurred (Gillam v. Centralia, supra), or when the first substantial injury is sustained. See Jacobs v. Seattle, 100 Wash. 524, 171 Pac. 662. If the injury is permanent, the measure of damages is generally the difference between the market value of the property immediately before, and immediately after, the damage; if it is temporary, the measure of damages is generally the cost of reconstruction, with compensation for loss of use in a proper case. Harkoff v. Whatcom County, supra.\\\\nIt is apparent that the first substantial damage, occasioned by the regrading of Fourth street and the placing of the fill on the Papac property, occurred sometime prior to 1919. Whether the placing of the fill be regarded as a tortious invasion (in which case the three-year statute would apply, under the provisions of Rem. Rev. Stat. (Sup.), \\\\u00a7 159 [cf. RCW 4.16.080]) or a taking or damaging under the power of eminent domain, any cause of action based thereon is long since barred. Furthermore, it appears from the testimony of the plaintiff\\\\u2019s predecessor in title, Zvono, that any damage resulting from these actions was compromised and settled when the city replaced the pipe and restored the fill, and this work was accepted as satisfactory.\\\\nIf the plaintiff has a cause of action against the city now, it must be based upon an undertaking by the city to maintain the drain pipes across the Papac property. It was upon this theory that the trial court acted when it awarded the damages claimed by the plaintiff.\\\\nIn this regard, it must be borne in mind that this is not a case where it is claimed that the city has dammed up, or obstructed, the natural flow of water. The witnesses testified that the water flows freely through the culvert under Seventh street and the tile, or concrete, culvert constructed by the adjoining owners on their property. The complaint is that the wooden pipes which the city placed across the Papac property in 1933 (as a replacement of the deteriorated wooden culvert placed there by the city in 1919, which replaced the original culvert built by the owner)\\' have deteriorated and broken down, so that the water flows through its natural course outside the pipes rather than inside them, with the result that the timbers of the house are exposed to the flowing water.\\\\nCases such as Ronkosky v. Tacoma, 71 Wash. 148,128 Pac. 2, cited by the plaintiff, are therefore not in point. The Ronkosky case dealt with the liability of \\\\u00e1 city which had caused a culvert and fill to be constructed on one of its streets and had allowed the culvert to become obstructed, causing the plaintiff\\\\u2019s property to be flooded and destroyed. We held that where a street is improved across a natural water course, it is incumbent upon the municipality not only to make an adequate bridge culvert or passage for the water in the first instance, but to keep it in such condition that it shall not obstruct the stream thereafter. It was this duty which the city of Montesano performed when it improved Seventh street, placed the culvert beneath it to carry the natural flow of water, and kept the culvert free of obstruction.\\\\nThe plaintiff urges that the rule stated in 38 Am. Jur. 342, \\\\u00a7 637, is applicable here. This section reads:\\\\n\\\\u201cIn the application of the principles governing municipal liability for injuries resulting from defects or obstructions in sewers, discussed in the preceding section, it is immaterial whether the actual construction of the sewer was done by the municipality or by a private individual, if it is under control of the municipality at the time. Moreover, the municipality is liable regardless of where the sewer is constructed, whether upon municipal property or private property., The fact that the particular drain may be a natural watercourse rather than an artificial construction does not alter the rule of municipal liability for damage resulting from obstructions, so long as the sewer or drain has been adopted by the municipality for drainage purposes and it has assumed control over it. The fact that the damage results from an extraordinary rainfall does not relieve the municipality from liability if the damage would not have resulted but for the obstruction, or if the obstruction contributed to the injury.\\\\u201d (Italics ours.)\\\\nCity of Fort Wayne v. Coombs, 107 Ind. 75, 7 N. E. 743, 57 Am. Rep. 82, is cited as authority for the italicized portion of the above quotation. The court held in that case that the city was within its rights when it constructed a sewer under its highway, even though the highway crossed a privately-owned canal; and the city was liable for its negligence in constructing the sewer.\\\\nThe drainage system involved in this action is not upon a public highway, and the city has acquired no easement across the private property involved. In her testimony, the plaintiff made it plain that she had refused to allow the city to replace the culvert until it had paid her damages, certainly an indication that she did not regard the culvert as being under the control of the city.\\\\nThe laying of the culvert underneath Seventh street was, of course, necessary to the improvement of the street, but it did not constitute an adoption of the natural waterway as a municipal drainage system. The record is silent as to the circumstances attending the laying of the pipes on the Papac property in 1933, and there is nothing to indicate that it was done as a part of a general improvement of the natural drainage system. This case is therefore distinguishable from the Indiana case cited in 38 Am. Jur., supra.\\\\nLikewise, the cases cited in 18 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d. ed.), 467, \\\\u00a7 53.118\\' (in support of the author\\\\u2019s statement that where a municipality assumes control and management of a sewer or drainage system, it is immaterial by whom the system was constructed) involve facts very different from those we are dealing with here and cannot control our decision.\\\\nThis court has held that the power given to cities by statute (RCW 35.21.090, Rem. Rev. Stat., \\\\u00a7 9355), to construct dikes or improve natural water courses, is confined to public purposes; and a city is not authorized to put in a culvert on private property to keep open a nonnavigable natural watercourse which has become obstructed by private culverts and the failure of private owners to properly maintain the same. Wiley v. Aberdeen, 123 Wash. 539, 212 Pac. 1049. Here, as in that case, no public purpose was shown. The plaintiff merely contends that by placing the culvert on her property, the city assumed the duty of maintaining it. No authority is offered for this proposition. Wiley v. Aberdeen is directly contrary, as is Woodward v. Seattle, 140 Wash. 83, 248 Pac. 73, wherein we held that a city is not liable for injuries resulting from an ultra vires act, that is, for an act performed outside the scope of its statutory authority.\\\\nThe plaintiff cites Sigurdson v. Seattle, 48 Wn. (2d) 155, 292 P. (2d) 214, as controlling the issue presented here. In the Sigurdson case, a drain had been constructed on county property by the WPA, and its maintenance had been assumed by the city. A break occurred in the drain, above the plaintiff\\\\u2019s property, causing the hillside on which it was located to become saturated with water, which resulted in a landslide that severely damaged the plaintiff\\\\u2019s property. We held that the drain was maintained for a public purpose, since without it the area constituted a hazard to the city streets; that if any private benefit resulted from the maintenance of the drain, it was only incidental, and distingished \\'Wiley v. Aberdeen, supra, on that ground. While we also stated that in the Wiley case, the city had never maintained the culvert in question, it was not on this distinction that the case was decided. We assumed that the city was authorized to maintain the drain on county property. Sigurdson v. Seattle is not authority for the proposition that a city, by maintaining a drain on private property for a private benefit, may become liable to the property owner for damage resulting from defects in, or the failure to maintain, the drain.\\\\nSo far as the record reveals, the improvements which the city placed upon the Papac property in 1919 and those placed there in 1933 were undertaken gratuitously. In neither case could the act of installing them result in a liability to maintain them, when they were neither authorized by official action nor installed for a public purpose.\\\\nThe judgment is reversed and the mandatory injunction dissolved.\\\\nOtt, Mallery, Hill, and Weaver, JJ., concur.\\\\nJanuary 17, 1957.

Sometime after the commencement of the action, but prior to the time of the trial, the lessors repaired and also repainted the building, and at the hearing before the superior court the lessee conceded that his claim for specific performance had been fully satisfied. The trial therefore proceeded upon the issue of damages alleged to have been sustained by the lessee because of the lessors\\\\u2019 earlier breach of the covenant, in that they had not made the repairs sooner than they did. At the conclusion of the trial, and after taking the cause under advisement, the trial court rendered a memorandum opinion and subsequently entered judgment dismissing the action, but without costs to either party. The plaintiff lessee appealed.\\\\nRespondent lessors are the owners of certain premises situated at the junction of three highways near the city of Renton. On August 16, 1939, they leased the premises, including the building thereon and the equipment therein, to the appellant for use as a restaurant, tavern, and dance hall, for a term of three years beginning October 1, 1939, at a rental of ninety dollars a month. The lease provided that its term of existence could be extended for an additional three-year period at the option of the lessee, on the basis of a monthly rental to be agreed upon by the parties at the end of the original term, and in case of their inability to agree upon the amount of such rental it was to be determined by a committee of three arbitrators.\\\\nThe lease contained a covenant reading as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is further hereby agreed that the lessors shall keep the exterior of the building, namely roof and walls, in proper condition with necessary painting and will also be responsible for any repairs needed in the sewer connections of the said building.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe front wall and one side wall of the building were of stucco composition and the rest of the building presumably was of the ordinary frame construction. The roof was flat, covered with an asphalt top, and was surrounded on three sides by fire walls.\\\\nAt the end of the original three-year term, appellant elected to take an extension of three additional years as provided in the lease, but the parties were unable to agree upon the amount of the monthly rental for the extension period. Respondents were demanding that the rent be increased to one hundred fifty dollars a month; appellant was insisting that it be reduced to fifty dollars. Appellant was operating the place at that time simply as a tavern and dance hall, where beer, wine, and soft drinks were sold and where dances were held two nights a week, but no meals were then being served. It appears also that for some time past appellant had been complaining that the roof of the building leaked and that the exterior needed painting.\\\\nThe parties being unable to come to any satisfactory agreement, three arbitrators were selected, in the manner provided in the lease, to determine the amount of the monthly rental to be charged during the period of the extension. After an inspection of the building, conferences with the respective parties, and a consultation among themselves, the arbitrators made a written report fixing the amount of such rental at one hundred dollars a month. In their report the arbitrators also expressed the view that the lessors had not fully complied with their obligations to the lessee and recommended \\\\u201cthat the landlord fix up the building better than he has in the past; that is fix the roof; and keep the place in repairs.\\\\u201d It appears, however, that shortly before the arbitrators made their report, respondents had put a new asphalt covering on the roof at an expense of one hundred dollars, although they had not done anything in the way of painting during the entire term of the lease.\\\\nPursuant to the report of the arbitrators, the lease was extended and appellant periodically paid the increased rental of one hundred dollars a month. He continued to make complaint, however, regarding the condition of the roof and exterior walls of the building, and respondents endeavored from time to time to make the roof watertight, but did not immediately paint the exterior. Considerable ill-feeling thus seems to have been engendered between the parties, culminating in the institution of this action by the appellant in July, 1943, which was about nine months after the commencement of the extended period of the lease.\\\\nIn his complaint, as amplified by a bill of particulars, appellant alleged that respondents had breached their covenant to repair by allowing the roof of the building to remain in a leaky condition, with the result that in the rainy season water frequently dripped in various spots upon the dance floor and upon the tables in the adjoining booths, to the great discomfort and annoyance of his patrons, and that respondents had further breached their covenant by failing to paint the exterior of the building, in consequence of which the place had a dilapidated appearance, causing many of his customers to discontinue their patronage. The complaint further alleged that the damages resulting from the respondents\\\\u2019 failure to perform the above-mentioned covenant of the lease amounted to \\\\u201capproximately $10.00 per day,\\\\u201d and recovery in that amount was asked. The prayer of the complaint also asked for specific performance of the covenant of the lease. In their answer to the complaint respondents denied in toto appellant\\\\u2019s allegations respecting breach of covenant and consequent damage.\\\\nInasmuch as the action in its inception was a suit in equity for specific performance of the covenant to repair, the trial court was not required to, and did not, make findings of fact. The court did, however, render a memorandum opinion, in which it carefully reviewed and analyzed the evidence and gave a summary of the facts as, in the opinion of the court, they appeared to be established by the evidence. While there is some conflict in the testimony, the material facts are not greatly in dispute. Our view of the factual situation coincides with that expressed by the trial court and may be briefly stated as follows:\\\\nAbout the time of the expiration of the original term of the lease in 1942, a dispute arose between the parties concerning the amount of monthly rent to be charged during the extended term. On account of the outbreak of the present world war and the construction of various government works and other projects in and near Renton, there had been a great influx of people in the immediate vicinity of the premises here involved. For that reason respondents were demanding that the rent for the extended term be increased from ninety dollars a month to one hundred fifty dollars. Appellant, on the other hand, was insisting that the premises were worth not more than fifty dollars a month. Among other reasons given by the appellant for demanding a reduction in rent were the alleged physical condition and appearance of the building. Appellant complained of the shabby appearance of the place due to the fact that the building had not been painted for five or six years. He also complained that the roof leaked in several places, allowing water to drop onto the dance floor and booths at various spots. Respondents endeavored to repair the roof and during the late summer or early fall of 1942 spent about a hundred dollars in that effort, but did not at that time do anything toward having the building painted.\\\\nThe parties being unable to come to any satisfactory agreement, a committee of arbitrators was selected and the matter of rent was submitted to them for decision. After listening to the contentions of both parties and also investigating the premises, the committee on October 13, 1942, made its report fixing the rental for the extended term at one hundred dollars a month and recommending that respondents fix up the building better than they had done in the past, particularly with reference to the roof.\\\\nThroughout the fall and winter of 1942, and the early part of 1943, appellant continued to make complaint that the roof leaked, at times causing water to drip in spots upon the dance floor and upon the tables in the booths. It was testified that on one occasion it was necessary to set out pans to catch the dripping water, and also to move the patrons who were seated at one of the tables to another part of the room. Frequently there were wet spots upon the ceiling and on one of the walls of the building. However, it does not appear that there was ever any actual interruption of appellant\\\\u2019s business, nor was he ever compelled to close the place, even temporarily.\\\\nIn response to appellant\\\\u2019s complaints concerning the roof, respondents endeavored from time to time to remedy the situation. As stated above, just shortly before the arbitrators made their report in October, 1942, respondents had put a new asphalt coating on the roof at an expense of one hundred dollars. Apparently, however, this did not fully terminate the trouble, at least not to the appellant\\\\u2019s entire satisfaction. At any rate he continued to make complaint throughout the latter part of 1942 and the early part of 1943. As these complaints were conveyed to respondent James Zerwoodis, he would visit the premises, most often with one or two assistants, and from the interior of the building would endeavor to locate the place where the roof was leaking. They would then go up onto the roof and make such repairs as seemed necessary in order to correct the situation. After completing the work they would return to the room below to ascertain whether they had succeeded in stopping the leak. This method of attempted repair was carried on many times, particularly during December, 1942, and January, 1943, and apparently with temporary success; but sooner or later another complaint would be made by the appellant. The difficulty seems to have been that of locating the exact place in the roof where the leak, or leaks, originated. The record is replete, however, with\\\\u2019evidence of the respondents\\\\u2019 continuous efforts to satisfy appellant\\\\u2019s complaints with respect to the leaks. There is also considerable evidence in the record from which the trial court could have found, as it seems to have done, that appellant\\\\u2019s complaints were greatly exaggerated.\\\\nAt any rate, sometime in May, 1943, respondents engaged a contractor to inspect and renovate the entire roof and to paint the exterior of the building. The work could not be done, however, and was not done, until about the first of August of that year. In the meantime, appellant had commenced this action.\\\\nIn his memorandum opinion, the trial judge expressed the view that the respondents had carried out the suggestions of the arbitrators with reference to repairs, and had also repainted the building, as soon as weather and labor conditions permitted. A careful reading of the record convinces us that, while some leakage may have persisted during the time when appellant was making complaint thereof, respondents in turn made every reasonable effort to remedy the situation and did in fact accomplish as good results as could have been expected under the circumstances existing during the latter part of 1942 and the early part of 1943. So far as the painting of the exterior is concerned, we are also satisfied that this was undertaken as soon as it could, and should, have been done.\\\\nIn expressing these conclusions, however, we are not to be understood as holding that respondents were not bound by their covenant or would riot now be liable for any damages which may have actually resulted from their breach thereof, regardless of whether or not such breach came about through their willful neglect. On the contrary, we would be constrained to hold that, having covenanted to keep the roof and walls in proper condition, respondents would be liable for any ascertained damages shown to have been the proximate result of their failure to perform the covenant.\\\\nThe trial court seems to have conceded, and we likewise assume from the very nature of the circumstances narrated above, that appellant was damaged to some extent by respondents\\\\u2019 failure to keep the roof in proper condition against leakage. However, the important question in this case, both in the superior court and in this court, was and is not merely whether the appellant has sustained some damage by respondents\\\\u2019 breach of their covenant, but, rather, whether the appellant has established the amount of his alleged damages by the required degree of proof.\\\\nAppellant\\\\u2019s complaint was drawn upon the theory that the measure of his damages was his loss of profits. At the trial, he endeavored at first to establish recovery strictly upon that theory alone, but later changed his position somewhat, to include as an additional measure of recovery the difference between the rental value of the property in the condition required by the covenant of the lease and the value thereof in the condition in which the property actually was at and prior to the time the action was brought. The trial court held that the evidence was insufficient to establish any definite amount of loss with any reasonable degree of accuracy, under either theory of the measure of damages. This appeal presents the question of whether the trial court was correct in its holding.\\\\nWhile there is a diversity of judicial opinion on the question of the measure of damages recoverable by the lessee from the lessor for the latter\\\\u2019s breach of covenant to repair, the decisions are in general accord upon the postulate that the damages recoverable for the breach of such covenant must be such as are the direct, natural, and proximate result of the breach, and such as may reasonably be supposed to have been within the contemplation of the parties at the time they made the contract; and, conversely, that remote, contingent, or speculative damages are not recoverable. 32 Am. Jur. 592, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a7 717; 36 C. J. 165, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a7 801.\\\\nThe most usual rule or measure for assessing a tenant\\\\u2019s damages for breach of his landlord\\\\u2019s covenant to repair or other covenant with respect to the use of property, where there is no claim for, or proof of, special damages, is the difference between the rental value of the property if kept in the condition of repair or utility required by the covenant and the rental value in the condition in which the property actually is. Ingalls v. Beall, 68 Wash. 247, 122 Pac. 1063; Purcell v. Warburton, 70 Wash. 129, 126 Pac. 89; Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co., 102 Wash. 423, 173 Pac. 47; Schermerhorn v. Sayles, 123 Wash. 139, 212 Pac. 156; Yakima Lodge No. 53, K. P. v. Schneider, 173 Wash. 639, 24 P.

R. 1239.\\\\nOn the other hand, where special damages, such as loss of profits, are specifically set forth and proved, the recovery by a tenant, for breach of his landlord\\\\u2019s covenant to repair or other covenant with respect to the use of property, is not restricted to the difference in rental value, as expressed in the foregoing general rule, but may also include such loss of profits as has been directly and necessarily caused by the landlord\\\\u2019s wrongful act or default. In such case, however, the loss must be shown with a reasonable degree of certainty and accuracy, and the proof establishing the loss must be clear and convincing, free from speculation or conjecture. These complementary statements express a rule to which this court is definitely committed. Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co., supra; Schermerhorn v. Sayles, supra; accord: Kohne v. White, 12 Wash. 199, 40 Pac. 794; Cordes v. Guy Inv. Co., 146 Wash. 143, 262 Pac. 131. Other cases illustrating the same principle are: DeHoney v. Gjarde, 134 Wash. 647, 236 Pac. 290; Schultz v. Wells Butchers\\' Supply Co., 151 Wash. 382, 275 Pac. 737; Blakiston v. Osgood Panel & Veneer Co., 173 Wash. 435, 23 P. (2d) 397; Quist v. Zerr, 12 Wn. (2d) 21, 120 P. (2d) 539; Automatic Canteen Co. of Washington v. Automatic Canteen Co. of America, 182 Wash. 133, 45 P. (2d) 41. See, also, 15 Am. Jur. 558, Damages, \\\\u00a7 150.\\\\nThe position taken by this court on this general subject is well illustrated by the case of Matzger v. Arcade Building & Realty Co., supra, which was an action for damages against a landlord for interference with the access of light and ventilation to a storeroom occupied by a tenant. On the question of loss of profits as a measure of damages, the court said:\\\\n\\\\u201cIt may be granted that, in certain cases, a tenant may show a loss of profits in the conduct of an established business where the landlord has unreasonably interfered with the full enjoyment and use of the demised premises. But cases so holding rest in an exception to a general rule, which has twice been declared by this court. Kohne v. White, 12 Wash. 199, 40 Pac. 794; Purcell v. Warburton, 70 Wash. 129, 126 Pac. 89. Interference with light is a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Taylor, Landlord and Tenant, 309(a).\\\\n\\\\u201cThe measure of damages for an interruption of quiet enjoyment by the landlord is the difference between the value of the use of the property as furnished by the landlord and the rent reserved. In other words, it is the diminished value of the use of the property. Tiffany, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a7 79g; Underhill, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a7 432; Taylor, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 177 and 317; 16 R. C. L. 770.\\\\n\\\\u201cLoss of profits are usually regarded as too contingent, remote or speculative to be considered. 16 R. C. L. 1056. The general rule should not be departed from unless it is impossible to measure the losses by it, or the character of the business is such and the proof of the profits so clear that the court can say, as a matter of law, that loss of profits was within the contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was made. If this be so, it will declare lost profits to be the measure of damages. . . .\\\\n\\\\u201cBut if it be held that the loss of usable value is not a proper measure of damages, the exception to the rule allowing a loss of profits should not be allowed in this case, for, in sound reason and under all authority, a loss of profits is not allowed unless they can be measured with a fair degree of accuracy. The testimony must be clear and free from taint of speculation or conjecture. The rule rests in a principle applied in all cases for damages arising out of a sale of property or the use of property.\\\\n\\\\u201cTo sustain a verdict for prospective profits, the jury must have some reasonable basis for estimating the worth of the business. From the nature of things, prospective profits cannot be proved to the dollar. Yet the law does demand that there shall be tangible evidence sufficiently clear and convincing to reasonably sustain a verdict. There must be some standard of comparison.\\\\u201d\\\\nAgain, in DeHoney v. Gjarde, supra, this court said:\\\\n\\\\u201cTrue, this court is committed to the rule that loss of profits may be recovered, but we have said that the loss must be shown with a reasonable degree of accuracy, and that the testimony establishing the loss must be clear and free from taint of speculation or conjecture. [Citing cases.]\\\\u201d\\\\nThe trial court applied these rules to the evidence in the instant case and came to the very emphatic conclusion that appellant had not shown any loss of profits with any reasonable degree of accuracy, but that, on the contrary, his testimony on that subject was at best speculative and conjectural. Our examination of the record leads us just as positively to the same conclusion.\\\\nThere was no showing of the amount of profits that appellant had customarily been making, nor was there any convincing evidence concerning the amount of loss of profits due to the condition of the premises. Appellant testified that the bookkeeper\\\\u2019s receipts showed a loss of ten or eleven dollars a day, but no books were produced in court, nor was any explanation given as to how the loss was computed. Appellant testified that some of his patrons quit coming to his place because of the leaky roof, and others because of the dilapidated appearance of the exterior of the place, but there was nothing definite shown as to how many people quit coming, or when they quit, or how much loss of profits was due to that circumstance. It is further to be noted that appellant claimed that his damages amounted to ten dollars a day, as though the roof was constantly leaking every day and every night. Manifestly, that is not true. It is also to be remembered that dances were held only two nights a week, and it was only on those nights that his patrons could have been discommoded by dripping water while dancing. With respect to loss of profits caused by respondents\\\\u2019 delay in painting the building, the proof is even more meager in extent and less certain as to the amount of loss sustained.\\\\nWe recognize that it would be impossible for appellant to establish his loss of profits with mathematical exactness or absolute certainty, and that consequently the law will not hold him to so strict a requirement, but in any event the burden was upon him to prove his loss with at least such certainty and accuracy as would enable the court to find from the evidence that he had been damaged in a stated amount. A reading of the record convinces us that neither the trial court nor anyone else could say that appellant had sustained a loss of profits in any specific amount whatever.\\\\nThe other measure of damages on which appellant relied for recovery was the alleged diminished rental value of the property. He testified that, because of respondents\\\\u2019 failure to repair and repaint the- building, the rental value of the premises was only fifty dollars a month instead of one hundred dollars, the amount he was required to pay, and did pay, during the period of the extension. Appellant\\\\u2019s qualification to testify on that subject is not shown by the record. Assuming for the sake of argument only, that his status as a tenant qualified him to testify thereon, we are not greatly impressed by his testimony in that respect. The arbitrators themselves had recently fixed the rental value at one hundred dollars a month, although that amount was in the nature of a compromise between the claims of the two parties. Moreover, Mr. Zerwoodis, the owner of the building, testified at the trial that the rental value of the property was one hundred fifty dollars a month, and that he could get that amount for it. His testimony upon that question seems to us to have the greater weight. We conclude, as did the trial court, that the appellant likewise failed to establish, by the required degree of proof, his damages upon the basis of the difference in rental value of the property.\\\\nFinally, appellant contends that, in any event, the trial court erred in refusing to award him nominal damages. That contention is without merit upon the appeal for it is the settled rule in this state that where the sole object of the action is the recovery of damages, the failure to give nominal damages is not ground for reversal of a judgment.

Massart et al., Respondents.\"],\"opinions\":[{\"text\":\"Hill, J.\\\\nThis is an appeal from a summary judgment dismissing an action for damages.\\\\nThe factual situation presented to the trial court on the motion for summary judgment, based on the pleadings, a deposition and affidavits, was as follows:\\\\nThe plaintiff, Gertrude Jorgensen, went to lunch with her married daughter. When they returned to the Jorgen-sen apartment, they found water on the floor of the kitchen and it was just beginning to spread to the living room. They moved some furniture, rolled back a rug, and \\\\u201cdammed\\\\u201d the water with towels and bath mats, thus preventing the encroachment of the water into the living room. The rug and furnishings belonged to the plaintiffs. The damming operation was not completely effective, as some \\\\u201cdid trickle out and went down the hall and to the guest closet.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe water came from a water line fitting broken by the representatives of the defendant plumbing company while installing a hot water tank in an apartment adjacent to that of the Jorgensens, and the water escaped until such time as it could be shut off at the meter.\\\\nMrs. Jorgensen and her daughter did nothing further until the water was shut off, but did report the fact that there was water in the apartment to the wife of the manager of the apartment.\\\\nIt is conceded that no one asked Mrs. Jorgensen to clear the water from the kitchen floor and that 30 to 40 minutes elapsed from the time that she discovered the water before she undertook, entirely on her own volition, the work of mopping it up.\\\\nShe prepared herself for that work by changing her clothes, putting on a pair of jeans and a sweat shirt, and canvas deck shoes with rubber soles. The method used in getting the water off the kitchen floor was to sop it with towels, wring the towels out in a large container, and then empty the contents of the container into the sink. This continued from some time \\\\u201cafter 2:00, probably 2:15, 2:30,\\\\u201d until about 4:00 o\\\\u2019clock. Her hands and feet were in the cold water during all of that time.\\\\nThere is no showing that Mrs. Jorgensen asked the plumbing company or the owner of the apartment to do anything about clearing the water out of her apartment; nor is there any showing that either of them offered to do anything about the situation, except that Mrs. Jorgensen in her deposition testified:\\\\n\\\\u201c . . . As I was about through a man from the plumbing shop came in and wanted to know if he could give us some help, and I said, \\\\u2018No, I\\\\u2019ve got it licked now.\\\\u2019 \\\\u201d\\\\nShe contracted laryngitis and was hospitalized, allegedly as a result of her contact with the cold water. The action was against the plumbing company, which was doing the work, and the owners of the apartment for damages sustained in consequence of Mrs. Jorgensen\\\\u2019s exposure to the cold water.\\\\nIt is the position of the defendants here, that if it is assumed that there is a jury question, as to the negligence of the defendants, that this is a classic example of volenti non fit injuria and that, in any event, Mrs. Jorgensen was contributorily negligent as a matter of law.\\\\nWe explained that maxim in Walsh v. West Coast Coal Mines (1948), 31 Wn. (2d) 396, 407, 411, 197 P. (2d) 233, 239, quoting from Gover v. Central Vermont R. Co. (1922), 96 Yt. 208, 118 Atl. 874:\\\\n\\\\u201c \\\\u2018If one knowing and comprehending the danger voluntarily exposes himself to it, though not negligent in so doing, he is deemed to have assumed the risk and is precluded from a recovery for an injury resulting therefrom. The maxim is predicated upon the theory of knowledge and appreciation of the danger and voluntary assent thereto.\\\\u2019 \\\\u201d\\\\nAnd, by way of further explanation, we quoted from White v. McVicker (1933), 216 Iowa 90, 246 N. W. 385:\\\\n\\\\u201c \\\\u2018The sum total of the application of this doctrine simply stated is that, where one is placed in the position where he has his choice of doing or not doing a given act, this doctrine applies.\\\\u2019 \\\\u201d\\\\nWe have here neither life, limb, nor property being endangered. We have no hasty or impulsive action. At least 30 minutes and perhaps \\\\u201cclose to an hour,\\\\u201d elapsed between the discovery of the water on the kitchen floor and the decision to \\\\u201csop\\\\u201d it up. There was a change of clothes in preparation for that work.\\\\nThis states the case as strongly as it can be stated for the defendants here. However, there remains the question as to what reasonable election or alternative was left to the plaintiff.\\\\nThe issues raised by this appeal included the three questions asked in Kingwell v. Hart (1954), 45 Wn. (2d) 401, 405, 406, 275 P. (2d) 431, 434, 435. The first two, i.e.,\\\\n\\\\u201c . . . Did plaintiff (1) know of and appreciate the danger or risk involved, and also (2) did he voluntarily consent to expose himself to it voluntarily\\\\u2019 including the meaning that defendant\\\\u2019s conduct has left plaintiff a reasonable election or alternative. See Emerick v. Mayr, 39 Wn. (2d) 23, 25, 234 P. (2d) 1079 (1951)), . . .\\\\u2019\\\\u2019(Italics ours)\\\\nmust be answered in the affirmative to establish the defense of volenti non fit injuria. And the third question,\\\\n\\\\u201c . . . (3) was the exposure unreasonable, that is, was it such that a reasonable person in plaintiff\\\\u2019s position would not expose himself to it, or, after accepting a reasonable risk, did plaintiff exercise proper care for his own protection against that risk.\\\\u201d\\\\nmust be answered in the affirmative to establish contributory negligence.\\\\nIt is apparent that Mrs. Jorgensen, after stopping the flow of water into the living room and confining it to the kitchen, did not impetuously, hastily, or inadvisedly enter into the project of removing the water. She waited for the running water to be cut off, then arrayed herself for the task. The remaining question is: did she have a reasonable election or alternative. If she didn\\\\u2019t sop or mop up this water, which had flooded her kitchen, who was going to do it. She was confronted with the further question of how long her dam of towels and bath mats would be effective.\\\\nIt may well be that, if tried, there would be testimony that as soon as they had remedied the more emergent condition in the apartment, where the water connection had broken, the defendants would have taken care of the situation in the Jorgensen apartment, had she waited. The offer of assistance from the plumbing company employee, to which we have referred, might be some indication that such would have been the case. But that is all conjecture; there is no suggestion of it in the record; and if that was so, how was Mrs. Jorgensen to know it. Enough has been said to indicate that, in our opinion, there was a question of fact: Did Mrs. Jorgensen have a reasonable alternative? This a jury would have to pass upon before the defendants could establish their defense of volenti non fit injuria.\\\\nThe test, on the issue of contributory negligence, was whether a reasonable person in the plaintiff\\\\u2019s position would have exposed himself to the risks inherent in mopping and sopping up the water on the kitchen floor; and, if after accepting a reasonable risk, the plaintiff exercised proper care for his own protection against that risk.\\\\nThe Restatement says:\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is not contributory negligence for a plaintiff to expose himself to danger in a reasonable effort to save a third person or the land or chattels of himself or a third person from harm.\\\\u201d Restatement, Torts \\\\u00a7 472 (1934); and, in the next section:\\\\n\\\\u201cIf the defendant\\\\u2019s negligence has made the plaintiff\\\\u2019s exercise of a right or privilege impossible unless he knowingly exposes himself to a risk of bodily harm, the plaintiff is not guilty of contributory negligence in so doing unless the risk is unreasonable.\\\\u201d Restatement, Torts \\\\u00a7 473 (1934).\\\\nMrs. Jorgensen\\\\u2019s right to the use of her kitchen is apparent. We are satisfied that whether a reasonably prudent and cautious individual, in like circumstances, would have proceeded to get the water off the kitchen floor, is a jury question; and we so hold.\\\\nThe defendants also urge, in support of the summary judgment of dismissal, that the laryngitis of the plaintiff was an injury which could not have been foreseen or reasonably anticipated as the probable result of any negligence for which they may be responsible. They cite, and rely on, Ottevaere v. Spokane (1916), 89 Wash. 681, 155 Pac. 146.\\\\nWe have approached foreseeability with telescopic lenses since Ottevaere and 1916. See Orcutt v. Spokane Cy. (1961), 58 Wn. (2d) 846, 364 P. (2d) 1102; McLeod v. Grant Cy. School Dist. (1953), 42 Wn. (2d) 316, 322, 255 P. (2d) 360; Berglund v. Spokane Cy. (1940), 4 Wn. (2d) 309, 319, 103 P. (2d) 355; Frazee v. Western Dairy Products (1935), 182 Wash. 578, 47 P. (2d) 1037.\\\\nIn the Berglund and McLeod cases we quoted Harper (1938), Torts \\\\u00a7 7, p. 15:\\\\n\\\\\"... The manner in which the risk culminates in harm may be unusual, improbable and highly unexpectable, from the point of view of the actor at the time of his conduct. And yet, if the harm suffered falls within the general danger area, there may be liability, provided other requisites of legal causation are present.\\\\u201d\\\\nAs early as 1917 we were distinguishing the Ottevaere case in Hellan v. Supply Laundry Co. (1917), 94 Wash. 683, 689, 163 Pac. 9, saying:\\\\n\\\\u201c . . . This court, in common with some others, has said that \\\\u2018any injury which could not have been foreseen or reasonably anticipated as the probable result of an act of negligence is not actionable,\\\\u2019 in that the act is too remote to be a proximate cause. Ottevaere v. Spokane, 89 Wash. 681, 155 Pac. 146. But that language must not be taken in an absolute sense. It does not mean that the probability of injury must be so obvious as to be necessarily anticipated by the wrongdoer, nor does it mean that he must have reasonably anticipated that injury would probably result to the exact person or in the exact form or way in which it did result. ...\\\\u201d\\\\nWe certainly can not, on the record before us, say that the laryngitis of the plaintiff could not have been foreseen or reasonably anticipated as a result of the flooding of the plaintiff\\\\u2019s kitchen, which for the purposes of this opinion we have assumed to be the result of the negligence of the defendants.\\\\nThe defendants had the burden, as the party moving for a summary judgment, to show that there were no genuine issues of fact.

J.\\\\nOne morning, Carrie Thomas, then age 18 months \\\\u2014 now the minor plaintiff in this lawsuit \\\\u2014 was playing in the low-rent, 1-bedroom apartment which her parents leased from the defendant public housing authority. Her mother was not feeling well and was taking a nap in the bedroom. Carrie\\\\u2019s 17-year-old uncle, Floyd Grubs, was engaged in washing and rinsing dishes in a mixture of hot and cold water. Suddenly Carrie screamed. Her young uncle rushed into the bathroom. He found the child standing beside a small pool of water which had overflowed from the washbasin. Her nightgown was soaking wet on the left side. Water so hot it approached boiling temperature filled the basin. The hot-water faucet handle was too hot to touch. Apparently Carrie had climbed up, turned on the faucet, and fallen into the washbasin after it had filled with water. The entire left side of her body was severely scalded. Second and third degree burns and permanent injuries resulted.\\\\nCarrie Thomas and her parents had moved into their low-rent apartment unit some 4 months before the accident. It was one of 582 living units in the project known as West Park, operated by the defendant public housing authority. The Thomases\\\\u2019 written lease with defendant contained, inter alia, the following provisions:\\\\nLiability \\\\u2014 The Management shall not be responsible for loss or damage to property, nor injury to persons, occuring [sic] in or about the demised premises, by reason of any existing or future condition, defect, matter or thing in said demised premises or the property of which the premises are a part, nor for the acts, omissions or negligence of other persons or Tenants in and about the said property. The Tenant agrees to indemnify and save the Management, its representatives and employees harmless from all claims and liability for damage to property or injuries to persons occuring [sic] in or about the demised premises\\\\nTenant\\\\u2019s Responsibilities\\\\nb. Entry \\\\u2014 The Management may enter the premises during all reasonable time for inspection or repairs, or to remove signs, alterations or additions placed on the premises without permission.\\\\nc. Damage \\\\u2014 The tenant shall notify the Management immediately of necessary repairs or of damage to buildings or fixtures.\\\\nThe heating appliance which furnished hot water for the Thomases\\\\u2019 apartment was about 22 years old at the time of the accident. A small plate or cover on the side of the water heater bore a legend reading \\\\u201cremove plate for adjustment.\\\\u201d Underneath the cover was a set screw which in effect operated as a lever to adjust the thermostat and the temperature of the water from extreme \\\\u201chot\\\\u201d to extreme \\\\u201ccold\\\\u201d or some intermediate point. At the time plaintiff suffered her injuries, the mechanism was set all the way to the \\\\u201chot\\\\u201d position. Even if the mechanism had been set at a lower or colder temperature reading, nevertheless, the water temperature actually produced could have been extremely hot. This is because the set screw could be unscrewed, moved, and reset to vary and to make the entire temperature range either higher or lower. Testimony introduced at the trial was capable of supporting a jury finding that no one checked the position of the set screw or the temperature range of the water before Carrie and her parents moved into the apartment, nor while they resided there. Three times during the period in which the Thomases resided in the apartment, defendant\\\\u2019s maintenance man serviced the water heater at the Thomases\\\\u2019 request. The servicing consisted of cleaning out soot, adjusting the air on the burner, and, on one occasion, relighting the pilot light; but it did not entail checking or changing the thermostat adjustment.\\\\nThe water heater in question was tested after the accident. On the hottest setting, it produced water ranging from 180 to 208 degrees fahrenheit. On six arbitrarily chosen lower settings, it produced lower ranges of temperature down to 122 to 126 degrees on the lowest setting, with the one exception that it once produced water of 200 degrees on the middle setting after the burner was left on overnight. Expert testimony produced at the trial tended to show that, based on the distortion of a plastic toothbrush which had been in the washbasin, the water which scalded Carrie was approximately 200 degrees fahrenheit, or hotter.\\\\nThis lawsuit was instituted by her guardian ad litem alleging that her injuries were proximately caused by the negligence of the defendant-appellant public housing authority. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff upon which judgment was entered, and the defendant appeals contending it is entitled to a judgment of dismissal as a matter of law. Defendant-appellant\\\\u2019s three assignments of error raise three questions which we will now discuss:\\\\nFirst, the defendant housing authority maintains that it was under no duty to prevent the injuries posed in plaintiff\\\\u2019s complaint; i.e., it is not chargeable with negligence because the occurrence of the accident was not reasonably foreseeable. Anderson v. Reeder, 42 Wn.2d 45, 253 P.2d 423 (1953), and Fritsche v. Seattle, 10 Wn.2d 357, 116 P.2d 562 (1941), stand for the unquestioned proposition that when an accident occurs which is not reasonably foreseeable and which, according to common experience, is not likely to happen, a defendant is not chargeable with negligence. However, for a defendant to be held liable for maintaining a dangerous condition, proof as to foreseeability of the particular manner or nature of the occurrence is not necessary. It is sufficient if the general type of danger is reasonably foreseeable. Fleming v. Seattle, 45 Wn.2d 477, 275 P.2d 904 (1954).\\\\nThe defendant\\\\u2019s maintenance superintendent admitted on the witness stand that water even as hot as 180 degrees fahrenheit was dangerously hot. The fact that he considered it dangerous clearly implies that he could foresee that people could be exposed to it long enough to cause injury. This seems particularly pertinent in view of the well known fact that many small children were living in the low-rent public housing project.\\\\nAs indicated hereinbefore, there was substantial evid\\\\u00e9nce produced at the trial to support a jury determination that the water which scalded Carrie was 200 degrees fahrenheit, or hotter. There was also evidence that the defendant\\\\u2019s maintenance employees knew that the hot water from this type of hot water tank could and did reach 200 degrees, and hotter, when the thermostat was out of adjustment or the lever was on the highest setting. It should reasonably have been known to the defendant\\\\u2019s agents that exposure to water of that heat even momentarily could cause serious injuries. Tending to support a conclusion that the injuries suffered by the plaintiff were a foreseeable consequence of the overly hot water is our decision in Kidwell v. School Dist. No. 300, 53 Wn.2d 672, 335 P. 2d 805 (1959). Therein, this court held that an injury to a child which occurred in the moving of a precariously balanced, high upright piano in a school activities room was sufficiently foreseeable to sustain liability.\\\\nWe find further support for concluding that the injuries were reasonably foreseeable in a case involving a somewhat analogous factual pattern. In Thompson v. Paseo Manor South, Inc., 331 S.W.2d 1 (Mo. App. 1959), a 22-month-old child fell from her bed and came into contact with uninsulated and unprotected heating pipes which caused injuries for which suit was brought against the landlord. In reversing a judgment for the defendant landlord, the court, 331 S.W.2d at 6-7, made the following observation in regard to foreseeability:\\\\nIt may be conceded that this child falling from its bed and becoming entangled in the pipes and receiving the injuries complained of was an unusual occurrence. But the landlord knew that the child occupied the apartment, and no doubt knew of children occupying other similar apartments. It is not the unusual manner of receiving injuries that determines liability, but whether the defendant could have reasonably anticipated that a child would receive injuries from the pipes. In Hammontree v. Edison Bros. Stores, Inc., Mo. App., 270 S.W.2d 117, 126, it is said: \\\\u201cRelating to those dangers to be reasonably anticipated \\\\u2014 if there is some probability or likelihood, not a mere possibility, of harm sufficiently serious that ordinary men would take precautions to avoid it, then the failure to do so is negligence. While the likelihood of a future happening is the test of a duty to anticipate, this does not mean the chances in favor of the happening must exceed those against it. The test is not the balance of probabilities, but of the existence of some probability of sufficient moment to induce the reasonable mind to take the precautions which would avoid it.\\\\u201d (Italics ours.)\\\\nWe think that the evidentiary pattern of the instant case meets the test or standard for establishing liability, i.e., the overly hot water posed a danger to tenants and children of tenants of the housing project which was sufficiently foreseeable to support a determination of liability. See also Housinq Authority of Birmingham v. Morris, 244 Ala. 557, 14 So. 2d 527 (1943).\\\\nNext, the defendant maintains that assuming the water was excessively hot, it is not liable under applicable landlord-tenant law. The defendant cites such cases as Flannery v. Nelson, 59 Wn.2d 120, 366 P.2d 329 (1961), and Mesher v. Osborne, 75 Wash. 439, 134 Pac. 1092 (1913), for the proposition that a landlord is not liable for an obvious or patent defect, and is only liable for an obscure or latent defect, if he has actual knowledge of it. Conceding this to be a fair statement of the law of Washington and of some other states, nevertheless in many other jurisdictions, actual knowledge of the landlord is not required as the basis of liability if he has knowledge of facts which would lead a reasonable man to suspect the defect actually exists.\\\\nAssuming our landlord and tenant law to be as indicated above, we are convinced the evidence in this case shows an obscure or latent defect or dangerous condition existed. Dr. Botimer testified that, in his opinion, if the water had been 140 degrees fahrenheit instead of 200 degrees, Carrie would not have suffered severe second and third degree burns on the entire left side of her body nor lost three fingers as she did, i.e., her injuries, if any, would have been very minor. From the testimony of various witnesses, the jury could have found that there is no way for the average person to tell the difference between water of 140 degrees fahrenheit and water heated to 200 degrees fahrenheit without using a high range thermometer, which the average person does not have and would not think of using. The verdict indicates a jury determination that the hot water heater or its condition at the time constituted an obscure or latent dangerous condition. A sufficient basis was laid relating to the issue involved, and the question was properly submitted to the jury for its determination. Howard v. Washington Water Power Co., 75 Wash. 255, 134 Pac. 927 (1913).\\\\nThere is some dispute about the extent or the character of the knowledge of the defect necessary to render the defendant liable under existing law. The plaintiff points out that the type of water heater involved was installed throughout the housing project, and emphasizes evidence showing that the maintenance men of the defendant knew that this type of water heater could produce dangerously hot water. It is further emphasized that tenants sometimes unwittingly altered the temperature range of the heaters and that the projects\\\\u2019 hot water faucets thus on occasion produced not only water too hot for safe domestic use but even live steam. Plaintiff then cites Carusi v. Schulmerick, 98 F.2d 605 (D.C. Cir. 1938), wherein the landlord\\\\u2019s agents knew of a latent defect in a particular type of window installed throughout an apartment building. The court seems to have held such knowledge was sufficient to render the landlord liable when, because of its dangerous condition, one such window fell and injured the plaintiff.\\\\nContrariwise, the defendant cites Daulton v. Williams, 81 Cal. App. 2d 70, 183 P.2d 325 (1947). We do not find that case to be apposite. The court in Daulton specifically stated that the defect involved was a patent one.\\\\nIn any event, we do not find it necessary to decide whether the defendant possessed the requisite knowledge solely on the basis of its knowledge as to the dangerous condition inherent in this type of water heater.\\\\nThere was testimony that Floyd Grubs, while living in the Thomases\\\\u2019 apartment, had complained to defendant\\\\u2019s maintenance man that the water in the apartment was too hot. This was a month or two before the accident and at a time when the maintenance man was cleaning the water heater in question. Neither Grubs nor the Thomases had reason to know how hot too hot was, but the defendant\\\\u2019s maintenance personnel had good reason to know that too hot could be dangerously hot. There was sufficient evidence presented for the jury to conclude that the defendant had actual knowledge of the defect or dangerous conditions. See Howard v. Washington Power Co., supra.\\\\nBeing aware of the danger, the defendant at the very least could have taken the following simple and economically feasible precautions: (1) check the temperature of the water produced by each water heater in the course of the regular between-tenants inspection of the apartments, and (2) advise all tenants, particularly new ones on their entry, to be careful regarding the hot water in the apartments and especially not to change the screw setting on the thermostat since this could cause the water to be heated to a dangerously hot temperature. Defendant took none of these steps in regard to the Thomases or the water heater in their apartment. Having failed to discharge its responsibility, the defendant must bear the consequences.\\\\nThe defendant\\\\u2019s third argument is that the provision of the lease, quoted above, which relates to liability is effective to release it from liability for Carrie\\\\u2019s injuries. In support of the validity of this exculpatory clause, the defendant cites this court\\\\u2019s decisions in Magerstaedt v. Eric Co., 64 Wn.2d 298, 391 P.2d 533 (1964); Griffiths v. Henry Broder ick, Inc., 27 Wn.2d 901, 182 P.2d 18, 175 A.L.R. 1 (1947); and Broderson v. Rainier Nat\\\\u2019l Park Co., 187 Wash. 399, 60 P.2d 234 (1936). In the Griffiths case, the court held that an agreement by which a private apartment house owner held the manager harmless from liability for injuries resulting from any cause, including its own negligence, was not contrary to public policy. Because of the difference in the character and relationship of the parties to the agreement in Griffiths, that case is not determinative of the issue here presented.\\\\nNeither is the Broderson case apposite, since there the issue concerned the validity of a release of liability clause whereby the defendant, which rented winter sports equipment, protected itself against liability to those patrons who voluntarily chose to participate in dangerous winter sports. We note, however, that the opinion in Broderson, 187 Wash, at 404, contains the following language:\\\\nConsidering the question whether the waiver was void as against public policy, it is a well-recognized rule that corporations engaged in the performance of public duties, as for instance, common carriers, and, generally, those engaged in the operation of public utilities, cannot by contract relieve themselves of liability for negligence in the performance of their duty to the public or the measure of care they owe their patrons under the law. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Chicago M. & S.P.R. Co., 175 U.S. 91, 20 S. Ct. 33; Railroad Co. v. Lockwood, 84 U.S. 357.\\\\nIn the Magerstaedt decision, there is language which supports the validity of a lease provision relieving the corporate lessor from liability to the lessee of a restaurant for certain causes, although the exculpatory clause was not the basis of the decision in that case. The landlord-tenant relationship in that case, however, was quite different than in the instant matter.\\\\nThe Laws of 1939, ch. 23, now codified as RCW 35.82, created the defendant public housing authority and enabled it to build and operate the West Park project in which the Thomases lived. It is noteworthy that RCW 35.82.010 reads in part as follows:\\\\nFinding and declaration of necessity. It is \\'hereby declared: (1) that there exist in the state insanitary or unsafe dwelling accommodations and that persons of low income are forced to reside in such insanitary or unsafe accommodations; that within the state there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations available at rents which persons of low income can afford and that such persons are forced to occupy overcrowded and congested dwelling accommodations; . . . (2) that these areas in the state cannot be cleared, nor can the shortage of safe and sanitary dwellings for persons of low income be relieved, through the operation of private enterprise, and that the construction of housing projects for persons of low income (as herein defined) would therefore not be competitive with private enterprise; (3) that the clearance, replanning and reconstruction of the areas in which insanitary or unsafe housing conditions exist and the providing of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low income are public uses and purposes for which public money may be spent and private property acquired and are governmental functions of state concern; ....\\\\nThe definition of \\\\u201chousing project,\\\\u201d as found in RCW 35.82.020, contains the following language:\\\\n(9) \\\\u201cHousing project\\\\u201d shall mean any work or undertaking: . . . (b) to provide decent, safe and sanitary urban or rural dwellings, apartments or other living accommodations for persons of low income; ....\\\\nFrom this expression of the legislature, the conclusion is inescapable that two of the primary objectives in creating public housing authorities such as the defendant are: (1) to provide safe and sanitary housing, and (2) to make such housing available to persons of low income who otherwise would be forced to reside in unsanitary and unsafe housing.\\\\nPublic housing such as that provided by the defendant is only available to \\\\u201cpersons of low income,\\\\u201d in other words, those who the legislature has determined are unable to obtain safe and sanitary housing elsewhere. The situation presents a classic example of unequal bargaining power. Dean Prosser analyzes the problem and the applicable law as follows:\\\\nIt is quite possible for the parties expressly to agree that the defendant is under no obligation of care for the benefit of the plaintiff, and shall not be liable for the consequences of conduct which would otherwise be negligence. There is no public policy which prevents the parties from contracting as they see fit. Thus one who accepts a gratuitous pass on a railway train, or enters into a lease or some other relation, may agree that there shall be no responsibility for negligence.\\\\nThe courts have refused to uphold such agreements, however, where one party is at such obvious disadvantage in bargaining power that the effect of the contract is to put him at the mercy of the other\\\\u2019s negligence. Prosser, Torts \\\\u00a7 55, at 305-06 (2d ed. 1955). (Italics ours.)\\\\nWe think that the instant matter, in which the Thomases had to sign the defendant\\\\u2019s standard lease form in order to acquire housing at West Park, is an example of an obvious disadvantage in bargaining power which would have the effect, if the exculpatory provision were upheld, of putting the tenants at the mercy of the defendant housing authority\\\\u2019s negligence. This would be contrary to the public policy inherent in the basic legislation and authorization relative to low rent public housing.\\\\nIn support of its position on the validity of the exculpatory provision in the lease, the defendant also cites Manius v. Housing Authority of Pittsburgh, 350 Pa. 512, 39 A.2d 614 (1944). The Manius case did uphold a release clause in a lease between a tenant and a public housing authority against a challenge that it was void as against public policy. The Pennsylvania court did not give much consideration to the argument, however, and dismissed it rather summarily in a brief paragraph.\\\\nIn Housing Authority of Birmingham v. Morris, 244 Ala. 557, 14 So.2d 527 (1943), the Supreme Court of Alabama held that a disclaimer of liability by a housing authority is not effective to insulate it from liability to its tenants for its own negligence. Curiously enough, the Morris case also involved a plaintiff who was scalded by hot water, the injury being caused by the defendant\\\\u2019s negligent maintenance of a hot water heater. On rehearing, the court unanimously adhered to its prior opinion and concluded that the housing authority could not be allowed to \\\\u201ccreate and maintain a trap to inflict personal injury upon its tenants.\\\\u201d 14 So.2d at 535. The careful and exhaustive analysis of the Alabama court was based in part on consideration of the statutes which authorized and created the housing authority. These statutes, which the court quoted at length and which are very similar to those of this state found in RCW 35.82, emphasized that the purpose of the housing projects was to provide safe and sanitary housing for persons of low income. We believe the Morris decision is better and more carefully reasoned than that in Manius.\\\\nWe conclude that it is against the public policy of this state, as expressed by the legislature, to allow a public housing authority, created to provide safe and sanitary housing for persons of low income, to exempt itself by prearrangement or contract from liability to its tenants for its own negligence.\\\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\\\nDonworth, Rosellini, and Hamilton, JJ., and Barnett, J.

It is unmeandered, which means that in the original federal government survey the surveyors did not locate the shoreline, but merely ran the government section lines across the lake. As a result many shoreline property owners also own subdivided portions of the lake bed. The lake is surrounded principally by single residences, together with a few multiple residences, a public school ground, and a small city park. Residents of the area have long used the entire lake surface for recreational activities.\\\\nThe plaintiffs are 24 property owners who own upland abutting the lake and, in some instances, parts of the lake bed, or who otherwise have access rights to the lake by reason of an easement to the lake shore. Defendants own a parcel of land abutting on the east side of the lake at the south end, about two-thirds of which is upland and one-third lake bed. Title is traced to an 1872 federal government patent, which made no reference to the lake.\\\\nThe south end of the lake, including defendants\\\\u2019 property, has been business zoned for many years, and was formerly operated as Playland Amusement Park. The property is currently zoned commercial general (CG) by the city of Seattle. In zoning the land around the lake the city ran its zoning lines across the lake surface so that the entire lake bed is zoned. Defendants\\\\u2019 submerged land is zoned commercial general, while other portions of the lake bed are zoned residential.\\\\nIn August, 1966 defendants purchased the property in question, after having procured preliminary architectural plans for the construction of four apartment buildings. Apartment buildings Nos. 1 and 2 were to be constructed partly on the upland, but would extend approximately 130 feet out into the lake, supported on two finger-like piers secured by cement pilings. Apartments Nos. 3 and 4 were to be constructed entirely on the upland abutting the lake. Mortgage commitments were obtained based on these plans, and on June 12, 1967, a building permit was issued by the city of Seattle.\\\\nOn June 5, 1967, excavation of the upland was commenced and on June 8 or 9 dirt was first pushed into the lake about 25 feet in order to form a base or pad. Some of the plaintiffs immediately protested to defendants and began making an investigation to determine the extent of defendants\\\\u2019 construction plans. The protests went unheeded so plaintiffs on July 5, 1967, brought an action to enjoin defendants from filling or building over the surface of the lake. In conjunction with that action they posted a $1,000 bond and obtained an exparte temporary order restraining the defendants from interfering with the surface area and shoreline of Bitter Lake.\\\\nThe motion for a temporary injunction was heard on July 15, 1967, by a different department of the superior court than that which later heard the case on the merits. The court denied the motion but delayed the effective date of the order so that plaintiffs might petition this court for a writ of review. On July 20, 1967, that petition was denied by this court on procedural grounds. It was understood at the time that the ruling did not reach the merits of the petition.\\\\nOn July 21, 1967, the temporary restraining order was dissolved. Plaintiffs then made every effort to get the case to trial and in fact secured a substantially earlier trial date than would have been possible through the normal progression of the trial docket in King County. Trial was commenced on October. 10, 1967.\\\\nPending the trial on the merits, defendants proceeded as rapidly as possible with the construction of apartment No. 1 and the concrete slab to support it. The slab projects out into the lake approximately 130 feet and is 77 feet wide. Beneath it the lake is filled with dirt, and pilings of steel beams are used to support it. The slab will be 1.18 feet above high water and 6.18 feet above low water. The apartment constructed on the slab will be three stories in height. At the time of trial it was planned that both apartments Nos. 1 and 2 would extend out over the water. However, in oral argument in this court defendants stated that the plans for apartment No. 2 had been modified so that it would be constructed entirely on upland.\\\\nThe trial court determined that defendants had no right to build out into Bitter Lake, and enjoined them from further construction over the surface of the lake. In addition, defendants were ordered to remove the existing structure and earth fill, which had been put there during the period prior to the trial.\\\\nDefendants\\\\u2019 12 assignments of error are directed to (1) the trial court\\\\u2019s determination that defendants had no right to build out into Bitter Lake, (2) the remedy granted in view of hardship caused to defendants relative to hardship plaintiffs would suffer if the mandatory injunction were denied, (3) prejudice of the trial judge in view of his personal experience as attorney in a prior case which dealt with surface rights of lake shore owners, (4) the trial court\\\\u2019s findings that defendants disregarded protests of plaintiffs and the pendency of this suit, and its failure to include a specific finding on defendants\\\\u2019 good faith, and (5) the trial court\\\\u2019s failure to find adverse possession of the area in question by defendants\\\\u2019 predecessor in title.\\\\nIn the challenge to the trial court\\\\u2019s determination that defendants had no right to build out into Bitter Lake, defendants emphasize the effect of the commercial zoning imposed on their property. Defendants contend that their apartment is a riparian use, and that reasonableness is the test for its permissibility. They further contend that reasonableness in this case is a legislative determination expressed in the city zoning ordinance. In other words, the Seattle City Council, by conferring a commercial general zoning classification on this property, and issuing a building permit, determined that an apartment is a reasonable and proper use of this tract, which includes lake bed property.\\\\nRiparian rights and privileges are conferred upon a property owner by virtue of the contiguity of his property to a body of water. Mayer v. Grueber, 29 Wis. 2d 168, 138 N.W.2d 197 (1965). Although we have never promulgated an all-inclusive definition of riparian rights, we have previously recognized as riparian rights on nonnavigable lakes the rights of swimming, fishing, boating, and bathing. Snively v. Jaber, 48 Wn.2d 815, 296 P.2d 1015, 57 A.L.R.2d 560 (1956). Further, these rights have been characterized as vested property interests, included in the protection afforded by Const, art. 1 \\\\u00a7 16, which provides that private property shall not be taken or damaged for public or private use without just compensation. In re Clinton Water Dist., 36 Wn.2d 284, 218 P.2d 309 (1950).\\\\nWe cannot agree that defendants\\\\u2019 apartment constructed over water constitutes a riparian use, or that its permissibility comes within a rule of reasonableness as determined by the Seattle zoning authorities.\\\\nMere proximity of the apartment to the water does not render it a riparian use. With respect to a structure, such a use must be so intimately associated with the water that apart from the water its utility would be seriously impaired. This is not the case with defendants\\\\u2019 prospective use. The utility of the apartment is in no way dependent upon the waters of Bitter Lake, and its utility as an apartment would be in no way impaired apart from this lake. This is evidenced by the fact that apartments Nos. 2, 3 and 4 are entirely on upland property.\\\\nNor may defendants justify the presence of their apartment by the commercial zoning classification imposed by the city of Seattle or by the issuance of a building permit.\\\\nAll riparian owners along the shore of a natural, nonnavigable lake share in common the right to use the entire surface of the lake for boating, swimming, fishing, and other similar riparian rights so long as there is no unreasonable interference with the exercise of these rights by other respective owners. Snively v. Jaber, supra; Botton v. State, 69 Wn.2d 751, 420 P.2d 352 (1966) , These rights are vested property rights, and may not be taken or damaged for public or private use without just compensation. In re Clinton Water Dist., supra. It follows, therefore, that while the city of Seattle might regulate the exercise of these rights by means of its police power, it may not totally divest plaintiffs of them through the mechanisms of zoning. Indeed, the effect of this case, if we were to follow defendants\\\\u2019 reasoning, would be to divest plaintiffs of valuable property rights for the private use and benefit of defendants. Such a result is clearly contrary to the law, and we are certain was not intended by the Seattle zoning authorities when the commercial general classification was placed on defendants\\\\u2019 property.\\\\nDefendants next assert error in the trial court\\\\u2019s choice of remedy, in that defendants were required to remove the structure it placed out over the surface of the lake. It must be noted, in response to this assertion, that since we have determined that defendants\\\\u2019 apartment does not constitute a riparian use, it becomes in effect an encroachment upon plaintiffs\\\\u2019 common rights to use this portion of the lake surface for purposes of riparian enjoyment. In view of this, it is defendants\\\\u2019 contention that nonetheless, an application of the doctrine of relative hardship, or balancing the equities, requires that they not be enjoined to remove the existing structure now in place. Although it is not clear from the evidence, the amount of loss might be substantial that defendants could suffer if unable to complete apartment No. 1. Estimates by the plaintiffs based on defendants\\\\u2019 figures fix the maximum possible loss at approximately $100,000. Defendants on the other hand contend they will lose in excess of $250,000. The evidence indicates, however, that when it became apparent that defendants faced a lawsuit to halt construction of apartment No. 1 with the ever existing possibility that they might lose, they took no action to mitigate their potential loss by attempting to renegotiate or cancel the construction contracts or other financial commitments. At that time only a small proportion of the total financial commitment had actually been expended and the remaining potential loss depended on the binding effect of the commitments, most of which were oral in nature, the rigidity of the other contracting parties position, and the feasibility of altering construction plans.\\\\nFrom the very commencement of defendants\\\\u2019 construction they were aware of the protests of other riparian owners. The encroaching structure did not exist at the time of suit, but was built during the pendency of this suit. Defendant contractor, Mr. Ray Lotto, testified that after the temporary restraining order was dissolved \\\\u201cwe proceeded as fast as we could, because, at that time, we already lost two weeks.\\\\u201d\\\\nThus, defendants proceeded to construct the apartment in question with full knowledge that their right to do so was contested and that there was a real likelihood, in view of our holding in Snively v. Jaber, supra, that the case on the merits would be decided against them. In addition, the court in its oral opinion dissolving the temporary restraining order, pointed out that the case was going to be appealed, would be a landmark case, and the Supreme Court might look at it differently. During oral arguments defendants\\\\u2019 counsel admitted that they knowingly took a risk by continuing construction while the case was pending on the merits, and indeed, there is no other possible interpretation of defendants\\\\u2019 conduct. Their explanation was that although not much construction had been done on apartment No. 1 they were already financially committed to the entire project and felt they had to take the risk.\\\\nThe benefit of the doctrine of balancing the equities, or relative hardship, is reserved for the innocent defendant who proceeds without knowledge or warning that his structure encroaches upon another\\\\u2019s property or property rights. City of Dunsmuir v. Silva, 154 Cal. App. 2d 825, 317 P.2d 653 (1957); Winthers v. Bertrand, 239 Ore. 97, 396 P.2d 570 (1964). Under the circumstances of this case, defendants are not entitled to evoke the benefit of this doctrine.\\\\nDefendants next assert that the bias of the trial judge prevented them from having a fair trial. This assignment is based on the prior experience of the trial judge as counsel for Dr. J. Howard Snively, who was subsequently a party in Snively v. Jaber, supra. Although the trial judge did not represent Dr. Snively in that suit, he did offer legal advice to him. Defendants argue that that experience prejudiced the judge\\\\u2019s views on the issue of defendants\\\\u2019 good faith and caused him to prejudge the case even before the trial started.\\\\nRCW 4.12.040 provides in part:\\\\nNo judge of a superior court of the state of Washington shall sit to hear or try any action or proceeding when it shall be established as hereinafter provided that said judge is prejudiced against any party or attorney, or the interest of any party or attorney appearing in such cause.\\\\nClearly, defendants show no prejudice which comes within the requirements of this statute. Merely because a judge has had occasion to study a point of law and offer advice based on his interpretation of it is no grounds for disqualification. This assignment is without merit. \\'\\\\nDefendants charge error in the trial court\\\\u2019s refusal to find that defendants\\\\u2019 predecessor in interest, Playland Amusement Park, established the exclusive right to use the disputed portion of the lake by adverse possession. We find no merit to this contention in light of testimony of a former park policeman that his intentions were only to prevent persons from entering the park without paying the entrance fee. There was no evidence that other riparian owners were ever prevented from using the entire surface of the lake, or that the operators of Playland Amusement Park ever intended to assert any proprietary rights over portions of the surface abutting its shore. Indeed, certain residents of Bitter Lake testified that they had always used the entire surface of the lake, including portions over the area owned by defendants, even while Playland was in operation. In any event, it was a disputed question of fact and as there was substantial evidence to support the finding of the trial court, it will not be disturbed on appeal. State ex rel. Carroll v. Seattle Hotel Bldg. Corp., 41 Wn.2d 595, 250 P.2d 982 (1952).\\\\nDefendants next assign error to the trial court\\\\u2019s refusal to grant a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. The evidence was the testimony of a daughter of defendants\\\\u2019 predecessor in interest and related to the question of adverse use of that portion of the lake in dispute. The substance of her testimony was before the trial judge by way of affidavit in support of the motion. It was to some extent cumulative in nature, and we do not feel that the court abused its discretion in denying the motion.\\\\nDefendants finally argue that under Hughes v. Washington, 389 U.S. 290, 19 L. Ed. 530, 88 Sup. Ct. 438 (1967), the federal common law controls the result here; and that under the federal common law the defendants have a right to build their apartment on a fill on their portion of the lake bed.\\\\nThis contention is based on the fact that defendants\\\\u2019 title is to upland property and submerged land, and is traced to an 1872 federal government patent. This patent was issued prior to Washington statehood, and made no reference to the lake.\\\\nIn Hughes, supra, the issue presented was whether federal or state laws governs the ownership of accreted land, gradually deposited by the ocean on adjoining upland property conveyed by the United States to petitioner\\\\u2019s predecessor in title prior to Washington statehood. The United States Supreme Court held that federal law applied, and that under federal law petitioner was entitled to the accretion that had gradually formed along her ocean-front property.\\\\nThe Hughes decision is in no way applicable to the instant case. We are not concerned here with the ownership of land or the extent or validity of title created by a federal act. As stated by Mr. Justice Stewart, concurring in Hughes, 389 U.S. at 295:\\\\nSurely it must be conceded as a general proposition that the law of real property is, under our Constitution, left to the individual States to develop and administer. And surely Washington or any other State is free to make changes, either legislative or judicial, in its general rules of real property law, including the rules governing the property rights of riparian owners. Nor are riparian owners who derive their title from the United States somehow immune from the changing impact of these general state rules. Joy v. St. Louis, 201 U. S. 332, 342. For if they were, then the property law of a State like Washington, carved entirely out of federal territory, would be forever frozen into the mold it occupied on the date of the State\\\\u2019s admission to the Union.\\\\nWe must, therefore, conclude that there was no error in the trial court\\\\u2019s determination of the property rights of the riparian owners on Bitter Lake, nor in the remedy afforded in the form of a mandatory injunction.\\\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\\\nFinley, C. J., Weaver, Hunter, and McGovern, JJ., concur.\\\\nJanuary 24,1969.

Foisy, is seeking the possession of his real property, unpaid rent and damages. The defendant (appellant), Richard Kent Wyman, appeals from a judgment in favor of the plaintiff.\\\\nIn his complaint, the plaintiff alleged in effect; (1) That on December 31, 1970, the defendant took possession of a house which the plaintiff is seeking to recover, pursuant to a 6-month lease requiring $300 to be paid for said term, plus water and other utility charges; (2) that during the term of the lease the defendant paid the sum of $95, leaving $205 still owing for the 6-month period; (3) that the defendant remained upon the premises after the expiration of the lease; (4) that the rental payment after the expiration of the lease was to be $75 per month; (5) that after the defendant refused to pay the accrued rent, the plaintiff served a 3-day notice to pay rent or vacate upon the defendant on August 27, 1971; (6) that the defendant failed to pay any of the amounts owing after the 3-day notice was served upon him.\\\\nThe defendant\\\\u2019s answer raised several affirmative defenses including breach of implied warranty of habitability.\\\\nDuring trial the defendant testified that he took possession of the house on March 3, 1971. It appears that the parties executed the lease in question on March 8, 1971, although the lease was dated December 31, 1970, and was to cover a term of 6 months, which was to commence on January 1,1971, and end on June 30,1971.\\\\nThe lease in question also contained an option to purchase. The testimony of the defendant indicates that he thought he was purchasing the house rather than renting it. His testimony also indicates that the house contained a number of defects when he entered into the lease and it indicates that he was aware of some of the defects when he agreed to rent the house, but not all of them.\\\\nThe trial court concluded that the defendant was guilty of unlawful detainer of the premises rented to him by the plaintiff. However, it refused to enforce the provisions of what it termed the \\\\u201cpurported lease.\\\\u201d It found that the reasonable rental for the period of occupancy of the premises was the sum of $50 per month commencing with March 3, 1971, until such time as the defendant removed himself. In effect, the court held the lease was invalid. The court also held that a writ of restitution should issue to the sheriff to require the surrender of possession if the defendant did not voluntarily withdraw and that damages for the period March 3, 1971, through April 3, 1972, were to be doubled if the defendant did not surrender the premises by April 3, 1972. The defendant appeals, although the plaintiff does not cross-appeal from the court\\\\u2019s findings.\\\\nThe primary contention raised by the defendant is that the trial court erred in refusing to accept evidence as to his affirmative defense of breach of implied warranty of habitability. The defendant argues that the plaintiff\\\\u2019s failure to maintain the premises in a habitable condition constitutes a failure of consideration upon the part of the plaintiff and relieves the defendant of his obligation to pay rent. We agree that the tenant should have been permitted to introduce evidence at trial in support of this theory of defense.\\\\nThe premises in question, according to the testimony of the defendant, contained a number of defects including a lack of heat, no hot water tank, broken windows, a broken door, water running through the bedroom, an improperly seated and leaking toilet, a leaking sink in the bathroom, broken water pipes in the yard and termites in the basement. No objection was made to the introduction of this testimony. The testimony of the defendant also indicates that he painted the interior and made repairs upon the premises, but ceased making repairs when he learned of a municipal court action being initiated against the plaintiff as a result of numerous housing code violations within the house. In addition, the record reveals that the landlord was informed of the defects and was prosecuted successfully for violations of the Seattle housing code.\\\\nDuring the trial the defendant attempted to introduce the testimony of two housing inspectors as to the housing code violations which existed on the premises. The trial court sustained the plaintiff\\\\u2019s objections to this testimony upon the theory that the condition of the premises was not relevant to the issue before the court. We disagree with the reasoning of the trial court in refusing to accept the evidence as to the condition of the premises, although it should be stated that this issue has not been heretofore specifically addressed in this jurisdiction in relation to our unlawful detainer statutes.\\\\nThroughout the United States, the old rule of caveat emptof in the leasing of premises has been undergoing judicial scrutiny.\\\\nIn Pines v. Perssion, 14 Wis. 2d 590, 596, 111 N.W.2d 409 (1961), the court stated:\\\\nTo follow the old rule of no implied warranty of habitability in leases would, in our opinion, be inconsistent with the current legislative policy concerning housing standards. The need and social desirability of adequate housing for people in this era of rapid population increases is too important to be rebuffed by that obnoxious legal clich\\\\u00e9, caveat emptor. Permitting landlords to rent \\\\u201ctumble-down\\\\u201d houses is at least a contributing cause of such problems as urban blight, juvenile delinquency, and high property taxes for conscientious landowners.\\\\nSee Reste Realty Corp. v. Cooper, 53 N.J. 444, 251 A.2d 268 (1969); Marini v. Ireland, 56 N.J. 130, 265 A.2d 526 (1970); Lemle v. Breeden, 51 Hawaii 426, 462 P.2d 470 (1969); Javins v. First Nat\\\\u2019l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925, 27 L. Ed. 2d 185, 91 S. Ct. 186 (1970), and Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill. 2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).\\\\nIn Lemle v. Breeden, supra, the court reviewed the rule of caveat emptor and the current trend toward finding an implied warranty of habitability in leases, and stated on page 433:\\\\nThe application of an implied warranty of habitability in leases gives recognition to the changes in leasing transactions today. It affirms the fact that a lease is, in essence, a sale as well as a transfer of an estate in land and is, more importantly, a contractual relationship. From that contractual relationship an implied warranty of habitability and fitness for the purposes intended is a just and necessary implication. It is a doctrine which has its counterparts in the law of sales and torts and one which when candidly countenanced is impelled by the nature of the transaction and contemporary housing realities. Legal fictions and artificial exceptions to wooden rules of property law aside, we hold that in the lease of a dwelling house, such as in this case, there is an implied warranty of habitability and fitness for the use intended.\\\\n(Footnote omitted.)\\\\nIn Javins v. First Nat\\\\u2019l Realty Corp., supra, the court analyzed the various exceptions to the common-law rule that the lessor has no duty to repair and stated on page 1078:\\\\nThese as well as other similar cases demonstrate that some courts began some time ago to question the common law\\\\u2019s assumptions that the land was the most important feature of a leasehold and that the tenant could feasibly make any necessary repairs himself. Where those assumptions no longer reflect contemporary housing patterns, the courts have created exceptions to the general rule that landlords have no duty to keep their premises in repair.\\\\nIt is overdue for courts to admit that these assumptions are no longer true with regard to all urban housing. Today\\\\u2019s urban tenants, the vast majority of whom live in multiple dwelling houses, are interested, not in the land, but solely in \\\\u201ca house suitable for occupation.\\\\u201d Furthermore, today\\\\u2019s city dweller usually has a single, specialized skill unrelated to maintenance work; he is unable to make repairs like the \\\\u201cjack-of-all-trades\\\\u201d farmer who was the common law\\\\u2019s model of the lessee. Further, unlike his agrarian predecessor who often remained on one piece of land for his entire life, urban tenants today are more mobile than ever before. A tenant\\\\u2019s tenure in a specific apartment will often not be sufficient to justify efforts at repairs. In addition, the increasing complexity of today\\\\u2019s dwellings renders them much more difficult to repair than the structures of earlier times. In a multiple dwelling repair may require access to equipment and areas in the control of the landlord. Low and middle income tenants, even if they were interested in making repairs, would be unable to obtain any financing for major repairs since they have no long-term interest in the property.\\\\n(Footnotes omitted.)\\\\nWe find the reasoning of these cases extremely persuasive. Any realistic analysis of the lessor-lessee or landlord-tenant situation leads to the conclusion that the tenant\\\\u2019s promise to pay rent is in exchange for the landlord\\\\u2019s promise to provide a livable dwelling. As Judge Skelly Wright stated in the Javins case on page 1074:\\\\nWhen American city dwellers, both rich and poor, seek \\\\u201cshelter\\\\u201d today, they seek a well known package of goods and services \\\\u2014 a package which includes not merely walls and ceilings, but also adequate heat, light and ventilation, serviceable plumbing facilities, secure windows and doors, proper sanitation, and proper maintenance.\\\\n(Footnote omitted.) Javins v. First Nat\\'l Realty Corp., 428 F.2d 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925, 27 L. Ed. 2d 185, 91 S. Ct. 186 (1970). The value of the lease today then, whether it is oral or written, is that it gives the tenant a place to live, and he expects not just space but a dwelling that protects him from the elements of the environment without subjecting him to health hazards.\\\\nIn House v. Thornton, 76 Wn.2d 428, 457 P.2d 199 (1969), we rejected the doctrine of caveat emptor as it applied to the sale of a new residence and found an implied warranty that the structure is fit for the buyer\\\\u2019s intended purpose. In doing so, we noted that the old rule of caveat emptor has little relevance to the sale of a brand-new house by a vendor-builder to a first buyer for the purposes of occupancy. By analogy, the old rule of caveat emptor has little relevance to the renting of premises in our society. There can be little justification for following a rule that was developed for an agrarian society and has failed to keep pace with modern day realities. We therefore hold that in all contracts for the renting of premises, oral or written, there is an implied warranty of habitability and breach of this warranty constitutes a defense in an unlawful detainer action. See Javins v. First Nat\\\\u2019l Realty Corp., supra; Lund v. MacArthur, 51 Hawaii 473, 462 P.2d 482 (1969); Marini v. Ireland, 56 N.J. 130, 265 A.2d 526 (1970); Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill. 2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).\\\\nIt can be argued, however, that the defendant should not be entitled to the protection of an implied warranty of habitability since he knew of a substantial number of defects when he rented the premises and the rent was reduced from $87 per month to $50 per month. We believe this type of bargaining by the landlord with the tenant is contrary to public policy and the purpose of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability. A disadvantaged tenant should not be placed in a position of agreeing to live in an uninhabitable premises. Housing conditions, such as the record indicates exist in the instant case, are a health hazard, not only to the individual tenant, but to the community which is exposed to said individual. As the court recognized in Pines v. Perssion, supra, such housing conditions are at least a contributing cause of such problems as urban blight, juvenile delinquency and high property taxes for the conscientious landowners.\\\\nOur belief that public policy demands such a result is reinforced by our review of Laws of 1973, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 207, which became effective July 16, 1973. The legislature in passing this bill and the Governor in signing it have recognized that public policy demands this result. Laws of 1973, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 207, provides in part:\\\\nSec. 6. The landlord will at all times during the tenancy keep the premises fit for human habitation, and shall in particular:\\\\n(1) Maintain the premises to substantially comply with any applicable code, statute, ordinance, or regulation governing their maintenance or operation, which the legislative body enacting the applicable code, statute, ordinance or regulation could enforce as to the premises rented;\\\\n(2) Maintain the roofs, floors, walls, chimneys, fireplaces, foundations, and all other structural components in reasonably good repair so as to be usable and capable of resisting any and all normal forces and loads to which they may be subjected;\\\\n(5) Except where the condition is attributable to normal wear and tear, make repairs and arrangements necessary to put and keep the premises in as good condition as it by law or rental agreement should have been, at the commencement of the tenancy;\\\\n(7) Maintain all electrical, plumbing, heating, and other facilities and appliances supplied by him in reasonably good working order;\\\\n(8) Maintain the dwelling unit in reasonably weather-tight condition;\\\\n(10) Except where the building is not equipped for the purpose, provide facilities adequate to supply heat and water and hot water as reasonably required by the tenant;\\\\nSec. 8. The tenant shall be current in the payment of rent before exercising any of th\\\\u00e9 remedies accorded him under the provisions of this chapter: Provided, That this section shall not be construed as limiting the tenant\\\\u2019s civil remedies for negligent or intentional damages: Provided Further, That this section shall not be construed as limiting the tenant\\\\u2019s right in an unlawful detainer proceeding to raise the defense that there is no rent due and owing.\\\\nSec. 10.\\\\n(6) Nothing in this section shall prevent the tenant from agreeing with the landlord to undertake the repairs himself in return for cash payment or a reasonable reduction in rent, the agreement thereof to be agreed upon between the parties, and such agreement does not alter the landlord\\\\u2019s obligations under this chapter.\\\\nIt may also be argued that the defendant should not be afforded the protection of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability since the defendant signed a lease which contained an option to purchase. However, as heretofore stated, the trial court failed to recognize the validity of the lease. There is no cross-appeal from this determination and we are therefore bound by the trial court\\\\u2019s decision.\\\\nThe plaintiff argues that the trial court was correct in disregarding the Seattle housing code as it was improperly pleaded and no properly authenticated copy of the housing code was offered. These issues were not before the court when it rejected the testimony of the housing inspectors. It was not until after the court had rejected the testimony of the housing inspectors on the basis of their testimony being irrelevant that the housing code was offered into evidence. Had the court rejected the housing code on the grounds suggested by the plaintiff, the defendant would have been in a position to move to amend his pleadings. The argument as to the housing code not being properly authenticated, we believe, is without merit in view of RCW 5.44.080 which states:\\\\nWhen the ordinances of any city or town are printed by authority of such municipal corporation, the printed copies thereof shall be received as prima facie evidence that such ordinances as printed and published were duly passed.\\\\nThe copy of the housing code that was offered into evidence by the defendant is printed by authority of the City of Seattle and is therefore prima facie evidence that the ordinances as printed and published were duly passed.\\\\nThe testimony relating to the housing code violations should have been admitted into evidence, and the trial court erred in ruling that the condition of the premises was not relevant to the issue of rent due and owing. While the housing code violations in and of themselves do not establish a prima facie case that the premises are uninhabitable, they are evidence which aids in establishing that the premises are uninhabitable.\\\\nThe plaintiff argues, in effect, however, that the unlawful detainer statutes are not designed for defenses such as breach of implied warranty of habitability due to the nature of the action. In light of our previous discussion, we believe this to be without merit.\\\\nOne of the basic issues in an unlawful detainer action of this nature is whether or not there is any rent due. RCW 59.12.170, which governs the entry of judgment and execution in an unlawful detainer action, states that upon a finding of default in the payment of rent, \\\\u201cthe judgment shall also declare the forfeiture of the lease, agreement or tenancy.\\\\u201d RCW 59.12.030 provides:\\\\nA tenant of real property for a term less than life is guilty of unlawful detainer either:\\\\n(3) When he continues in possession in person or by subtenant after a default in the payment of rent, and after notice in writing requiring in the alternative the payment of the rent or the surrender of the detained premises . . .\\\\nSince the affirmative defense of breach of implied warranty of habitability goes directly to the issue of rent due and owing, which is one of the basic issues in an unlawful detainer action as the above statutes indicate, we now hold said defense is available in an unlawful detainer action of this nature. See Jack Spring, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill. 2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972).\\\\nThe defendant also contends that the trial court erred in rendering judgment in the instant case, since the amount demanded in the 3-day notice was more than the trial court found was actually due and owing. We disagree.\\\\nIn Provident Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Thrower, 155 Wash. 613, 617, 285 P. 654 (1930), we stated:\\\\nAs to the form and contents of the notice or demand, a substantial compliance with the statute is sufficient.\\\\nSee Sowers v. Lewis, 49 Wn.2d 891, 307 P.2d 1064 (1957). See also Erz v. Reese, 157 Wash. 32, 288 P. 255 (1930) (wherein we stated on page 35 that \\\\u201cwe have never adopted the strictest rule of construction as to the form or contents of such notices under our unlawful detainer statutes, chiefly for the reason, doubtless, that the statutes prescribe no form.\\\\u201d). In the Provident Mutual case the notice was defective in three respects: (1) It contained the signature of the agent rather than the owner; (2) it overstated the amount of rent due by $165 as found by the trial court; and (3) it defectively described the premises. Although we did not specifically address the issue of the overstatement of the amount of rent due, we did hold the notice substantially complied with the requirements of Rem. Comp. Stat. \\\\u00a7 812 (now RCW 59.12.030).\\\\nIn the instant case, the 3-day notice to pay rent or vacate the premises that was served upon the defendant called for the payment of $205, the balance due under the lease, plus $75 per month for July and August. There was no dispute as to the monthly rental payment under the terms of the purported lease; however, there was a conflict as to the amount of the monthly rental due for the months of July and August. The plaintiff testified the rent for those months was to be $75 per month, and the defendant testified that it was to be $50 per month. It appears that the plaintiff\\\\u2019s demand for rental in the notice was in conformity with his good faith determination as to the amount of rental due, and that the defendant was not prejudiced as he could have tendered to the plaintiff the amount of rental due according to his understanding, of the agreement. See C. J. Peck, Landlord and Tenant Notices, 31 Wash. L. Rev. 51, 61 (1956). In tendering the amount due to the plaintiff, of course, he would deduct that amount due which he believed he was relieved from paying due to the landlord\\\\u2019s breach of his implied warranty of habitability.\\\\nWe believe that under the above facts, the plaintiff\\\\u2019s demand for rental was in substantial compliance with the statute and the fact that there was a dispute as to the amount of rent due, which was later determined contrary to the plaintiff, should not invalidate the unlawful detainer proceeding.\\\\nThe defendant also contends that the portion of RCW 59.12.170, which authorizes the doubling of damages, is unconstitutional as it is in violation of the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution.\\\\nWe need not reach this issue in light of the passage of the \\\\u201cResidential Landlord-Tenant Act of 1973\\\\u201d (Laws of 1973, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 207), which eliminated the mandatory double damage provision from the law.\\\\nWhere substantial legislative or decisional changes in the applicable statutory provisions have been made, thereby precluding the imposition of the challenged provision, the constitutional issue need not be resolved.

Bellingham, 80 Wn.2d 547, 558, 496 P.2d 512 (1972):\\\\nIt is a general rule that, where only moot questions or abstract propositions are involved, or where the substantial questions involved in the trial court no longer exist, the appeal, or writ of error, should be dismissed. There is an exception to the above stated proposition. The Supreme Court may, in its discretion, retain and decide an appeal which has otherwise become moot when it can be said that matters of continuing and substantial public interest are involved. . . . This exception to the general rule obtains only where the real merits of the controversy are unsettled and a continuing question of great public importance exists.\\\\n(Citations omitted.)\\\\nGiven the passage of the new landlord-tenant act and the absence of any actual trial court imposition of double damages in the instant case, the exception to the above rule is not in force and we therefore need not comment further upon this issue.\\\\nFor the guidance of the trial court at the new trial to which the defendant is entitled, the finder of fact must make two findings where the defendant claims the landlord has breached his implied warranty of habitability: (1) Whether the evidence indicates that the premises were totally or partially uninhabitable during the period of habitation and, if so, (2) what portion, if any or all, of the defendant\\\\u2019s obligation to pay rent is relieved by the landlord\\\\u2019s total or partial breach of his implied warranty of habitability. If the finder of fact determines that the entire rental obligation is extinguished by the landlord\\\\u2019s total breach, then the action for unlawful detainer based on nonpayment of rent must fail. If, on the other hand, the court determines that the premises are partially habitable, and the tenant failed to tender to the plaintiff a sufficient amount to pay rent due for the partially habitable premises, then judgment shall be entered in accordance with RCW 59.1^2.170.\\\\nThe judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial consistent with this opinion.\\\\nHale, C.J., and Rosellini, Hamilton, Stafford, and Utter, JJ., concur.\\\\nEvidence of one or two minor infractions of a housing code which do not affect habitability are inconsequential and would not entitle the tenant to a reduction in rent.

That creation might well be a desirable change in Washington law, but this simply is not the case in which it should be implemented.\\\\nThe majority\\\\u2019s application of such a warranty to the defects presented in this case and even its characterization of the defendant as a mere \\\\u201ctenant\\\\u201d are unsound in light of the defendant\\\\u2019s testimony, elicited by his own counsel:\\\\nQ. And what was the agreement between you and the Foiseys [sic] relating to the purchase of that house? A. The agreement was that I was to pay $50 a month to buy the house . . . Q. So, it was your understanding that the agreement was that you were to buy the house for $50 a month? A. That was my understanding . . . Q. At the time you moved in] were there defects on the premises? A. All kinds but I tried my best to bring them up to some remedy of standard . . . Q. What was your understanding as to what you had to do to exercise the option? A. My understanding was to clean the house up and fix it up to some degree. Q. So, in other words, you thought that\\\\u2014 A. Take care of it like a regular home owner. I figure it was mine and I was going to try to do the best I could but I run into all kinds of difficulty with the permit . . . Q. So, it was your understanding that you were purchasing the house and that is your only obligation to pay $50 a month? A. That was the whole understanding at the conception of the deal because her mother told me [objection], Q. So, the only time prior to March you were on the premises was to just look at it? A. Right. I told them I would buy and they said fine. They put me in it for $50 a month. Q. Had you done any work cleaning up the house or anything around the premises before you moved in on [sic] March? A. Oh, yes, I had to. Q. Before you moved in? A. Right, I had to. In the basement there was termites and there was things. Q. When were you doing those things? A. In February . . . Q. At that time did you have any agreement with the Foiseys [sic] as to whether or not you were going to purchase it? A. I had the agreement before I walked in that house. That\\\\u2019s when they told me you can have it for $50 a month. They wanted $87 a month. I said it isn\\\\u2019t worth it because it\\\\u2019s sitting still and the windows are out. \\'[Interruption.] Q. That understanding was that you were going to pay $50 per month? A. Correct. That is the only way I would walk in that house because I wasn\\\\u2019t in the proper position to bargain. They bargained to me because I saw a deal and I grabbed it . . . Q. As far as you were concerned, you never received any word that you were anything but a purchaser, is that right? A. To my knowledge, that was the only way I would have gone into that house as a purchaser. What would I want to rent it for I had a house of my own.\\\\nFrom that testimony it is perfectly clear that the defendant waS fully aware of the defects and deficiencies in the premises. Those defects and deficiencies were the very reason he was willing and able to negotiate lower payments.\\\\nIt requires no authority to sustain the proposition that a person who takes possession of premises with known defects, intends to repair those defects, bargains for reduced monthly payments and characterizes the transaction as a \\\\u201cdeal\\\\u201d which he \\\\u201cgrabbed,\\\\u201d neither deserves nor needs the protection of an implied warranty of habitability.\\\\nThe fact of the matter, apparent from the record, is that the defendant encountered difficulties with his continued, anticipated repairs when the housing code violations pending against the plaintiffs came to light. That situation might give rise to other remedies, but they are not asserted here.\\\\nBut apart from the foregoing, and even if the defendant is to be characterized as a tenant in the strict legal sense of that word, the majority fails to recognize that the Seattle housing code was not properly before the trial court.\\\\nIn his answer, affirmative defense and counterclaim, the defendant alleged violations of the provisions of the housing, building, fire, health and sanitation codes of the City of Seattle. Such shotgun pleading is a clear violation of CR 9 (i). At the time of trial, absolutely no proof of the housing code was provided, except to offer an unauthenticated, unidentified booklet entitled \\\\u201cHousing Code, City of Seattle.\\\\u201d The trial court, on that ground alone, correctly rejected testimony about violations of a city ordinance which had not been properly pleaded, properly authenticated or properly identified.\\\\nThe trial court should be affirmed.\\\\nWright, J., concurs with Brachtenbach, J.\",\"type\":\"dissent\",\"author\":\"Brachtenbach, J.\"},{\"text\":\"Ryan, J.\\\\n(concurring in the result of the dissent)\\\\u2014 However desirable the majority\\\\u2019s endorsement of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability may be, this is not a proper case for its application.\\\\nI would, therefore, concur in the result of the dissent.\\\\nPetition for rehearing denied December 12, 1973.\\\\nJustice Ryan is serving as a justice pro tempore of the Supreme Court pursuant to Const. art. 4, \\\\u00a7 2(a) (amendment 38).\",\"type\":\"concurrence\",\"author\":\"Ryan, J.\"}],\"attorneys\":[\"John Gant, for appellant.\",\"Thomas J.

The action was brought more than 3 years after the builder-vendor sold the last condominium unit, and many of the units changed hands before suit was filed. The applicable statutes of limitation properly should have barred many of the plaintiffs\\' actions. We hold that the trial court incorrectly applied the discovery rule for determining when plaintiffs\\' causes of action accrued.\\\\nThe trial court greatly extended the implied warranty of habitability beyond the contours defined by this court. The trial court also recognized a new cause of action to this jurisdiction in negligent construction. This court cannot allow sympathy for the plaintiffs to lead to the creation of a logically inconsistent and vague theory of recovery that fails to provide useful precedent. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.\\\\nYarrowood is a condominium complex located in Belle-vue. One hundred forty-four of the 155 units have private decks. Because of the steep topography and siting, there are 32 entry walkways which traverse from the parking area to provide access to unit entrances. Twenty-three of these serve only one apartment each. The bulk of the areas at issue were these private decks and walkways.\\\\nThe Declaration of Condominium (as amended) provides that private decks off individual apartments are \\\\\"limited common areas\\\\\", to which the individual apartment owner has exclusive access. The individual homeowners are solely responsible for their maintenance. Certain access walkways are also limited common areas, although the Declaration of Condominium does not specify precisely which walkways. The trial court found all these areas were \\\\\"common areas,\\\\u201d \\\\\"regardless of the subclassification of the private decks as \\'limited common areas\\'\\\\\" (Finding of fact 15; Clerk\\'s Papers, at 15) as that term is used in the Declaration of Condominium and by statute. See RCW 64.32.010(6)(b), (ll).\\\\nThe original developer, Ferguson Development Company and related corporate entities started work on the project in 1973. Ferguson intended to develop the complex in phases, and hired architect El Baylis to design the entire complex. After experimenting with various railing designs for the private decks and walkways, Ferguson adopted a wooden frame closed rail system. This involved the construction of a wall approximately 40 inches high, made of two-by-four studs enclosed on both sides with siding and gypsum board. The wall is capped by a wooden rail and joined at the bottom to the horizontal surface of the deck.\\\\nIn May 1975, when Phase I (67 apartments) was partially constructed, Ferguson defaulted and Coldwell Banker took over. From that point, Coldwell Banker was the owner, developer, construction contractor and vendor of the apartment units at Yarrowood.\\\\nWhen Coldwell Banker took over the project it hired architect Baylis to inspect and assess the project. Baylis informed Coldwell Banker that the decks and balconies were not adequately flashed at wall and\\\\/or rail junctures. In at least one instance a deck had no way to drain and would probably rot. In September 1975, Baylis notified Coldwell Banker that standing water on the flat asphalt roof of the largest building in the complex would lead to problems unless corrected. In response and as leakage became apparent and complaints were made, Coldwell Banker took corrective steps to repair or replace each of the Phase I decks that were called to its attention. Nonetheless, the trial court found the repairs and other construction changes made were ineffective to eliminate all of the problems.\\\\nColdwell Banker completed Phase I by mid-1976. The City of Bellevue Building Department issued a certificate of occupancy on June 10, 1976, although purchasers had occupied a number of units from late December 1975.\\\\nIn March 1976, Coldwell Banker contracted with architect Baylis to prepare construction drawings for Phase II, which added an additional 88 apartment units. Coldwell Banker instructed Baylis to make design changes in the walkway and deck assemblies in an attempt to avoid the problems experienced in Phase I. Phase II construction began in 1976, and on September 15, 1977, Bellevue issued a final certificate of occupancy. The last unit was sold in February 1978, some 4 years and 9 months before the commencement of the lawsuit in November 1982.\\\\nColdwell Banker turned over management of Yarrowood to the Board of Directors of the Yarrowood Homeowners Association (the Board) after substantially all of the units were sold. Following a short period in which Coldwell Banker acted as property manager, the Board hired a resident manager to handle complaints from homeowners, and to perform minor maintenance and repairs. The first manager served from early 1978 to 1980. During 1978 and 1979, he received complaints relating to 10 to 15 of the decks at Yarrowood. Some of the decks had damage which was plainly visible from public areas such as the parking lot for one of the buildings.\\\\nBy June 1979, at least one deck had so deteriorated that the homeowner asked the Board about having it rebuilt. In connection with this and other complaints being received, the Board contacted an attorney for advice on who was responsible for repairing the deteriorating decks. The Board described the problem to the attorney as a design defect. After reviewing the Declaration of Condominium, the attorney responded that in his view the responsibility for repair and maintenance of these limited common areas lay with the individual homeowners, rather than with the Board.\\\\nThe Board relayed the attorney\\'s advice to the homeowners, and took the position that these defects were not the Board\\'s responsibility. Some of the Board members had initial leakage problems which Coldwell Banker had worked on. In fact, the majority of the nine members of the Board in the years 1979 and 1980 knew during or before their service on the Board of leakage problems on Yarrowood decks.\\\\nIn November 1980, the Board contacted a second attorney for his opinion on repair responsibilities. This attorney advised if the problem was a construction defect then the Board, rather than the individual homeowners, should pursue claims against the developer on behalf of the common ownership. Upon receiving this advice, the Board specifically asked the homeowners to lodge their complaints with the Board\\'s resident manager. A number of such complaints were formally registered before the next meeting, which took place on December 18, 1980.\\\\nIn November 1982, the members of the Board filed suit in their representative capacities on behalf of both original and subsequent purchasers of affected units against Cold-well Banker, El Baylis, and Ferguson. The suit alleged defendants were liable under theories of negligent construction, breach of express and implied warranties, misrepresentation, and violations of the Consumer Protection Act, RCW 19.86.\\\\nAs of that time, 74 out of the 155 units had changed hands from the original purchasers to subsequent purchasers. By May 1984, the month of trial, the number of units owned by subsequent purchasers had risen to 81, constituting a majority of the units in the complex.\\\\nThe trial court found plaintiffs\\' suit was timely brought within the applicable statute of limitations, reasoning that the claims accrued at the December 18, 1980 meeting, when the Board had notice that the deck and walkway problems were widespread throughout the project. The court found that\\\\nAlthough plaintiffs received some isolated complaints from unit owners of water leaks and stains with respect to the private decks attached to the unit, there was not a sufficient number of complaints or sufficient quality of the complaints received to indicate a project-wide problem with substantially all decks and the degree to which the decks were affected until December 1980.\\\\nFinding of fact 30; Clerk\\'s Papers, at 20-21.\\\\nThe court held there was no liability under the Washington Consumer Protection Act, nor under plaintiffs\\' theory of breach of express warranty or misrepresentation. Plaintiffs have not appealed those rulings.\\\\nThe court noted that the applicable provisions of the uniform building code and industry standards required that the decks, balconies, walkways, ramps, and stairway structures be constructed in a watertight manner. It found, however, that the areas were not so constructed, and allowed water to penetrate from the time of original construction. These defects, both latent and patent, the court held, led to rotting and the substantial impairment of the structures.\\\\nThe court found that rotting conditions between initial occupancy and 1980 were known by the homeowners, who complained to Coldwell Banker, which responded to all complaints by making repairs and replacements. It found, however, that the complaints were not in every case communicated to the Board.\\\\nA determination was made by the court that the defective conditions were caused by negligent construction practices which left\\\\nthe largest majority of the affected structures in Yarro-wood unfit for their ordinary and intended purpose and dangerous to use within a very short time after their construction. . . .\\\\nAlthough structurally safe for the buyer\\'s intended purpose at the time of construction and initial purchase by individual owners, a number of the private decks, balconies and walkways became unsafe through the action of dry rot from water trapped as a result of construction defects.\\\\nFindings of fact 19, 20; Clerk\\'s Papers, at 18. It held that both the original and subsequent purchasers could recover for the. entire damages to common areas and limited common areas under a negligence theory, and that the original owners could also recover under implied warranties of habitability.\\\\nColdwell Banker, as owner-developer-builder-vendor of the complex, which was constructed for sale to the general public, was determined to owe a duty of proper construction, a duty which includes the nonnegligent construction of elements within the common and limited common areas. The court further held that no privity of contract need exist in order for Coldwell Banker to be liable for damages caused by negligent performance of its contractual duty.\\\\nColdwell Banker was also held to have impliedly warranted to the original purchasers that the common and limited common areas were fit for their ordinary and intended purpose, that the applicable building code provisions were complied with and that the construction was performed in a proper and workmanlike manner with respect to building methods, techniques, or materials used. The court concluded that Coldwell Banker breached the implied warranty of habitability (thus defined), and was liable to plaintiffs for damages sustained as a proximate result of this breach.\\\\nOf the $378,758 in damages awarded by the trial court, $87,680 represented repair costs to private decks which were limited common areas exclusive to units owned by subsequent purchasers. No separate finding was made with respect to walkways for which damages were awarded, but which serve secondary purchasers\\' units.\\\\nThree issues are raised on appeal: (1) whether the trial court correctly determined the time the plaintiffs\\' causes of action accrued for purposes of the discovery rule; (2) whether the court properly applied the implied warranty of habitability theory as developed by our courts; and (3) whether the trial court erred in recognizing a new cause of action in negligent construction.\\\\nStatute of Limitations\\\\nColdwell Banker acknowledges the Board\\'s standing to sue on behalf of two or more individual condominium owners with similar claims pursuant to RCW 64.32.240. That statute provides, in part:\\\\nWithout limiting the rights of any apartment owner, actions may be brought as provided by law and by the rules of court by the manager or board of directors, in either case in the discretion of the board of directors, on behalf of two or more of the apartment owners, as their respective interests may appear, with respect to any cause of action relating to the common areas and facilities or more than one apartment. . . .\\\\n(Italics ours.) The Board has standing to sue on behalf of and as a surrogate for the individual homeowners. Coldwell Banker argues with merit that this statutory grant of standing does not accord the Board or the Association the status of a separate juristic entity. The Association is not incorporated. It has no life independent of the individual homeowners who are by statute and under the terms of the Declaration of Condominium required to be members of the Association. The rights being asserted, and the claims being made, belong to the individual homeowners. As found by the trial court, the lawsuit was brought in the names of the nine then members of the Board of Directors of the Association in their representative capacities, not in the name of the Board or Association as a separate entity.\\\\nThe trial court, however, determined that the claims asserted here accrued at the time the Board had notice that the deck and walkway problems were widespread throughout the project. Neither RCW 64.32.240 nor the discovery rule support such a conclusion. RCW 64.32-.240 authorizes the Board to bring suit on behalf of two or more apartment owners. There is no requirement that the majority or even that a substantial number of apartments be affected. The trial court\\'s conclusion that, despite the plain meaning of the statute, the Board was required to wait to bring suit until \\\\\"a sufficient number\\\\\" of apartment owners were affected is unjustified.\\\\nA statute which is plain needs no construction. King Cy. v. Seattle, 70 Wn.2d 988, 425 P.2d 887 (1967). It is neither the function nor the prerogative of courts to modify legislative enactments. Anderson v. Seattle, 78 Wn.2d 201, 471 P.2d 87 (1970). The trial court\\'s formulation of a requirement of a \\\\\"sufficient number\\\\\" of affected units is not supported by the statute and is unworkably vague. The Board\\'s strategic decision to bring suit at the time that it did will not be aided by this court with a reading not sustained by the language or the spirit of RCW 64.32.240.\\\\nThe trial court\\'s application of the discovery rule is inconsistent with the analysis applied by this court in White v. Johns-Manville Corp., 103 Wn.2d 344, 348, 693 P.2d 687 (1985): \\\\\"[A] cause of action accrues at the time the plaintiff knew or should have known all of the essential elements of the cause of action.\\\\\" Awareness of the essential elements of a cause of action and awareness that one has a cause of action are not necessarily the same, for purposes of a statute of limitation. Sahlie v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 99 Wn.2d 550, 554, 663 P.2d 473 (1983). This court made that distinction in Sahlie to underscore our position that a cause of action accrues when a plaintiff discovers, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered, the elements of the cause of action, and not when the plaintiff realized that they had a legally cognizable injury.\\\\nThe applicable statute of limitations in this lawsuit is 3 years from the date of discovery under RCW 4.16.080(2). That statute should operate, however, as of the time the homeowners actually knew or reasonably should have known of the defects that comprised the elements of their causes of action. The trial court acknowledged that many of the individual homeowners knew and complained of defects as early as 1976. The trial court found that between 1976 and 1980 the owners of 13 units were aware of damage that required repair. The Board was sufficiently concerned by June 1979 to consult a lawyer as to who had the responsibility to repair the deteriorating decks. In the face of this abundant evidence of actual notice to the Board and to the individual apartment owners, the trial court\\'s conclusion that the cause of action did not accrue until December 1980 is unsupported by the record.\\\\nImplied Warranty op Habitability\\\\nThe implied warranty of habitability in Washington is a limited one:\\\\n[W]hen a vendor-builder sells a new house to its first intended occupant, he impliedly warrants that the foundations supporting it are firm and secure and that the house is structurally safe for the buyer\\'s intended purpose of living in it.\\\\nHouse v. Thornton, 76 Wn.2d 428, 436, 457 P.2d 199 (1969). House and progeny have been applied in this state to grant recovery to the first intended occupants for egregious, fundamental defects in homes which, as the name of the warranty indicates, render the houses unfit to be lived in. The plaintiffs in House contended with a house with a foundation so faulty that the basement, walls, floors and foundation slipped and cracked, and the supporting terrain slid away from the foundation.\\\\nThis court has not been anxious to extend the implied warranty of habitability beyond its present boundaries. Frickel v. Sunnyside Enters., 106 Wn.2d 714, 725 P.2d 422 (1986) (court declined to extend implied warranty of habitability to sale of apartment complex despite serious foundation defects and improper construction, where property was not built for resale and sales contract contained express disclaimers of such warranty).\\\\nOther cases in Washington brought under the implied warranty of habitability premise recovery upon proof of defects which profoundly compromise the essential nature of the subject property as a dwelling. Klos v. Gockel, 87 Wn.2d 567, 554 P.2d 1349 (1976) (recovery denied where patio and backyard were damaged by a mud slide and the settling of fill, but house itself suffered only minimal damage); Allen v. Anderson, 16 Wn. App. 446, 557 P.2d 24 (1976) (alleged foundation faults, cracks and bows in retaining walls, dismissed on other grounds); Gay v. Cornwall, 6 Wn. App. 595, 494 P.2d 1371 (1972) (leaks in roof, plumbing defective, sewer pipe dumped raw sewage into crawl space, furnace motor burned out, drain field washed away).\\\\nThe doctrine of implied warranty of habitability imposes liability upon builder-vendors in favor of original purchasers of residential property for egregious defects in the fundamental structure of a home. The warranty does not provide recovery for defects in exterior, nonstructural elements adjacent to the dwelling unit. The instant case involves defects similar to those in Klos v. Gockel, supra. In Klos, a landslide caused damage to the plaintiff\\'s patio, but not to the house itself. The trial court ruled that the slide, while not injuring the foundation, rendered the residence unfit for occupancy, \\\\\"if not in terms of actual danger, then at least in terms of threatening one\\'s peace of mind\\\\\". Klos, at 569. This court overruled that holding, noting that the plaintiffs never moved out of the house and were still occupying it at time of trial. Klos does not support an extension of the doctrine of implied warranty of habitability for mere defects in workmanship. The Klos court denied recovery to the plaintiffs, holding that:\\\\nThe law of implied warranty is not broad enough to make the builder-vendor of a house absolutely liable for all mishaps occurring within the boundaries of the improved real property.\\\\nKlos, at 571-72.\\\\nIn the case at bar, some of the damaged areas were decks, similar in use to the patio area in Klos. Others were walkways that may have comprised the sole means of access to the apartments, although the record fails to make this clear. Finding of fact 15; Clerk\\'s Papers, at 15. As to the access walkways, one could plausibly argue that the defects occurred in an essential portion of the dwelling itself. Unfortunately, the record does not distinguish among the units, and there was no allegation that any apartment owner was prevented from using his or her unit because of the defects. Plaintiff homeowners who were not barred by the statute of limitations could plausibly maintain an action for breach of the implied warranty of habitability, where they were unable to enter their dwelling units safely. Such a defect could be said to render a home unit unfit for its intended purpose. Unfortunately, the record before this court is insufficient for purposes of making such a determination.\\\\nNegligent Construction\\\\nCurrently, the State of Washington does not recognize a cause of action for negligent construction on behalf of individual homeowners. Beyond the terms expressed in the contract of sale, the only recognized duty owing from a builder-vendor of a newly completed residence to its first purchaser is that embodied in the implied warranty of habitability, which arises from the sale transaction. House v. Thornton, supra at 436. Plaintiff homeowners faced with losses that are not of their own making present a sympathetic case, and we understand the desire of the trial court to fashion a remedy. We must exercise caution, however, that we do not unduly upset the law upon which expectations are built and business is conducted.\\\\nThe theory advanced by the trial court is a peculiar combination of tort and contract law, closely related to the tort law of products liability. Comment, Manufacturer\\'s Liability to Remote Purchasers for \\\\\"Economic Loss\\\\\" Damages\\\\u2014 Tort or Contract?, 114 U. Pa. L. Rev. 539 (1966). Dean Prosser characterized the law of products liability as a \\\\\"hybrid, born of the illicit intercourse of tort and contract, unique in the law.\\\\\" W. Prosser, Torts 634 (4th ed. 1971).\\\\nInitially, plaintiffs who suffered personal injuries from defective products could only reach the manufacturer under warranty theories. Courts, however, had difficulty meshing the inapposite \\\\\"intricacies of the law of sales,\\\\\" Prosser, The Assault Upon the Citadel, 69 Yale L.J. 1099 (1960), such as notice and privity, with the plight presented by injured consumers who did not have a direct contractual relationship with the manufacturer. Accordingly, the doctrine fell prey to logical difficulties inherent in this procrustean approach, which addressed problems of unsafe conduct with a legal theory premised on receiving the benefit of a bargain. Pennsylvania Glass Sand Corp. v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 652 F.2d 1165, 1168-69 (3d Cir. 1981).\\\\nThe first cases holding manufacturers liable for injuries caused by their products in the absence of privity of contract used a negligence theory. The landmark decision in this area was MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (1916) (Cardozo, J.). MacPherson has been accepted in every jurisdiction in the United States to provide a remedy to plaintiffs injured by manufactured items that are dangerous if negligently made. W. Prosser, Torts \\\\u00a7 96, at 642-43 (4th ed. 1971). Courts reasoned that privity of contract should not stand as a bar to plaintiff consumers who suffered physical injury from a product negligently made.\\\\nAs a matter of public policy, it is entirely reasonable to expect manufacturers of goods for sale to the general public to assume responsibility for the safety of their product. In Seely v. White Motor Co., 63 Cal. 2d 9, 403 P.2d 145, 45 Cal. Rptr. 17 (1965), Justice Traynor denied recovery to a plaintiff who had pleaded lost profits as the only damages under a negligence theory. Justice Traynor stated at page 18:\\\\nThe distinction that the law has drawn between tort recovery for physical injuries and warranty recovery for economic loss is not arbitrary and does not rest on the \\\\\"luck\\\\\" of one plaintiff in having an accident causing physical injury. The distinction rests, rather, on an understanding of the nature of the responsibility a manufacturer must undertake in distributing his products. He can appropriately be held liable for physical injuries caused by defects by requiring his goods to match a standard of safety defined in terms of conditions that create unreasonable risks of harm. He cannot be held for the level of performance of his products in the consumer\\'s business unless he agrees that the product was designed to meet the consumer\\'s demands. A consumer should not be charged at the will of the manufacturer with bearing the risk of physical injury when he buys a product on the market. He can, however, be fairly charged with the risk that the product will not match his economic expectations unless the manufacturer agrees that it will. . . .\\\\nThis court has acknowledged the extreme confusion in the development of our own case law, and we have, in the past, allowed recovery under a negligence theory for lost profits standing alone (upon proof of causation and breach of duty). Berg v. General Motors Corp., 87 Wn.2d 584, 591, 555 P.2d 818 (1976). In Berg, this court noted the convoluted history of products liability doctrine, conceded that \\\\\"[cjourts are anxious to find some legal theory sufficient to protect the public interest\\\\\", Berg, at 593, and made a policy-based decision to allow damages to a commercial fisherman for the anticipated value of a fish catch that was lost when his boat was laid up for repairs of defendant manufacturer\\'s negligently built motor.\\\\nThe instant case, however, presents a leap beyond the theory applied in Berg. The plaintiffs have alleged no injury beyond the affected areas themselves, and no damages beyond the cost of repair. In its effort to find recovery for the plaintiffs, the trial court formulated a theory of recovery in negligence that overlooks the intricacies and logical inconsistencies inherent in the approach.\\\\nCommentators and courts faced with this issue have found it necessary to distinguish economic loss from physical harm or property damage. The distinction is usually drawn depending on the nature of the defect and the manner in which the damage occurred. Defects of quality are evidenced by internal deterioration, and designated as economic loss, while loss stemming from defects that cause accidents involving violence or collision with external objects is treated as physical injury. Pennsylvania Glass Sand, at 1169-70. See Note, Economic Loss in Products Liability Jurisprudence, 66 Colum. L. Rev. 917, 918 (1966); see also Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 626 F.2d 280 (3d Cir. 1980).\\\\nTort law has traditionally redressed injuries properly classified as physical harm. W. Prosser, Torts \\\\u00a7 101, at 665 (4th ed. 1971). Tort law is concerned with the obligations imposed by law, rather than by bargain. As a matter of public policy, it is appropriate that a duty be imposed on manufacturers to produce products that will not unreasonably endanger the safety and health of the public, whether the ultimate impact of the danger is suffered by people, other property, or on the product itself. In contrast, contract law protects expectation interests, and provides an appropriate set of rules when an individual bargains for a product of particular quality or for a particular use.\\\\nIn cases such as the present one where only the defective product is damaged, the court should identify whether the particular injury amounts to economic loss or physical damage. In drawing the distinction, the determinative factor should not be the items for which damages are sought, such as repair costs. Rather, the line between tort and contract must be drawn by analyzing interrelated factors such as the nature of the defect, the type of risk, and the manner in which the injury arose. These factors bear directly on whether the safety-insurance policy of tort law or the expectation-bargain protection policy of warranty law is most applicable to the claim in question. Pennsylvania Glass Sand, at 1173.\\\\nThe nature of the defect here was that the decks and walkways were not of the quality desired by the buyers. The \\\\\"injury\\\\\" or damage suffered was that the decks themselves deteriorated, not through accident or violent occurrence, but through exposure to the weather.\\\\nThe plaintiffs advanced theories of recovery under the Consumer Protection Act, RCW 19.86, under a theory of misrepresentation, and under the express warranties contained in the contract of sale with the builder-vendor. The trial court correctly held that recovery was not available under any of these theories, and plaintiffs have not appealed those rulings. This is unremarkable, in that the express terms of the contract with the builder-vendor delegated the risks among the parties, and formed part of the basis of their bargain.\\\\nIn its search to provide relief where the contract did not, the trial court stretched the implied warranty of habitability beyond recognition to grant recovery to original purchasers of condominium units. The trial court then accepted the plaintiffs\\' invitation to recognize a poorly reasoned cause of action to grant recovery to subsequent purchasers. The dangers in creating such unreasoned precedent are manifest.\\\\nImposition of tort liability upon the builder-vendors would require them to become the guarantors of the complete satisfaction of future purchasers. A builder-vendor could contract to limit liability for defects with the original purchaser and then find themselves liable for the same defects to a future purchaser with whom they had absolutely no contact. The trial court\\'s formulation makes no distinction between subsequent purchasers who may have known nothing of the potential deterioration of the decks, and those buyers who may have been able to see the flaking observable to the naked eye from the exhibits before the court. The latter buyers may well have been able to account for the defects with an adjustment to the purchase price. As to such buyers, any recovery from the court would be a pure windfall.\\\\nThere is nothing in the trial court\\'s disposition of the case to limit liability for the same defects in the same units to future subsequent purchasers. In a commodity such as condominiums, it is not unthinkable that speculators could sell and resell the property rapidly enough to escape the strictures of the statute of limitations. This court will not sanction such result-oriented jurisprudence, particularly in an area of the law so vitally enmeshed in our economy and dependent on settled expectations as is the construction business. We decline to recognize a cause of action in negligent construction.\\\\nWe reverse and remand to the trial court to determine, consistent with this opinion, (1) which, if any, of the plaintiffs were not barred by the statute of limitations, and (2) which units owned by such plaintiffs had walkways so impaired that the sole means of access to the unit was dangerous to negotiate.\\\\nPearson, C.J., and Brachtenbach, Dolliver, Andersen, Goodloe, and Durham, JJ., concur.\\\\nRCW 64.32.010(6) (b) provides, in pertinent part:\\\\n\\\\\"(6) \\'Common areas and facilities\\', unless otherwise provided in the declaration as duly recorded or as it may be lawfully amended, includes: . . .\\\\n\\\\\"(b) The foundation, columns, girders, beams, supports, main walls, roofs, halls, corridors, lobbys [sic], stairs, stairways, fire escapes, and entrances and exits of the building;\\\\\"\\\\nRCW 64.32.010(11) provides, in pertinent part:\\\\n\\\\\" (11) \\'Limited common areas and facilities\\' includes those common areas and facilities designated in the declaration, as it is duly recorded or as it may be lawfully amended, as reserved for use of certain apartment or apartments to the exclusion of the other apartments.\\\\\"\\\\nColdwelI Banker cross-claimed against Baylis for recovery in the event of a finding of liability for negligent design. Both plaintiffs and Coldwell Banker dropped their claims against Baylis prior to trial. Ferguson apparently went through bankruptcy proceedings some time prior to trial.\",\"type\":\"majority\",\"author\":\"Utter, J. \\\\u2014\"},{\"text\":\"Callow, J.\\\\n(concurring in part, dissenting in part) \\\\u2014 I concur with the majority\\'s discussion of the statute of limitations and the implied warranty of habitability. I dissent, however, from the majority\\'s refusal to recognize a cause of action in negligent construction in a case such as this, where a builder has sold condominiums with latent dangerous defects. The majority reasons that no claim of negligent construction can lie because the purchasers have suffered only \\\\\"economic loss\\\\\". I submit this is unsound and unpersuasive. Purchasers of condominiums who have been the victims of shoddy and unsafe construction practices, yet who have no remedy under the implied warranty of habitability, should not be denied recovery merely because they have been fortunate to escape serious physical injury.\\\\nThe record before us shows that Coldwell Banker built and sold several condominiums with latent dangerous defects, and that such defects were the result of negligent construction. The trial court specifically found:\\\\nIn constructing the deck and railing systems in the complex, Coldwell Banker was negligent in needlessly splicing the rail cap, in failing to provide adequate drainage at the bottom of the enclosed rails and decks, in inadequately flashing the juncture of the deck and the rail wall, in using interior gypsum wallboard inside of the rail structures, rather than exterior gypsum sheathing, especially when accompanied by a failure to protect that interior wallboard by placing adequate building paper over the wallboard and\\\\/or over the top of the inside rail structure to prevent rain or other water coming into the structure through the rail cap.\\\\nAll of the defects, individually or in combination, greatly hastened the rotting of these structures.\\\\nThus, the court concluded:\\\\nAlthough structurally safe for the buyer\\'s intended purpose at the time of construction and initial purchase by individual owners, a number of the [condominiums\\'] private decks, balconies and [access] walkways became unsafe through the action of dry rot trapped as a result of construction defects.\\\\nThe trial court also noted:\\\\nSome of the defects which ultimately led to rotting . . . were not visible, such as lack of ventilation, inadequate flashing or failure to wrap gypsum board with building paper.\\\\nAs the majority points out, some of the affected purchasers may seek recovery for breach of the implied warranty of habitability. This provides but limited relief. The implied warranty of habitability protects only the first intended occupants of new condominiums, and covers only structural defects which render the condominium uninhabitable. Frickel v. Sunnyside Enters., 106 Wn.2d 714, 715-18, 725 P.2d 422 (1986); Klos v. Gockel, 87 Wn.2d 567, 571-72, 554 P.2d 1349 (1976); House v. Thornton, 76 Wn.2d 428, 436, 457 P.2d 199 (1969). It does not provide a remedy for subsequent purchaser\\\\/occupants; nor for original purchaser\\\\/ occupants of condominiums with dangerously defective decks or balconies (as opposed to access walkways), since these structures do not render the dwelling itself \\\\\"uninhabitable.\\\\\" I find no reason to cut off a subsequent purchaser from a remedy in such a situation just because the property has changed hands twice rather than only once.\\\\nThe purchaser of a condominium has the right to expect that it will be properly constructed and free of latent and dangerous defects of any kind. As explained in Oates v. JAG, Inc., 314 N.C. 276, 333 S.E.2d 222 (1985):\\\\nWe must be realistic. The ordinary purchaser of a home is not qualified to determine when or where a defect exists. Yet, the purchaser makes the biggest and most important investment in his or her life and, more times than not, on a limited budget. The purchaser can ill afford to suddenly find a latent defect in his or her home . . . and have no remedy for recourse. This happens too often. The careless work of contractors, who in the past have been insulated from liability, must cease or they must accept financial responsibility for their negligence. In our judgment, building contractors should be held to the general standard of reasonable care for the protection of anyone who may foreseeably be endangered by their negligence.\\\\nOates, at 280-81 (quoting Simmons v. Owens, 363 So. 2d 142, 143 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1978).\\\\nI would join the growing number of jurisdictions that recognize a cause of action for negligent construction. See, e.g., Oates; Council of Co-Owners Atlantis Condominium, Inc. v. Whiting-Turner Contracting Co., 308 Md. 18, 517 A.2d 336 (1986); Cosmopolitan Homes, Inc. v. Weller, 663 P.2d 1041 (Colo. 1983); Kristek v. Catron, 7 Kan. App. 2d 495, 644 P.2d 480 (1982); Velotta v. Leo Petronzio Landscaping, Inc., 69 Ohio St. 2d 376, 433 N.E.2d 147 (1982); Juliano v. Gaston, 187 N.J. Super. 491, 455 A.2d 523 (1982); Drexel Properties, Inc. v. Bay Colony Club Condominium, Inc., 406 So. 2d 515 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1981); Terlinde v. Neely, 275 S.C. 395, 271 S.E.2d 768, 10 A.L.R.4th 379 (1980); Moxley v. Laramie Builders, Inc., 600 P.2d 733 (Wyo. 1979); Brown v. Fowler, 279 N.W.2d 907 (S.D. 1979); Sabella v. Wisler, 59 Cal. 2d 21, 377 P.2d 889, 27 Cal. Rptr. 689 (1963); Fisher v. Simon, 15 Wis. 2d 207, 112 N.W.2d 705 (1961). I would hold that a purchaser may bring a claim for negligent construction against the builder-vendor of a home if the home has a latent and dangerous defect which creates a risk of personal injury. Hopefully, of course, the dangerous condition will be detected before personal injury actually occurs. In such a case, the purchaser\\'s recovery would consist of the reasonable cost of correcting the dangerous condition.\\\\nThe majority rejects this alternative, reasoning that absent physical injury or property damage, the purchaser has suffered only \\\\\"economic loss\\\\\" and thus is barred from recovery in tort. This view of negligence law has been rejected by numerous other courts. Most recently, the Maryland Supreme Court approved precisely the cause of action in negligent construction outlined above. The court added that where a latent and dangerously defective condition exists, economic loss alone is not a bar to recovery. The court said:\\\\nThe contention that a distinction should be drawn between mere \\\\\"economic loss\\\\\" and personal injury is without merit. . . .\\\\nIf there is a defect in a stairway and the purchaser repairs the defect and suffers an economic loss, should he fail to recover because he did not wait until he or some member of his family fell down the stairs and broke his neck? Does the law penalize those who are alert and prevent injury? Should it not put those who prevent personal injury on the same level as those who fail to anticipate it?\\\\nCouncil of Co-Owners Atlantis Condominium, at 34-35, quoting Barnes v. Mac Brown & Co., 264 Ind. 227, 230, 342 N.E.2d 619 (1976). The additional cases cited likewise reject any distinction between personal injury and economic loss in the context of a negligent construction claim.\\\\nRecognizing a cause of action in negligent construction affords purchasers of homes or condominiums a remedy for dangerous and shoddy construction without imposing an undue burden on builder-vendors. Since this cause of action sounds in tort, the remedy extends to both original and subsequent purchasers (i.e., privity of contract with the builder-vendor is not required). However, the builder-vendor\\'s potential liability is not unlimited, for the statute of limitations expressly bars commencement of any suit that does not accrue within 6 years of substantial completion of construction. See RCW 4.16.310. Moreover, a purchaser who brings a claim for negligent construction, but who suffers economic loss alone, must prove (1) negligence on the part of the builder-vendor caused a defective condition, (2) the defective condition is dangerous, (3) the defective condition was latent at the time of purchase. As explained in Cosmopolitan Homes, at 1045-46:\\\\nThe reason for allowing recovery only for latent or hidden defects, which have been defined as \\\\\"those manifesting themselves after purchase and which are not discoverable through reasonable inspection,\\\\\" ... is to prevent an action where mere deterioration or loss of a bargain is claimed. . . . Often a buyer is willing to accept certain deficiencies in a house in exchange for a lower purchase price. However, a buyer cannot be expected to discover structural defects which remain latent at the time of purchase.\\\\nIf a purchaser meets these requirements, there is no reason why he should not recover from the builder-vendor for negligent construction. The alternative offered by the majority is to subject the purchaser to the outworn and antiquated doctrine of caveat emptor. This court should find such an alternative unacceptable.\\\\nI would remand to the trial court to determine first, which plaintiffs are barred from recovery by the statute of limitations; second, which plaintiffs have stated a valid claim for breach of the implied warranty of habitability; and third, which plaintiffs have stated a valid claim for negligent construction as outlined above. I respectfully dissent to the extent that my proposed resolution of this case differs from that of the majority.\\\\nDore, J., concurs with Callow, J.\",\"type\":\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\",\"author\":\"Callow, J.\"}],\"attorneys\":[\"Davis, Wright, Todd, Riese & Jones, by Duncan A.

The building was constructed in 1923 or 1924, and has for many years been used for garage purposes. It is now known as the Paramount Garage. On March 28, 1946, the company leased the building to August H. Wenck, Ezra Royce and Barney Royce, copartners, doing business as Gray Line Tours. The lessees will be hereinafter referred to in the singular as lessee, defendant, or respondent.\\\\nThe lease was for a term of one and one-half years, commencing July 1, 1946, and ending December 31, 1947. A monthly rental of three hundred fifty dollars was stipulated in the lease. The building, which was about twenty-three years old at the time the lease was entered into, was then in a bad state of repair. These conditions were known to the lessee before the lease was executed. Shortly after taking possession, the lessee expended in excess of three thousand dollars in making repairs and adding improvements to the building. During the term of the lease, the street level floor was used by the lessee as a private garage. The basement level was sublet, with the consent of the lessor, to one Jensen, who used it as a public garage and automobile repair shop.\\\\nOn December 20, 1947, ten days before the expiration of the term, the lessor\\\\u2019s attorneys wrote to the lessee, calling attention to paragraphs (5) and (6) of the lease, and stating that\\\\n\\\\u201c . . . you are required under these paragraphs to do a large amount of work on the premises before the expiration of your lease.\\\\u201d\\\\nParagraph (5) of the lease pertains to repairs and maintenance and the condition in which the premises were to be when returned to the lessor. Paragraph (6) requires the lessee to \\\\u201ckeep and use said premises in accordance with applicable laws and ordinances.\\\\u201d The letter of December 20th suggested that a conference be held to discuss the matter. It is stated in the letter that there had been previous discussions of the matter, but this is denied by the lessee.\\\\nThe lessee vacated the premises at the end of the term without having made any of the repairs demanded in the letter of December 20, 1947. Shortly thereafter the lessor instituted this action. The complaint states two causes of action, only the first of which is involved in this appeal. Paragraph YII of the complaint lists eighteen items of work which, it is alleged, defendant should have done under paragraphs (5) and (6) of the lease. Damages in the sum of $15,309 (not itemized) were alleged to result from defendant\\\\u2019s failure to do this work. An additional one hundred dollars was claimed by reason of defendant\\\\u2019s alleged action in removing and storing a certain neon sign.\\\\nThe matter came on for trial before the court without a jury. Extensive testimony and numerous exhibits were received. We make brief reference to the individual items, for the purpose of indicating the character of the claims and the principal mitigating factors relied upon by defendant.\\\\nItems Nos. 1 to 3, as listed in the complaint, called for the installation of electrical equipment\\\\u2014conduit, wire, boxes and fixtures\\\\u2014which was wholly lacking when defendant took possession. Plaintiff contended that the second and third of these items were required to comply with the electric code of the city of Seattle. Item No. 4 called for the replacement of an electrical panel and the repair of electrical switches. The evidence was in conflict as to whether this equipment was in working condition when defendant surrendered the premises.\\\\nItem No. 5 called for the installation of a new automatic sprinkler system in the basement, at a cost of $3,543.19, to replace one which was old, obsolete and not usable when defendant took possession. Plaintiff asserted that this installation was necessary to comply with the city building code. Item No. 6 related to glass breakage. Item No. 7 called for painting the interior of the premises, at a cost of $870. A good part of the interior had apparently been painted several years before. Defendant produced evidence to the effect that such interior painting in garage buildings of this class is unnecessary and serves no useful purpose as a protective measure or otherwise.\\\\nItem No. 8 called for the repair of the ramp door to make it self-closing. Plaintiff contended that this work was necessary in order to comply with the city building code. The evidence does not reveal whether this door had been self-closing at any time during the lease. Item No. 9 called for the repair of wood floor and beams at the north door on the main floor. Item No. 10, involving an expenditure of $1,-593.77, called for the installation of a rolling fire door between the auto repair shop and the garage in the basement. It was claimed that this installation was necessary to comply with the building code. Item No. 11 was waived by plaintiff.\\\\nItem No. 12 involved the replacement of both first floor front doors at a cost of $843.34. Defendant\\\\u2019s witness testified that these doors could be repaired at small cost. Item No. 13 related to the replacement of the basement door at the alley. Defendant at no time used this door and it was nailed up throughout the term of the lease. Plaintiff\\\\u2019s witness estimated the cost of a new door at $339.49. Defendant\\\\u2019s witness estimated the cost of replacing the door at from $150 to $175.\\\\nItem No. 14 called for the removal of existing partitions for the basement toilet, the installation of new partitions, and rebuilding and installing a sheet metal duct. It was not definitely established whether this facility was in the building at the time defendant took possession. There did not seem to be any evidence of disrepair, but it was.asserted that these changes were necessary to comply with the building code.\\\\nUnder item No. 15, plaintiff claimed $57.12 as the cost of removing certain rubbish. Witnesses for defendant denied that this was defendant\\\\u2019s rubbish and also minimized the work involved in obtaining its removal. Items Nos. 16 and 18 called for structural repairs consisting of the replacement of columns, beams and joists. The total amount claimed under these two items was $1,995.31. Item No. 17 called for the replacement of two thousand square feet of flooring in the north section of the building. The testimony was in conflict as to the state of repair of most of the flooring. Defendant\\\\u2019s witnesses testified that the flooring, as repaired by defendant, was adequate for the normal purposes of the building.\\\\nThe evidence showed that the conditions requiring these repairs, with the possible exception of some of the glass, existed at the time the lease was signed and were due to decay and wear and tear which had already taken place; that many of the repairs were of a more or less permanent nature; that some of them have structural characteristics; that some items pertain more to improvements than to replacements or repairs; and that most, if not all, of them were principally for the benefit of the lessor.\\\\nThe evidence further showed that the building was in better condition at the end of the lease term than it was at the beginning. There had been some wear and tear during the term (excepted in the covenant to repair), and some glass breakage, for which the court allowed recovery. On the other hand, the condition of the building had been substantially bettered by the repairs and improvements which defendant made at the beginning of the lease.\\\\nSeveral experienced garagemen testified that this building would be classified as a third-class garage. According to this testimony, a first-class garage is one with concrete walls and floors, electrically operated doors, and wider ramps and more convenient arrangements throughout. Except with respect to compliance with certain laws and ordinances, the testimony was uncontradicted that the building, as repaired by defendant at the commencement of the term, was in an adequate state of repair to meet all the reasonable needs and requirements of defendant.\\\\nThe evidence also showed that, after defendant vacated the premises, plaintiff had all of the repairs made, as listed in the complaint and set out above, except items Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7,11, and 14. On the basis of the testimony as to the actual cost of the repairs made, and the estimated cost of repairs not made, plaintiff during the trial reduced its demand from $15,409 to $10,933.89. This included an allowance of $148.32 instead of the originally claimed one hundred dollars for removal of the neon sign. It included no allowance under item No. 11, as plaintiff waived that claim. At the close of plaintiff\\\\u2019s case, defendant admitted liability in the amount of three hundred fifty dollars, and deposited that amount in the registry of the court.\\\\nThe trial court took the case under advisement at the close of the trial on May 4, 1949. On August 26, 1949, a comprehensive memorandum decision was filed, in which the facts and applicable law were reviewed at length. The trial court allowed full recovery on items Nos. 6 and 9 and the $148.32 damages claimed for removal of the neon sign. The trial court also allowed fifty dollars of the $843.34 claimed under item No. 12; one hundred twenty-five dollars of the $339.49 claimed under item No. 13; and fifteen dollars of the $57.12 claimed under item No. 15. The remaining items were entirely disallowed. Findings of fact, conclusions of law and judgment for plaintiff in the sum of $738.53 were thereupon entered. Plaintiff has appealed, and defendant has cross-appealed.\\\\nAppellant\\\\u2019s assignments of error present two principal questions. The first of these is whether paragraph (5) of the lease required respondent to make the repairs as listed in the complaint to an extent greater than recognized in the judgment entered. This paragraph of the lease reads as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201c (5) Unless otherwise provided in this lease, lessee, having ascertained the physical condition of said premises from a careful and complete inspection thereof, accepts said premises in present condition, no exceptions. At the commencement of the term of this lease lessee shall place and thereafter shall keep and maintain said premises in a neat, clean and sanitary condition and in a first class state of repair, all at lessee\\\\u2019s expense; provided, however, that lessee\\\\u2019s obligation to repair shall not extend to the outside walls, roof and foundation of the building, if any there be, in which said premises are located unless repairs thereto be necessitated by lessee\\\\u2019s negligence. Pursuant to said obligation lessee shall promptly replace any glass in or hereafter installed in said premises whether the same be in windows, the front, doors or other places, which becomes broken or damaged, provided, however, that if lessee at lessee\\\\u2019s expense takes out and maintains insurance against breakage and damage of said glass in an amount and in a company satisfactory to lessor or agent and lessor is named as the assured in the policy, then lessee shall be relieved of the obligation of replacing broken or damaged glass. At the expiration of the term of this lease or its earlier termination, lessee shall redeliver possession of said premises to lessor and lessee covenants and agrees that at the time of said expiration or termination said premises will be in the best physical condition in which they were at any time during the lease term, ordinary wear and tear and damage by fire not caused by lessee\\\\u2019s negligence and other casualty not so caused, excepted.\\\\u201d\\\\nIt will be observed that the above-quoted paragraph contains three provisions, the first relating to the condition of the premises when the lessee takes possession; the second relating to the lessee\\\\u2019s duty to repair and maintain the premises; and the third relating to the condition the premises are to be in when returned at the end of the term. The issue before us brings into question only the second provision, relating to the lessee\\\\u2019s duty to repair and maintain the premises. To the extent that the lessee had such a duty, then it was concededly obligated, under the third provision, to turn back the premises in the state of repair called for.\\\\nUnder the second provision of paragraph (5), respondent covenanted that at the commencement of the term it would \\\\u201cplace\\\\u201d and thereafter \\\\u201ckeep and maintain\\\\u201d the premises in a .neat, clean and sanitary condition and in a \\\\u201cfirst class state of repair\\\\u201d; it being provided that such obligation to repair did not extend to outside walls, roof and foundation of the building, unless such repairs were\\\\\" necessitated by respondent\\\\u2019s negligence.\\\\nAppellant contends that all of the repairs listed in the complaint (except item No. 11 which was waived) were necessary in order to place the building in a \\\\u201cfirst class\\\\u201d state of repair. Respondent, on the other hand, contends that it made all repairs at the beginning of the term which were necessary to place the building in a \\\\u201cfirst class state\\\\u201d of repair. The primary issue on this branch of the case, therefore, is the construction to be given the term \\\\u201cfirst class state of repair\\\\u201d as used in this lease.\\\\nIt is perfectly competent for the parties to a lease to place upon the lessee the obligation of making very substantial and even structural repairs at the commencement of, or during the course of, the lease term. Such a covenant may call for repairs not necessary to the lessee\\\\u2019s use of the premises, and of primary benefit to the lessor. However, when this is the intention, the covenant is usually specific in itemizing the work to be done. Here there was no itemization of repairs to be made by the lessee at the commencement of the term, except with respect to glass breakage. The trial court allowed this item in full.\\\\nThe making of repairs which will substantially improve the condition and value of the premises, when required under the covenants of a lease, constitutes a part of the benefit the lessor expects to derive from the lease, along with the payment of rentals. Accordingly, where a comprehensive covenant of this kind is intended, there is usually a provision giving the tenant free occupancy for a specified period, or some indication that stipulated monthly payments have been lessened because of the other benefits the lessor is to receive. For example, the lease involved in Yakima Valley Motors v. Webb Tractor & Equipment Co., 14 Wn. (2d) 468, 128 P. (2d) 507, recites that, in consideration of no monthly installments being required until a specified date, the tenant would spend not less than one thousand dollars in cleaning up the premises and making specified repairs and replacements. A year\\\\u2019s rental of a six-year term was thus waived.\\\\nIn the instant case the lease does not waive rentals for any part of the term, or in any other way indicate that the monthly rentals were reduced in consideration of the lessee making substantial repairs for the primary benefit of the lessor. The reserved rental of three hundred fifty dollars a month amounts to $6,300 for the eighteen-months term. Appellant now claims an additional $10,933.89 because of respondent\\\\u2019s failure to -make such repairs. This would increase appellant\\\\u2019s monetary benefits under the lease one hundred seventy-three per cent above the total rental for the term. In reviewing a similar contention in Second United Cities Realty Corp. v. Price & Schumacher Co., 242 N. Y. 120, 124, 151 N. E. 150, where the cost of the repairs would have about equalled the total reserved rent, the court said:\\\\n\\\\u201cThat such a liability was to be cast upon the tenant by. this lease could hardly have been within the contemplation of the parties.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe term \\\\u201cfirst class state of repair\\\\u201d has no precise and generally recognized meaning applicable under any and all circumstances. The meaning to be ascribed to such a term is to be drawn not only from a study of the leasing instrument, but also from a consideration of the surrounding circumstances; the type, age and condition of the building; the uses to which it is adapted; the use which the lessee is to make of the building; the character of repairs in question; and the lessee\\\\u2019s need of such repairs. See Codman v. Hygrade Food Products Corp., 295 Mass. 195, 3 N. E. (2d) 759, 106 A. L. R. 1354, where the court was called upon to construe the somewhat similar terms \\\\u201cin good tenantable repair\\\\u201d and \\\\u201cin good condition.\\\\u201d See, also, 32 Am. Jur. 675, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a7 790; and the annotations in 45 A. L. R. 12 and 106 A. L. R. 1358.\\\\nIn the instant case the building has long been used only as a public or private garage; it was in a somewhat dilapidated condition when respondent took possession; respondent expended on repairs and improvements a sum equal to almost half of the reserved rent for the entire term; the testimony is uncontradicted that, as so repaired, the building was entirely satisfactory for respondent\\\\u2019s purposes. The trial court concluded that, under those circumstances, the repairs which were made (except as to items for which additional allowance was made) placed the building in a \\\\u201cfirst class state of repair\\\\u201d within the meaning of paragraph (5) of the lease.\\\\nWe are in accord with the trial court\\\\u2019s conclusions. Courts will not extend or enlarge the obligation of a lessee beyond the plain meaning of the language used and the intention existing at the time it was made. Armstrong v. Maybee, 17 Wash. 24, 48 Pac. 737, 61 Am. St. 898; Anderson v. Ferguson, 17 Wn. (2d) 262, 135 P. (2d) 302; 51 C. J. S. 1087, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a7 368. Ambiguities in a lease must be resolved in favor of the lessee. Anderson v. Ferguson, supra. Moreover, since the instrument was prepared by the lessor, it must be construed most strongly in favor of the lessee. King v. Richards-Cunningham Co., 46 Wyo. 355, 28 P. (2d) 492.\\\\nApplying these familiar rules of construction, we are of the view that the term \\\\u201cfirst class state of repair,\\\\u201d as here used, meant only such repairs as were reasonably necessary for the conduct of a private or public garaging business during the lease term in the kind of building in question. The items of repair which were disallowed did not fall in this category\\\\u2014some were improvements instead of repairs; some were suitable to a modern first-class garage but not to a third-class garage; some were structural repairs beneficial to the lessor but not required for the purposes of the lessee during the term of the lease. Where items were allowed in part, we have examined the record, and conclude that the preponderance of the evidence does not call for revision.\\\\nIn reaching this conclusion we have not overlooked the five decisions of this court cited and relied upon by appellant. These are Armstrong v. Maybee, supra; Arnold-Evans Co. v. Hardung, 132 Wash. 426, 232 Pac. 290, 45 A. L. R. 9; Yakima Valley Motors v. Webb Tractor & Equipment Co., supra; Anderson v. Ferguson, supra; and Publishers Bldg. Co. v. Miller, 25 Wn. (2d) 927, 172 P. (2d) 489.\\\\nThe Yakima Valley Motors case is the only one of these involving a covenant requiring the lessee not only to maintain the building in the condition received, but to substantially improve the condition of the premises for the primary benefit of the lessor. It was there found that the lessee had made the required improvements, but had thereafter permitted the building to become run down during the term of the lease, and had returned the building in that condition to the lessor. Since this was a breach of the covenant to return the building in its repaired condition, the lessee was held liable. There was no question as to what repairs were required of the lessee\\\\u2014they were specified in the lease. Nor was there any question as to whether the lessee had originally made the required repairs. In both of these particulars the Yakima case is distinguishable from the instant case.\\\\nThe four other cases involved only the obligation of the lessee to make repairs made necessary by conditions arising during the lease term. It was the general holding in these cases that, in the absence of any qualifying language, a general covenant of a tenant to repair obligates him to make all repairs necessitated by conditions arising during the term, even to the point of rebuilding in case the premises are destroyed. In the Anderson case it was held that this common-law rule is harsh and should not be applied unless the language of the lease clearly requires it. In the instant case, unlike the four cases last referred to, there is no question as to repairs made necessary by fire, explosion or other catastrophe, or by wear and tear, occurring during the lease term. Hence the general common-law rule announced and applied in those cases has no application here. In our view, none of these five cited cases is pertinent to the issue before us.\\\\nWe therefore hold that paragraph (5) of the lease did not require respondent to make repairs to a greater extent than recognized in the judgment entered.\\\\nThe other question presented by appellant\\\\u2019s assignments of error is whether paragraph (6) of the lease required respondent to make repairs to an extent greater than recognized in the judgment under review.\\\\nAs indicated in the summary of the individual items set out above, appellant contends that the repairs listed under items Nos. 2, 3, 5, 8,10 and 14 were called for not only under paragraph (5) of the lease, relating specifically to repairs, but also under paragraph (6), requiring compliance with applicable laws and ordinances. This latter paragraph of the lease reads as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201c (6) Lessee shall at all times keep and use said premises in accordance with applicable laws and ordinances and in accordance with applicable directions, rules and regulations of public officials and departments, at the sole expense of lessee. Lessee shall not overload and shall permit no waste of, or damage or injury to the premises and at lessee\\\\u2019s sole expense shall keep all drainage pipes free and open, shall protect water, heating and other pipes so that they do not freeze or become clogged, and shall repair all leaks in said pipes. Lessee shall pay all damages caused by the failure of lessee to perform any of the foregoing obligations. Lessee shall further keep all sidewalks and areaways abutting upon said premises free and clear of snow, ice and obstructions.\\\\u201d\\\\nRepresentatives of the Seattle fire department inspected the premises from time to time. On October 10, 1947, less than three months before the expiration of the term, the fire department sent letters to respondent and his subtenant, Jensen. These letters called attention to certain conditions asserted to be in violation of city ordinances. The letter sent to respondent lists eight items, only one of which is involved in this action. This is the matter of covering unused flue openings, and was the item No. 11 listed in the complaint. Item No. 11 was waived by appellant during the course of the trial. The letter to Jensen also lists eight items, three of them corresponding to items Nos. 5, 8 and 10, as listed in the complaint.\\\\nThe fire department letters mention nothing in connection with items Nos. 2, 3 and 14 of the complaint, which appellant also contends involved ordinance violations. However, for present purposes we will assume that all of the items of the complaint referred to on this branch of the case involve work which was required in order for the lessee to fully and strictly comply with applicable laws and ordinances of the city of Seattle.\\\\nThere is no question but that, if city authorities had forbidden respondent\\\\u2019s use of the premises until these corrections were made, respondent would have had the responsibility of making such changes if it desired to continue using the premises. It is also clear that if respondent\\\\u2019s violation of applicable laws and ordinances bad occasioned appellant any expense in the nature of fines, abatement proceedings, or the like, respondent would have been obliged to reimburse appellant. These obligations of the lessee are definitely established by paragraph (6) of the lease.\\\\nBut here the lessee has been able to make such use of the premises as it desired without strict compliance with such laws and ordinances. The letters from the fire department referred to only three of the six items now at issue, and as to them the lessee and its subtenant were not ordered to cease operations until the changes were made. They were only asked to give these matters their \\\\u201cearliest attention.\\\\u201d Had the changes been immediately undertaken, it is doubtful it they could have been completed before the end of the lease term.\\\\nAppellant, as owner and lessor, has been subjected to no penalty or expense because of respondent\\\\u2019s assumed violation of such laws. It is true that appellant will have to make these changes itself, at its own expense, if it desires to now operate the building as a garage. Appellant has, in fact, made these changes since the end of the term, except as to items Nos. 2 and 14. But this expense has not been occasioned by respondent\\\\u2019s violation of the laws and ordinances, and would have been required even if the property had stood vacant and unleased during the actual term of the lease.\\\\nWe do not believe that a covenant of this kind should be construed as an affirmative obligation to repair, alter or improve. It is intended only to place upon the lessee rather than the lessor the responsibility for making any such repairs, alterations or improvements which the lessee finds necessary in order to enjoy the use of the premises; to indemnify the lessor for any expenses resulting directly from unlawful use of the premises; and to provide the lessor with a basis for requiring the lessee to cease any unlawful activity which may occasion expense for the lessor or damage to the reversion.\\\\nAppellant has cited Lodge Room Co. v. Pacific Bond & Inv. Co., 84 Wash. 150, 146 Pac. 376, in support of its position. The lease there in question contained a clause prohibiting the tenant from carrying on any business not in conformity with law. The tenant found that, under applicable laws, it would be impossible to utilize the upper floor of the building until a fire escape was constructed. The tenant built the fire escape and then brought an action against the landlord for reimbursement. Judgment was entered for the tenant. We reversed because the lease itself made it plain that some alterations would be necessary to fit the premises for the proposed use, and that the tenant would pay for such alterations. Thus the case turned principally on a specific covenant to make initial repairs, and only incidentally on the \\\\u2022 covenant to conform with law. The tenant in the Lodge Room Co. case was forced, by the authorities, to make the improvement before it could use the premises. It did make that improvement. There was, accordingly, no question presented as to the tenant\\\\u2019s liability for the cost of repairs or alterations not made during the term.\\\\nSpeaking of the covenants requiring compliance with the orders of civil authorities, it is said in Corpus Juris Secundum:\\\\n\\\\u201cCourts are loath to extend provision of this character beyond their legitimate sphere, so that they have been held not to include a structural change, or extraordinary and unforeseen building alterations,, or such as would be tantamount to a reconstruction of the building itself, or such as are not within the terms of the covenant as properly construed.\\\\u201d 51 C. J. S. 1096, Landlord and Tenant, \\\\u00a7 368.\\\\nWe conclude that paragraph (6) of the lease in question does not obligate respondent to reimburse appellant for the cost of any of the repairs or alterations specified in items Nos. 2, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 14, of paragraph VII of the complaint.\\\\nRespondent has cross-appealed, contending that the trial court erred in allowing recovery on any item except No. 6, relating to replacement of sixty pieces of glass. Respondent does not challenge the other allowances on their merits. On the contrary, respondent states in its brief:\\\\n\\\\u201cIn all fairness, however, it must be conceded that the disposition of the case made by the trial court seems reasonable and just.\\\\u201d\\\\nBut respondent asserts that appellant should have given notice and made demand on respondent prior to the trial with respect to the individual items of repair. Had such demand been made, respondent argues, it would have enabled respondent to discharge such obligation without being subjected to the inconvenience and expense of litigation.\\\\nThe lease in question contained no provision requiring notice and demand by the lessor relative to damages resulting from breached covenants. The letter of December 20, 1947, gave general notice that repair work was required pursuant to paragraphs (5) and (6) of the lease. Although the letter invited a conference on the matter, it drew no written response and no conference was held. It seems doubtful, under the circumstances, whether any more specific notice or demand would have been fruitful.\\\\nWhere a demand before suit would avail nothing, commencing suit is a sufficient demand. Hopkins v. International Lbr. Co., 33 Wash. 181, 73 Pac. 1113; Kimball v. Farmers\\\\u2019 & Mechanics\\\\u2019 Bank, 50 Wash. 610, 97 Pac. 748; 1 C. J. S. 1067, 1068, Actions, \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 26, 27. The assignments of error on the cross-appeal are without merit.\\\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\\\nSimpson, C.

Fleenor and his wife, instituted this action to recover for the damage they suffered when the refrigeration locker plant which they installed in the basement of their store building froze the ground underneath the floor causing the building to buckle and necessitating the closing of the plant.\\\\nOriginal defendants to the action were Wood Conversion Company, a foreign corporation; Paul L. Proctor, sales representative for that company, and his wife; E. G. Erickson and Neis G. Lindh, copartners under the firm name of Edmonds Lumber Company, and their respective wives.\\\\nThe latter partnership and the partners\\\\u2019 wives interposed a demurrer and motion to strike, directed to plaintiffs\\\\u2019 second amended complaint, which were granted. The plaintiffs refusing to amend further, the court at the beginning of the trial, entered an order of dismissal without prejudice as to these parties. Wood Conversion Company appeared specially and moved to quash the service on the ground that it was not a corporation doing business in this state. This motion was denied. A trial before the court and\\' a jury resulted in a verdict and judgment in favor of the defendants Proctor and Wood Conversion Company. Plaintiffs\\\\u2019 motion for a new trial having been denied, judgment was entered dismissing the action. This appeal has been taken from the order dismissing the partnership from the case and from the judgment entered upon the verdict dismissing the case as to the remaining defendants.\\\\nIn 1946 appellants purchased property on the MukilteoEverett highway in Snohomish county with the intention of constructing thereon a building thirty-five by fifty feet consisting of a locker plant in the basement, a grocery store on the first floor and an apartment upstairs. Appellants had had no experience in constructing a refrigeration plant, engaged no architect, and the only plans used were those consisting of very rough sketches of the apartment upstairs and the grocery store, prepared by Fleenor himself. The term \\\\u201cappellant\\\\u201d will be used to refer to appellant husband.\\\\nIn January, 1946, the foundation was dug with a bulldozer and sloped toward the rear of the building for drainage purposes. The basement forms were put in by appellant with the help of his half-brother and stepfather. Concrete was poured into the forms by a sand and gravel company. Drain tile was laid in a trench around the outside walls and another trench through the middle of the basement. The joints were covered with tar paper and all the drain tile was covered with a heavy layer of gravel. Gravel several inches deep was then placed over the entire surface of the basement and a concrete floor was poured over the gravel. Carpenters were hired to complete the building.\\\\nShortly after construction was commenced, appellant visited Edmonds Lumber Company to inquire about insulating material for the locker plant in the basement. The testimony of appellant and the two partners conflict with reference to what was said on that occasion. Appellant testified that he informed the partners that he wanted insulating material for a locker plant and that they recommended Balsam Wool, a product of respondent Wood Conversion Company, and informed him that if he purchased, this product, he would be furnished with a reliable refrigeration engineer to help lay out the locker plant. Appellant gave them the size of the locker plant and the partners determined what quantity would be needed.\\\\nMr. Erickson and Mr. Lindh (the partners) both testified that appellant came into their store and ordered a specific amount of Balsam Wool and wanted to know how to install it. The partners deny that they either recommended the product or determined the quantity. Appellant was told that they knew nothing about the installation of this material but that they would inquire from the local jobber in Seattle and pass any suggestions along to appellant. Upon inquiring from this jobber Mr. Lindh was told that respondent Proctor would be available to advise appellant as to how to use the material.\\\\nShortly after this conversation took place, appellant received a letter from Edmonds Lumber Company dated February 15, 1946, reading as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cIn regard to your millwork order as per our conversation the first of the week, we find that we can fill the order as specified for two hundred ninety two dollars and forty seven cents ($292.47) plus tax cash on delivery at our warehouse.\\\\n\\\\u201cWe will supply double thick Balsam wool in the quantity you need for sixty three dollars ($63.00) per thousand sqr. feet, on the same terms.\\\\n\\\\u201cEnclosed you will find a folder giving cold storage construction details, using Balsam-wool and Nu-wood.\\\\n\\\\u201cIn the event that it is our privilege to supply these materials, we will have a factory representative go to your job to give you help that only a man with his qualifications and experience can give.\\\\u201d\\\\nEnclosed with the letter was a folder containing \\\\u201cCold Storage Construction Details, insulated with Balsam Wool & Nu-wood.\\\\u201d\\\\nAppellant testified that he paid no attention to the enclosed folder since he planned on depending upon the advice of the factory representative. Later he gave the Edmonds Lumber Company an order for Balsam Wool and thereafter placed a second order, the total paid by him for this insulating material being $509.\\\\nAfter a quantity of this insulating material had been delivered to appellants\\\\u2019 building, but before the basement floor was laid, respondent Proctor, at the instance of the Edmonds Lumber Company, visited the building and told appellant that he was from the Wood Conversion Company and at the same time handed appellant his card which identified Proctor as a \\\\u201csales representative.\\\\u201d Appellant testified that he didn\\\\u2019t read the card but put it in his pocket. Appellant called his carpenters together and introduced the respondent as a \\\\u201crefrigeration engineer.\\\\u201d Respondent doesn\\\\u2019t deny being so introduced but does deny that he represented himself as being a \\\\u201crefrigeration engineer.\\\\u201d During the first visit, which lasted about half an hour, the discussion concerned itself with how to properly fasten the insulating material to the floor.\\\\nAbout thirty days later respondent Proctor again visited the job and remained less than an hour. The work was considerably advanced by this time, the basement floor had been poured and part of one layer (2 inches) of Balsam Wool had been put on the floor. It was apparent that after putting one layer of insulation on the floor there would be a quantity remaining. Respondent Proctor was asked whether this additional insulation should be put on the floor or the ceiling and he Suggested that it be put on the ceiling rather than on the floor since the grocery store floor above would be quite warm. Appellant accordingly placed one layer of Balsam Wool on the floor and two layers on the ceiling.\\\\nThe locker plant was put in operation on September 14, 1946, and the grocery store was opened the following December. Soon after the store was opened, appellant noticed that something was wrong with the structure because the doors in the living quarters upstairs began to stick. Upon examination of the building, it was discovered that the locker plant floor was heaving upward in the center and that this was due to the fact that the ground underneath the floor was frozen. The swelling continued to such an extent that the top row of lockers had to be removed to keep them from being forced through the floor of the\\' grocery store above. Finally appellant determined that it wasn\\\\u2019t safe to operate the plant while in this condition and so the locker plant was shut down in May, 1947. The ground then began to thaw, and while the building came down somewhat, it did not return to its normal position.\\\\nAccording to appellant\\\\u2019s expert witnesses the freezing the ground was due to insufficient insulation. According to respondents\\\\u2019 expert witness the freezing was due to insufficient ventilation under the concrete floor, since the ground upon which the locker plant was constructed was wet. His testimony was that if two layers of Balsam Wool had been put on the floor (instead of one) the freezing would have occurred later than it did but the damage would have been the same. This pivotal conflict in the testimony was resolved by the jury in favor of respondents Proctor and Wood Conversion Company. Appellants do not contend that there was any inherent defect in the insulating material or that Balsam Wool was not proper insulation material for a refrigeration plant.\\\\nAppellants first assign as error the trial court\\\\u2019s order striking the second amended complaint as to the Edmonds Lumber Company and its later order dismissing the action as to the partners (respondents Erickson and Lindh).\\\\nEdmonds Lumber Company appeared with a demurrer, and certain motions directed to the amended complaint and, on December 1, 1948, the trial court, after having heard arguments thereon, filed a memorandum decision granting the motions in part and reserving its ruling on the demurrer. A second amended complaint was filed December 10, 1948, and a few days later another demurrer was interposed by the lumber company together with similar motions directed to that complaint.\\\\nOn December 24, 1948, after further hearing, the court entered an order striking\\' the second amended complaint from the files as to the Edmonds Lumber Company for the reason that the second amended complaint contained evidentiary and immaterial matter and was redundant and repetitious and did not conform to the rules and statutes relating to pleading. This order granted appellants leave to file a third amended complaint.\\\\nAppellants failed to file a third amended complaint and did nothing more as to the Edmonds Lumber Company until the case was called for trial in May, 1949. At that time counsel for the partnership moved to dismiss the cause. The court entered an order of dismissal without prejudice as to them. The case then proceeded to trial against the remaining defendants (respondents Proctor and Wood Conversion Company).\\\\nUnder the provisions of Rem. Rev. Stat., \\\\u00a7 286 [P.P.C. \\\\u00a7 86-5], the trial court had discretion to strike the second amended complaint, since it was of the opinion that appellants had not complied with its previous order, and we do not find that there was any abuse of discretion in its so doing. Since appellants, in effect, elected to stand on their second amended complaint and refused to plead further as to the respondents Erickson and Lindh constituting the Edmonds Lumber Company, it was proper for the court to dismiss the action as to them. Appellants invited the entry of the order of dismissal and no error can be predicated upon its entry. Barber v. Grand Summitt Mining Co., 11 Wn. (2d) 114, 118 P. (2d) 773. The order of dismissal entered May 19, 1949, will stand affirmed.\\\\nAppellants next assign as error the failure of the trial court to give certain instructions proposed by them as to express warranty, and in the alternative, as to implied warranty.\\\\nAppellants contend that when respondent Proctor told the appellant and his carpenters that one layer of Balsam Wool on the floor would be enough, he warranted that the product so used would make for a successful locker plant. The sale, therefore, was made under such circumstances that respondent Wood Conversion Company, through its agent Proctor, became a party to the sale to the extent that it either expressly or impliedly warranted that if its product was used in the manner specified by it, the desired object would be accomplished without damage to the building.\\\\nThe general rule is that if there is no contractual privity there can be no warranty, either express or implied. In Mazetti v. Armour & Co., 75 Wash. 622, 135 Pac. 633, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 140, 48 L. R. A. (N.S.) 213, the court noted the general rule above and pointed out certain exceptions to the rule as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201c(1) Where the thing causing the injury is of a noxious or dangerous kind; (2) where the defendant has been guilty of fraud or deceit in passing off the article; (3) where the defendant has been negligent in some respect with reference to the sale or construction of a thing not imminently dangerous.\\\\u201d\\\\nIt is apparent that the instant case does not fit within any of the above exceptions and that therefore it must be governed by the general rule. Respondents were certainly not directly parties to the sale of Balsam Wool to the appellants by the Edmonds Lumber Company. The representations of Proctor, being made after this sale was completed, were not actionable in the absence of a new consideration. Savage v. Markey Machinery Co., 128 Wash. 433, 223 Pac. 2. The use of the Balsam Wool in the circumstances found here does not constitute a new consideration. Thus no liability could be imposed upon respondents in the absence of any negligence in making the statements.\\\\nAppellants cite and place great reliance upon Baxter v. Ford Motor Co., 168 Wash. 456, 12 P. (2d) 409, 15 P. (2d) 1118, 88 A. L. R. 521 (the second appeal being reported in 179 Wash. 123, 35 P. (2d) 1090), as being in support of their position. The decisions in that case have been much discussed in law reviews and in subsequent decisions of this and other courts of last resort. In the Baxter case, a manufacturer was held liable, without regard to privity, to one who had purchased an automobile from a dealer because of breach of representations made by the manufacturer in printed matter furnished by the manufacturer to its dealer, to the effect that the windshield of the automobile was.made of shatter-proof glass. In purchasing the car, the buyer relied on the representations made in these catalogues. \\\\u25a0 It is strenuously argued that, in view of the Baxter case, supra, want of privity is no longer an obstacle in this state to recovery by the ultimate consumer since liability can be imposed upon a manufacturer because of a purchaser\\\\u2019s reliance upon his representations in a catalogue. Consequently, appellant contends that he should recover damages from respondent Wood Conversion Company because of the representations made by respondent Proctor, a representative of the manufacturer who had authority to make them.\\\\nThe Baxter case, supra, is distinguishable from the present case though it does represent an extension of the warranty theory. The purchaser in that case was there induced to buy the product (a Ford car) through certain statements and representations contained in catalogues furnished by the manufacturer to its dealer for distribution to prospective customers. The court stated:\\\\n\\\\u201cIt would be unjust to recognize a rule that would permit manufacturers of goods to create a demand for their products by representing that they possess qualities which they, in fact, do not possess; and then, because there is no privity of contract existing between the consumer and the manufacturer, deny the consumer the right to recover if damages result from the absence of those qualities, when such absence is not readily noticeable.\\\\u201d\\\\nIn the instant case the manufacturer did not induce the sale of a defective product through representations. Indeed, there is no claim that the Balsam Wool was defective in any respect or that this product was represented as possessing qualities which it did not possess. The representations upon which appellant claimed he relied were made through its sales representative after the sale of the Balsam Wool by the Edmonds Lumber Company and were concerned with the proper application of the product. We do not feel that the rule expressed in the Baxter case should be extended to hold that there was a breach of warranty, either express or implied, under the circumstances disclosed in this case.\\\\nWe have examined the other authorities referred to in appellants\\\\u2019 briefs relating to warranty and do not find that they sustain appellants\\\\u2019 claim of error with respect to the court\\\\u2019s refusal to give the instructions proposed by them.\\\\nThe trial court instructed the jury that in order to recover, the appellants must show by a fair preponderance of the evidence that: (1) Appellant purchased Balsam Wool and, in connection with the sale or promotion of sales by the Wood Conversion Company, respondent Proctor, as its agent, made representations as to his skill in the use of Balsam Wool and as to its proper application to appellants\\\\u2019 building; (2) Proctor was under a duty to give correct information if he spoke and that Proctor knew that appellant intended to rely on the statements; (3) appellant relied upon the statements of respondent Proctor relative to his skill and proper way to apply the material; (4) appellant was warranted as a reasonably prudent person in relying on Proctor\\\\u2019s representations; (5) appellant followed Proctor\\\\u2019s advice; (6) respondent Proctor\\\\u2019s statements were untrue and that Proctor, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known that they were untrue or erroneous, or that Proctor did not act as a reasonably prudent man in making the statements; and (7) as a direct and proximate result of the foregoing, appellants were damaged.\\\\nThe basis of appellants\\\\u2019 next assignment of error is that (assuming that the law of warranty is inapplicable) the instructions given by the court compelled appellants to prove fraud in order to recover instead of merely having to prove negligent misrepresentations. This assignment is without merit because the instructions given did cover negligent misrepresentations and were proper instructions in view of the evidence before the court and jury.\\\\n, Appellants further contend that the trial court erred in refusing to give an instruction requested by them as to the liability of the agent, apart from the corporation he represents. While the trial court did not devote a separate instruction to the liability of respondent Proctor as distinguished from that of respondent Wood Conversion Company (his principal), this matter was in substance covered by other instructions. The court instructed that, if the representations of respondent Proctor were not found to be within the ordinary scope of his business as a sales agent, such statements would not be binding upon Wood Conversion Company. Also, a form of verdict was submitted to the jury by which they could have found for appellants against respondents, Proctor and wife, and in favor of respondent, Wood Conversion Company. There was no error in refusing to give the instruction in the form requested.\\\\nAppellants claim that the trial court\\\\u2019s instruction to the jury regarding the measure of damages incorrectly stated the rule applicable to the facts of this case. Since the jury found no liability on the part of respondents, or either of them, the instruction, if erroneous, on which question we express no opinion, was error without prejudice. Hansen v. Coldwell, 192 Wash. 167, 73 P. (2d) 351; Johnston v. Owens, 21 Wn. (2d) 892, 153 P. (2d) 879.\\\\nError is assigned because of the denial of appellants\\\\u2019 motion for a new trial. Besides the contention that the court erred in refusing their proposed instructions on warranty (already discussed above), appellants in support of their motion relied upon two affidavits of appellant to establish misconduct of three members of the jury. One affidavit is to the effect that appellant noticed one of the jurors napping in the course of the trial. The juror in his affidavit denied that he was asleep. Appellants did not voice any objection to the conduct of the jury during the course of the trial. We hold that therefore appellants waived their right to claim a new trial for the misconduct of this juror. Sun Life Assurance Co. v. Cushman, 22 Wn. (2d) 930, 158 P. (2d) 101.\\\\nAppellant\\\\u2019s other affidavit recited that two of the jurors had private information regarding locker plants (of which they said nothing on their voir dire examination) and that after the verdict they stated publicly that they knew of their own knowledge that appellants\\\\u2019 locker plant would have been a failure because there had been a failure of a similar plant in Monroe. One of the jurors referred to denied by affidavit that he knew anything about the Monroe plant failing until after the rendition of the verdict.\\\\nThe trial court in overruling the motion stated that the affidavit of appellant was so much in the nature of hearsay that its weight was nil. It is axiomatic that the granting or denying of a motion for a new trial on the ground of alleged misconduct of the jury is a matter within the discretion of the trial court. Unless it clearly appears upon appeal that the court abused its discretion, the ruling of the trial court on such motion will not be disturbed. Kellerher v. Porter, 29 Wn. (2d) 650, 189 P. (2d) 223. Clearly we cannot say that there was an abuse of discretion by the trial court in this case.\\\\nWe have considered the other assignments of error discussed in appellants\\\\u2019 briefs and find them to be without merit.\\\\nThe jury having found the facts in favor of respondents Proctor and Wood Conversion Company after being fairly charged by the court as to the law applicable to the issues presented, the judgment entered in their favor upon the verdict is hereby affirmed.\\\\nSimpson, C.

Conradi, deceased, and personally, instituted this action against Grant Arnold and Elizabeth Arnold, his wife, asking for judgment for damages on each of two separate causes of action stated in the second amended complaint, hereinafter referred to as the complaint.\\\\nThe first cause of action was brought under the survival statute, Rem. Rev. Stat, \\\\u00a7 194 [P.P.C. \\\\u00a7 3-43], as set forth in the complaint, plaintiff demanding judgment against the defendants for $10,380, on account of pain and suffering sustained by her deceased husband during his lifetime because of the alleged negligence of defendants, together with expenses incurred during the last illness of the deceased.\\\\nBy her second cause of action, plaintiff demanded judgment against defendants for fifteen thousand dollars, on account of the loss of prospective earnings by Mr. Conradi during his reasonable life expectancy, for the benefit of plaintiff and Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s surviving daughter, together with ten thousand dollars by way of damages suffered by plaintiff and Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s daughter, occasioned by the death of Mr. Conradi. Plaintiff also demanded judgment in the further sum of five hundred dollars on account of the expenses of Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s funeral, making a total of $25,-500, based upon her second cause of action.\\\\nIn her complaint, plaintiff alleged that, prior to January 23, 1948, plaintiff and the late William E. Conradi were husband and wife, residing as tenants in a third-floor apartment in a building owned and operated by defendants Arnold; that, on October 7, 1947, at about ten minutes after six o\\\\u2019clock a. m., Mr. Conradi proceededdo leave the apartment and was about to descend the stairway leading therefrom to the second floor; that the entire stairway was under the control of defendants; that, due to the negligence of defendants in maintaining the stairway, it was in a dangerous and unsafe condition; and that Mr. Conradi slipped and fell from the top of the stairway down approximately sixteen steps to the landing beyond the lower step thereof.\\\\nPlaintiff pleaded certain ordinances of the city of Seattle relating to buildings, the construction and lighting thereof, and the maintenance of a healthful temperature therein, and alleged that the stairway was defective in certain named particulars (hereinafter referred to); that, as a result of the fall, Mr. Conradi suffered severe injuries and thereafter endured great pain; that the fall was the proximate cause of Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s death, which occurred January 23, 1948, and that Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s suffering and death proximately resulted from defendants\\\\u2019 negligence.\\\\nPlaintiff also alleged in her complaint that, about the middle of December, 1947, defendants served upon Mr. Conradi and the plaintiff notices terminating their tenancy and requiring them to surrender possession of the apartment January 15, 1948; that she and her husband complied with this notice; and that, in moving, Mr. Conradi lifted many heavy boxes and other articles, to his further injury.\\\\nBy their answer to plaintiff\\\\u2019s complaint, the defendants admitted the existence of the ordinances of the city of Seattle pleaded by plaintiff; that Mr. and Mrs. Conradi were their tenants; that Mr. Conradi fell and was injured; and that he died on the date alleged, but denied the other material allegations of the complaint and particularly that plaintiff had suffered damage as the result of any negligence on the part of the defendants.\\\\nBy way of an affirmative defense, the defendants alleged that any injuries sustained by Mr. Conradi or by the plaintiff were solely caused by and resulted from Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s own contributory negligence.\\\\nBy her reply, plaintiff denied the affirmative allegations contained in defehdants\\\\u2019 answer.\\\\nThe action was tried to the court, sitting without a jury, and, after having personally inspected the premises, the trial judge entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in favor of the defendants, followed by the entry of a judgment in favor of defendants, dismissing plaintiff\\\\u2019s action with prejudice. From this judgment, plaintiff has appealed, making the following assignment of errors:\\\\n\\\\u201c (1) The Superior Court erred in finding that William E. Conradi was fully familiar with the condition of the hallway, including the rug or strip of carpet, the bare floor and the conditions thereof (Finding No. III).\\\\n\\\\u201c (2) The Superior Court erred in finding that William E. Conradi was guilty of contributory negligence (Findings No. IV and V).\\\\n\\\\u201c(3) The Superior Court erred in finding that there is no evidence that any negligent or unlawful act on the part of the respondents was a proximate cause of Conradi\\\\u2019s death (Finding No. VII).\\\\n\\\\u201c (4) The Superior Court erred in making its Conclusion of Law that the respondents were guilty of no negligent or unlawful act which was a proximate cause of the death of Conradi (Conclusion No. I).\\\\n\\\\u201c(5) The Superior Court erred in making its Conclusion of Law that the complaint of appellant should be dismissed with prejudice and that respondents should be allowed judgment against appellant for their costs (Conclusion No. II).\\\\n\\\\u201c(6) The Superior Court erred in entering judgment in favor of respondents and against appellant, dismissing appellant\\\\u2019s complaint and awarding costs against her.\\\\n\\\\u201c(7) The Superior Court erred in overruling appellant\\\\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the oral decision.\\\\n\\\\u201c(8) The Superior Court erred in overruling appellant\\\\u2019s motion for a new trial.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe late William E. Conradi and the appellant herein, Ida Mae Conradi, were for many years husband and wife, and were the parents of Mrs. Thomas Long.\\\\nThe respondents Grant and Elizabeth Arnold are husband and wife, and, as a marital community, owned an apartment building known as No. 5808 Fifteenth avenue northeast, in the city of Seattle. They occupied an apartment in the building and rented the other apartments.\\\\nDuring the month of April, 1947, Mrs. Conradi, on behalf of the community composed of herself and her husband, rented from respondents apartment No. 9, on a month-to-month basis, it being understood that respondents would supply electricity and heat. Mr. and Mrs. Conradi took possession of their apartment, which they occupied until January 15, 1948, when they departed, as will be hereinafter set forth.\\\\nApartment No. 9 was on the third floor of the building and was accessible only by way of a rather steep flight of stairs, consisting of sixteen steps. In this opinion, we shall refer to the left and right sides of the stairway from the standpoint of a person leaving the apartment to descend the stairs. On the left-hand side of the stairway was a vertical wall, and on the right-hand side was a bannister. The flight of stairs ended at the top at the door opening into the apartment. There was no stair landing whatever on the outside of this door. One leaving the apartment to go downstairs would step from the floor in the doorway down the first step of the stairway. The door to the apartment opened inward, to the left of one leaving the apartment. The floor of the apartment was of hardwood, and was bare for a distance of ten or twelve inches on the approach to the door from within the apartment. The floor extended under the door and for a distance of only two or three inches beyond the door toward the stairway. The edge of the floor next to the stairway consisted of a narrow strip of hardwood, and there was testimony to the effect that this portion of the floor was somewhat loose and would tilt a little when a person placed his weight thereon. Respondents\\\\u2019 testimony was to the effect that the strip referred to was not loose.\\\\nThere was also testimony to the effect that the bare portion of the apartment floor was somewhat slippery. Appellant testified that she kept the hardwood floor of the apartment, between the end of the rug or carpet and the door to the apartment, cleaned and polished, and that, on several occasions, she had observed that someone was cleaning or polishing that portion of the floor which projected beyond the door.\\\\nOn the staircase wall, to the right of a person leaving the apartment and at a convenient elevation above the bannister rail, was a short handrail, to be used until the person descending the stairs reached a position where use of the bannister rail was convenient. It appeared that, at the time of Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s accident, this handrail was somewhat loose. However, it may be noted that it does not appear that, on the occasion of the accident, Mr. Conradi took hold of this rail.\\\\nThere was an electric light on the first floor at the foot of the second flight of steps, when descending, but this light could be turned on only by a switch on the ground floor. It also appears that this light was generally not turned on.\\\\nUpon the ceiling of the apartment, just inside the door, was an electric light which was controlled by a push button on the wall of the stairway, outside the door of the apartment. Consequently, anyone desiring to descend from the apartment with the aid of this light would be required to open the door, stand on the top step of the stairway (which, as above stated, was the floor of the apartment), or descend one step, then reach to his right and press the light switch to turn on the light, which, while the door was open, would illuminate at least the upper portion of the stairway.\\\\nThe apartment door did not open on the middle of the stairway (all as shown by a photograph which was introduced in evidence), but somewhat to the right of the center thereof, as a person descended. The center portion of the stairway was covered with a stair carpet, but, as shown by a photograph, this carpet did not coincide exactly with the doorway. The floor carpet or rug in the apartment hall did not extend to the door, but ended at the distance from the door above mentioned.\\\\nThere was a window, apparently covered by a light curtain, on the landing at the foot of the stairs, but this window afforded little, if any, aid in lighting the stairway during hours of dusk. It would seem that the stairway was, at all times, rather dark, unless the light, above referred to, within the apartment, was turned on and the apartment door was open.\\\\nThe photographs of the stairway, door, and so forth, which were offered as exhibits by respondents and received in evidence, were taken during the month of December, 1947.\\\\nMr. Conradi was employed as an engineer on a cannery tender operating in Alaskan waters. He would be at home for a day or so at intervals of about two weeks. On the morning of October 7, 1947, Mr. Conradi arose, and, at a few minutes after six o\\\\u2019clock, standard time, started to leave the apartment. No lights were turned on in the apartment. The light at the foot of the stairway on the first floor was not turned on, and Mr. Conradi, as Mrs. Conradi testified at the trial, opened the apartment door and, while standing on the floor of the apartment, reached for the light switch on the stairway wall to the right of the door for the purpose of turning on the light within the apartment, which would illuminate the stairway. As Mr. Conradi turned, he fell down the staircase. Mrs. Conradi, who saw her husband fall, hurried to the landing at the foot of the stairs, where she found Mr. Conradi lying with his back resting against the lower step. The loose rug on the landing was wrapped around his legs. Mrs. Conradi released her husband from the rug, and, notwithstanding her protests, he insisted upon going to work and departed.\\\\nA witness, Carrie McGranahan (who was not previously acquainted with Mr. Conradi), while waiting on the street for transportation to her place of employment, saw bim fall to his knees after attempting to open a garage door. The witness asked Mr. Conradi if he had suffered a heart attack and offered to assist him. Mr. Conradi told her that he had just fallen down a flight of stairs, but that he did not require help. She saw him enter the garage, apparently still in distress.\\\\nAt about three o\\\\u2019clock in the afternoon, or a little later, Mrs. Conradi, hearing a noise outside the apartment, opened the door and found her husband slowly ascending the stairs. He told her that he had left his work as soon as his assistant had arrived to reheve him. That evening, with the assistance of Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s son-in-law, who carried Mr. Conradi down the stairs to his car, the injured man was taken to a doctor, who, by means of X rays, ascertained that Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s right heel bone had been crushed. A cast was applied, and, about two weeks thereafter, Mr. Conradi was taken to a hospital, where an operation was performed upon his injured foot and another cast was applied, which reached to his hip. He remained in the cast for almost nine weeks thereafter. Mr. Conradi also complained of an injury to his back, and sustained some severe bruises. Although he suffered much pain, Mr. Conradi apparently made substantial progress toward a recovery.\\\\nDecember 15th, respondents served upon each of the Conradis a notice requiring them to vacate the apartment within thirty days. Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s leg was still in a cast, and, in the effort to find another place to live, he became tired, lost weight, and showed signs of physical deterioration.\\\\nThe trial court, over respondents\\\\u2019 objection, permitted appellant to introduce testimony in connection with the notices to quit, which respondents served upon Mr. Con-radi and appellant, and also admitted testimony concerning the physical efforts which Mr. Conradi exerted in moving from the apartment. The same is true as to testimony regarding the degree of heat furnished the apartment by respondents, appellant contending that the heat was insufficient to keep the apartment warm. The court reserved its ruling as to the admissibility of all this testimony, but never finally passed upon this question, as the action was dismissed upon the merits.\\\\nDuring argument upon the admissibility of the testimony, appellant\\\\u2019s counsel referred to certain Federal statutes and regulations concerning the dispossession of tenants, but no such statutes or regulations were pleaded nor were any introduced in evidence.\\\\nIn connection with the notices to terminate tenancy served by respondents, appellant testified that she had consulted her attorney, who advised her to see the local office of price administration authorities. Mrs. Conradi testified that she followed this advice, taking the notices to the OPA office, where, in response to questions, she detailed the circumstances, but was told that \\\\u201cthere was nothing they could do.\\\\u201d It does not appear that either Mr. or Mrs. Conradi took any further legal steps to contest the \\\\u2022termination of tenancy.\\\\nRespondents were requested to permit the Conradis to continue to occupy the apartment until they could find a suitable place to live, but respondents insisted that the apartment be vacated by the evening of January 15, 1948. In order to meet this deadline, the Conradis were required to work hard, packing and moving. Although they engaged movers to carry their possessions from the apartment, Mr. Conradi became extremely fatigued from walking up and down the stairs, and exerted himself to a great degree in unloading goods from their car, some for storage at his daughter\\\\u2019s residence, and other articles at their new place of abode.\\\\nAfter moving (January 15th), Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s physical condition deteriorated, and, January 23rd, while driving his automobile from his- daughter\\\\u2019s home to the Conradi residence, he suffered a heart attack, dying almost immediately.\\\\nAt the time of his death, Mr. Conradi was sixty-two years of age. He was a trained machinist and diesel engineer, and had been employed both at sea and on shore. He had suffered from diabetes since 1939, but apparently this disease had not interfered with his work. It appears that he had also suffered from a heart ailment for some time, but this condition was not known until an autopsy was performed. At his age, Mr. Conradi had a normal life expectancy of something over twelve years.\\\\nAt the close of the testimony, the trial court delivered its oral decision, stating that \\\\u201cevidence in volumes\\\\u201d had been received, over objections, and that the time of argument had not been limited. The decision also states that, at the request of counsel (at the close of appellant\\\\u2019s case), the court had examined the premises, climbing up the stairway to the apartment, and obtaining firsthand knowledge of the situation. The court called attention to the fact that Mr. and Mrs. Conradi had occupied the apartment for six months and were thoroughly acquainted with the staircase and its appurtenances.\\\\nThe court strongly criticized respondents for serving notices upon the Conradis to move from the premises and also for the rather objectionable terms in which the notices were drawn, the phraseology being such as would be humiliating to the Conradis.\\\\nThe court also called attention to the fact that, when the Conradis moved, Mr. Conradi underwent some rather extraordinary physical exertion in connection with the moving, thereby exhausting his energy, but observed that Mr. Con-radi did this as a matter of his own choice.\\\\nIn summing up the situation, the trial court was of the opinion that, in view of Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s thorough knowledge of the stairway, it should be held that his own negligence contributed to his fall, and that respondents were not liable for other matters of which appellant complains. The court then stated that the action would be dismissed.\\\\nAfter finding that appellant was the administratrix of the estate of her late husband, and that respondents were the owners and operators of the apartment house in question, the trial court entered finding No. 2, which reads as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cThat located on the third floor of the apartment building of the defendants is a certain apartment which the plaintiff Ida Mae Conradi and her husband, William E. Conradi, occupied under a month-to-month tenancy from April 18, 1947, to January 15, 1948; that from the second floor of the apartment building a stairway extends 16 steps upward to a door which provides the sole means of ingress and egress to the apartment rented by the plaintiff and her husband; that this stairway was maintained for the sole use of and used solely by the tenants in the said third-floor apartment and their visitors, and constituted a necessary and sole approach to the premises.\\\\u201d\\\\nBy finding No. 3, the court established the facts concerning the floor of the apartment to the outside edge thereof, the operation of the door as above set forth, and that\\\\n\\\\u201c . . . the condition of the floor of the said apartment hallway was exactly the same and had not changed in any way from April 18, 1947, to October 7, 1947; that the said William E. Conradi was fully familiar with the condition of the hallway, including the rug or strip carpet, the bare floor and the condition thereof.\\\\u201d\\\\nFindings Nos. 4 and 5 read as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201c(4) That on the 7th day of October, 1947, at about 6:05 to 6:10 a. m. William E. Conradi, while about to leave the apartment to proceed on his way to work, was standing within the hallway in his apartment, with the door to the stairway open, and at a point near the edge of that part of the hall floor nearest the stairway, when as a result of his own negligence he slipped and fell to the bottom of the stairway, resulting in certain injuries to him; that the hallway, doorway and stairway were then dark and in order to illuminate the same it was necessary for William E. Con-radi to turn to his right to reach the electric switch on the wall and the stairway just outside the doorway leading into the apartment hall; that the said William E. Conradi did so turn and reach for said switch and in so doing he fell to the bottom of the stairway.\\\\n\\\\u201c(5)\\' That the proximate cause of the fall of the said William E. Conradi and the injuries resulting therefrom was his own contributory negligence; that he was negligent in failing to take heed of the bare floor of the hallway on which he slipped, thereby causing his fall.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe court then continued by finding the service by respondents upon Mr. and Mrs. Conradi of the notices to vacate the apartment, and other circumstances in connection with those notices, this finding concluding as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201c. . . that in connection with said move the said William E. Conradi elected to and did lift certain boxes containing household goods and a heavy tool chest.\\\\u201d\\\\nFinding No. 7 reads as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cThat thereafter on January 23, 1948, William E. Con-radi died from acute cardiac failure; that there is no evidence that any negligent or unlawful act on the part of the defendants was a proximate cause of his death, but that a proximate and contributing cause of his death was his fall down the stairs on October 7, 1947.\\\\u201d\\\\nFrom the findings entered, the trial court concluded \\\\u201cThat the defendants were guilty of no negligent or unlawful act which was a proximate cause of the death of William E. Conradi on January 23, 1948,\\\\u201d and that the action should be dismissed with prejudice.\\\\nThe court then signed the judgment dismissing the action, from which this appeal is prosecuted.\\\\nThe autopsy performed after Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s death indicated that for some time he had suffered from a bad heart condition. It nowhere appears that Mr. Conradi had any knowledge of the fact that he was suffering from any such affliction, and there can be no question but that his death was the result of acute cardiac failure. Of course, his fall would tend to render this condition more serious, and undoubtedly his strenuous physical exertions in moving from the apartment to a new location would be injurious, in view of his unfortunate cardiac condition. It is not denied that, during the moving operation, Mr. Conradi worked hard and moved heavy objects, including a tool chest. It does not appear that he could not have obtained any desired assistance in moving, but evidently he voluntarily assumed this burden.\\\\nThe findings of the trial court in an action at law are presumed to be correct and, on appeal, will be approved by this court unless we find that they are against the weight of the evidence. Wade v. Bartek, 30 Wn. (2d) 483, 191 P. (2d) 701; Graham v. Roderick, 32 Wn. (2d) 427, 202 P. (2d) 253; Fountain v. Parnell, 32 Wn. (2d) 599, 202 P. (2d) 918.\\\\nHaving lived in the apartment for several months, Mr. Conradi was, of course, thoroughly familiar with the condition of the floor of the apartment, the door leading therefrom, the stairway to the second floor, and the lights available for illuminating those areas. It does not appear that the fact that the upper handrail was somewhat loose anywise contributed to Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s fall.\\\\nAppellant makes much of the evidence introduced on her behalf to the effect that, after Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s fall, the narrow board at the edge of the apartment floor was somewhat reduced in width and rendered firm in its position, but this would not change the situation with which Mr. Conradi was perfectly familiar prior to his accident. Mr. and Mrs. Conradi accepted the apartment and the means of ingress and egress in connection therewith, and, although they did complain of inadequate heat and electricity, it does not appear that their complaints extended to any floor condition. Appellant testified that she had slipped on the floor and had so advised her husband. Her daughter, Mrs. Long, and the latter\\\\u2019s husband, testified that they had noticed that the floor was slippery. Miss Anna Steendahl, a high school teacher and a friend of the Conradis, called as a witness on appellant\\\\u2019s behalf, testified that the apartment floor was slippery. From the evidence, it appears that appellant cleaned the floor of the apartment up to the door.\\\\nRespondent Grant Arnold testified that there had been no structural changes made in connection with apartment No. 9 since 1925. Respondents Arnold both testified that the portion of the floor of the apartment which projected beyond the door was never polished by them during appellant\\\\u2019s tenancy (as above stated, appellant testified to the contrary), and that the apartment and the stairway remained in exactly the same condition at all times after appellant and her husband took possession.\\\\nAll conditions concerning apartment No. 9 and the staircase leading thereto from the second floor-were open and apparent. It is not contended that respondents made any agreement with Mr. and Mrs. Conradi to alter or repair any portion of the demised premises or that respondents were requested to do so. It nowhere appears that\\' there was any concealment on the part of respondents of the existing conditions. Inconvenient as the exit from the apartment was, the situation was at all times open and apparent, and thoroughly understood by the tenants. Respondents denied that the edge of the floor projecting beyond the door was loose, but, in any event, there is no evidence to the effect that the Conradis ever requested that any change or repair be made.\\\\nThe general rule is stated in 2 Restatement of the Law of Torts 967, \\\\u00a7 356, as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cExcept as stated in \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 357 to 362, a lessor of land is not liable for bodily harm caused to his lessee or others upon the land with the consent of the lessee or a sub-lessee by any dangerous condition whether natural or artificial which existed when the lessee took possession.\\\\u201d\\\\nIn 32 Am. Jur. 515, \\\\u00a7 654, appears the following:\\\\n\\\\u201cA lessee takes the hired premises, in the absence of warranty, fraud, or misrepresentation, in the condition and quality in which they are. The tenant takes the property as he finds it, with all existing defects which he knows or can ascertain by reasonable inspection. He takes the risk of apparent defects. As between himself and his landlord, where there is no fraud or false representation or deceit, and in the absence of an express warranty or covenant to repair, there is no implied contract that the premises are suitable or fit for occupation, or for the particular use intended, or that they are safe for use. Any implied contract relates only to the estate, and not to the condition, of the property. In other words, in the absence of fraud or concealment on the part of the landlord, a rule similar to that of caveat emptor applies and throws upon the lessee the responsibility of examining as to the existence of defects in the premises and of providing against their ill effects.\\\\u201d\\\\nIn 16 R. C. L. 1030, \\\\u00a7 552, the text states that, under the common law, it is well settled that the landlord is under no obligation \\\\u201cin the absence of a covenant to that effect, to repair the demised premises, even where they become defective through decay or deterioration.\\\\u201d At p. 1034, \\\\u00a7 555, it is stated that \\\\u201ca landlord not under contract to repair is not responsible to the tenant for injuries to person or property caused by defects in the rented premises.\\\\u201d See, also, 52 C. J. S. 12, \\\\u00a7 417.\\\\nIn 1 Tiffany Real Property (3rd ed.) 158, \\\\u00a7 104, the rule is stated as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cSince the tenant is bound to inspect beforehand, and is subject to the rule of caveat emptor, and the landlord owes no duty to repair, the latter is, in general, not hable for injuries to the tenant or his property resulting from the construction or condition of the demised premises.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis rule is, of course, subject to certain exceptions in connection with hidden defects or acts of a landlord after the initiation of the tenancy.\\\\nIn the case of Moore v. Weber (1872), 71 Pa. St. 429, in reversing a judgment for the plaintiff, the court held that\\\\n\\\\u201cIn the absence of an express agreement there is no implied obligation on the landlord to repair demised premises, . . . The rule here, as in other cases, is caveat emptor. The lessee\\\\u2019s eyes are his bargain. He is bound to examine the premises he rents, and secure himself by covenants, to repair and rebuild.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis case has been frequently cited and followed by courts of other jurisdictions.\\\\nIn the case of Brown v. Dwight Manufacturing Co., 200 Ala. 376, 76 So. 292, the court quoted from the case of Moore v. Weber, supra, and held that the landlord was under no obligation to keep demised premises in repair, in the absence of an agreement to do so.\\\\nThe case last cited was followed by the court of appeals of Alabama in Lusco v. Jackson, 27 Ala. App. 531, 175 So. 566.\\\\nThe supreme judicial court of Massachusetts, in the case of Pittsley v. Acushnet Saw Mills Co., 299 Mass. 252, 12 N. E. (2d) 823, an action by an administratrix of the estate of a deceased person, who had suffered death as the result of an accident on leased premises, held that the landlord was not liable for damages resulting from an accident caused by a hidden defect in the demised premises, there having been \\\\u201cno express or implied warranty by the defendant that the premises were free from defects, nor did it misrepresent the condition of the premises.\\\\u201d\\\\nIn Breazeale v. Chicago Title & Trust Co., 293 Ill. App. 269, 12 N. E. (2d) 217, the court held that a landlord was not responsible to his tenant for injuries suffered from a fall caused by the tenant\\\\u2019s foot catching in an open seam in the carpet in a leased apartment. In the course of the opinion, the court said:\\\\n\\\\u201cThe general rule is that where the right of possession and enjoyment of leased premises passes to the lessee, in the absence of concealment or fraud by the landlord as to some defect known to him and unknown to the tenant, the tenant assumes all risk of personal injury from defects, and the fact that the lessor covenants to repair does not affect this rule so far as concerns the lessor\\\\u2019s liability for personal injuries to the lessee due to defects, although their existence is attributable to the failure of the lessor to repair.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis court has several times considered questions concerning the liability of a landlord for injuries to a tenant, occasioned by defects in the leased premises.\\\\nIn the early case of Mesher v. Osborne, 75 Wash. 439, 134 Pac. 1092, 48 L. R. A. (N.S.) 917, in an opinion by Ellis, J., many authorities are considered. A judgment entered against the landlord upon the verdict of a jury was affirmed. One paragraph of the opinion reads as follows (p. 446):\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is a general principle that, in the absence of express contract to the contrary, a tenant takes the demised premises as he finds them and there is no implied warranty by the landlord that they are safe or fit for the purpose for which they are hired. The maxim caveat emptor applies.\\\\u201d\\\\nIn Larson v. Eldridge, 153 Wash. 23, 279 Pac. 120, a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, a subtenant of the defendant\\\\u2019s tenant, for damages suffered by the plaintiff because of the breaking of a balcony railing was reversed, the court relying upon the foregoing quotation from the opinion in Mesher v. Osborne, supra, and holding that no obligation rested upon the landlord and that the landlord was not liable for damages resulting from the breaking of the defective railing.\\\\nIn the case of Miller v. Vance Lumber Co., 167 Wash. 348, 9 P. (2d) 351, this court also reversed a judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff tenants, in an action for damages based upon personal injuries suffered by one of the plaintiffs because of faulty plaster on the ceiling of one room of a rented apartment.\\\\nSomewhat similar questions were considered in the case of Peterson v. Betts, 24 Wn. (2d) 376, 165 P. (2d) 95, in which this court, sitting En Banc, after citing many authorities, reversed a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, entered pursuant to the verdict of a jury, in an action by a tenant against his landlord for personal injuries suffered by the tenant upon the demised premises.\\\\nThe cases of Baker v. Moeller, 52 Wash. 605, 101 Pac. 231, Polk v. Spokane Interstate Fair, 73 Wash. 610, 132 Pac. 401, Hogan v. Metropolitan Building Co., 120 Wash. 82, 206 Pac. 959, Viles v. Thunborg, 164 Wash. 190, 2 P. (2d) 666, and Dodak v. Lewis, 187 Wash. 138, 59 P. (2d) 1121, are also in point.\\\\nAppellant relies upon the opinion of this court in the case of Andrews v. McCutcheon, 17 Wn. (2d) 340, 135 P. (2d) 459, in which a judgment in favor of the plaintiff wife, on account of injuries suffered by her as the result of a fall down a flight of stairs in a shoe store in the possession and under the control of the defendant, was affirmed. The jury found that the defendant retained control over the stairway in question and failed to keep it in a reasonably safe condition for use by invitees. The evidence introduced was sufficient to support the jury\\\\u2019s finding of negligence on the part of the defendant in maintaining the staircase. The case is not here in point. .\\\\nUnder the evidence in the case at bar, the staircase from the third floor to the second was appurtenant to the apartment, being exclusively for the use of tenants of the apartment and their guests. The treads of the staircase were carpeted, there was a bannister, and, apparently, the staircase itself was free from dangerous elements. Appellant contends that Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s accident was the result of the situation\\' existing in the apartment and the connection of the apartment floor with the stairway. The center of the first stair tread below the apartment floor was covered by the stair carpet, which, apparently, was in good condition.\\\\nEven though respondents assumed the burden of sweeping and cleaning the flight of stairs, the stairway was, nevertheless, entirely appurtenant to apartment No. 9, and, as above stated, Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s fall was not the result of any condition on the stairway-below the floor of-the apartment.\\\\nIt does not appear that the Conradis ever requested or suggested any change in the operation of the light which illuminated the stairway. It would seem that it would have been a very simple matter to have arranged for the turning on and off of that light from within the apartment, by attaching a switch and cord to the light socket, but, apparently, no such suggestion was ever made.\\\\nAppellant herself cleaned and polished the uncarpeted portion of the floor within the apartment and must also have cleaned the portion of the floor under the door. She testified that respondents cleaned or polished the two-inch strip outside of the door.\\\\nThe entire situation, with all of its inconveniences and dangers, was at all times open and apparent, and Mr. and Mrs. Conradi rented the apartment and used the same for the period stated. If the outer strip of the floor was loose, it does not appear that respondents knew of that fact and it is not contended that their attention was ever called to the situation.\\\\nAppellant could recover judgment against respondents only if they were in some way negligent and Mr. Conradi was not contributively negligent. No negligence on the part of respondents is affirmatively shown by the record before us.\\\\nThe trial court patiently listened to the evidence, admitting practically all of the testimony offered by appellant and reserving its rulings upon the competency and materiality of the portions of the testimony to which respondents objected. The court then, at appellant\\\\u2019s request, made a personal examination of the apartment and, from that examination, acquired knowledge of the situation which we do not have.\\\\nThe trial court then found that Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s injuries resulted from his own contributory negligence, and that no negligent or unlawful act on the part of respondents was a proximate cause of Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s death.\\\\nThe statement of facts closes with the trial court\\\\u2019s oral summation of the evidence and the statement that the case would be dismissed \\\\u201cfor want of proof.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe record does not disclose that appellant submitted any proposed findings, or requested any particular finding which the court refused.\\\\nAppellant pleaded, by title, ordinance No. 72200 (the building ordinance) of the city of Seattle, as amended. Sections 20 (providing a penalty), 604, and 611 of the ordinance were read into the record.\\\\nSection 604 refers to the surface material of stair treads, appellant contending that the ordinance had been violated because the top step of the stairway was \\\\u201cwaxed and greased.\\\\u201d The court made no finding upon this matter. By \\\\u201ctop step,\\\\u201d appellant undoubtedly referred to the floor of the apartment, as the first step of the stairway proper was covered with stair carpet. There is no question but that the floor of the apartment was cleaned and polished by appellant herself.\\\\nSection 605 of the ordinance requires that apartment doors open on landings. No violation of this section of the ordinance was pleaded, and the court made no finding of fact thereon. Respondent Grant Arnold testified that no structural change in the apartment had been made since 1925. The question of whether the ordinance was applicable to the situation was not argued, and the court made no finding of fact in connection therewith.\\\\nSection 611 of the ordinance provides for adequate lighting of stairways, and was read into the record. The trial court found that, at the time Mr. Conradi fell, the staircase was not lighted. Of course, Mr. Conradi fell during his attempt to turn on the light. The light was available,- and, under all the circumstances of this case, the ordinance is inapplicable.\\\\nAppellant also pleaded, by title, city ordinance No. 39104, as amended, which requires the heating of occupied apartments, and so forth. No violation of this ordinance was pleaded in the complaint, and the ordinance is not applicable to the situation disclosed by the record. Appellant testified that the apartment was not comfortably warm and that Mr. Conradi caught a cold, but in view of the evidence in the record, the fact that Mr. Conradi had a cold is not pertinent.\\\\nExamination of the evidence convinces us that Mr. and Mrs. Conradi leased the apartment as it was, and that they occupied it for the period above referred to, with full knowledge of the situation,\\' which, appellant now contends, resulted in liability on the part of respondents for her husband\\\\u2019s death.\\\\nIt must be held, as a matter of law, that the record before us discloses no evidence that Mr. Conradi\\\\u2019s fall was due to any negligent act or omission on the part of respondents, and the judgment appealed from is, accordingly, affirmed.\\\\nJeffers, Steinert, Mallery, and Hill, JJ., concur.\",\"type\":\"majority\",\"author\":\"Beals, J.\"}],\"attorneys\":[\"Peyser, Bailey & Cartano, for appellant.\",\"Rode, Cook & Watkins and Frederick J.

The cause was tried to the court, which found that, pursuant to ordinance and regulations of defendant, plaintiff connected his property to appellant\\\\u2019s sewer; that the sewer installation required and approved by defendant was improper; that the sewer was of insufficient capacity to carry off the sewage and water conducted into it; and that, as the proximate result of defendant\\\\u2019s negligence, plaintiff sustained damage in the amount of two hundred and ten dollars, including the expense of fifty-five dollars incurred in the construction of a manhole subsequent to the flooding of the basement. Judgment was entered accordingly. Defendant appealed.\\\\nIt is the position of appellant that an extraordinary storm condition deposited an unusual amount of water in the vicinity of respondent\\\\u2019s property, thereby overtaxing the sewer system, which was reasonably adequate to care for sewage and water reasonably expected to accumulate under ordinary circumstances; and that the contributory negligence of respondent in failing to properly install a back water trap, or check valve, was the proximate cause of the damage and precludes a recovery by respondent.\\\\nThe facts are as follows:\\\\nRespondent owns a building, which was constructed in 1936, located at the northeast corner of Ninth avenue and Perry street, in the city of Spokane. In 1908, appellant installed the Perry street sewer, which is twenty inches in diameter from Seventh avenue to Ninth avenue. A sewer under Ninth avenue empties into the Perry street sewer, the diameter of which at this point is twenty-four inches.\\\\nIt is the duty, under an ordinance of the city of Spokane, of appellant\\\\u2019s health officer, where there is a public sewer in any street, to compel every owner within one hundred and fifty feet of the sewer to install a sufficient drain pipe, which shall connect his property to the nearest sewer. The health officer is also authorized to issue a permit for a cesspool or septic tank on premises in a sewer district, to drain plumbing fixtures or floors too low to be drained into the public sewer; but all other fixtures or floors on the premises are required to be drained through the sewer. The basement of respondent\\\\u2019s property was too low to properly drain to the sewer.\\\\nRespondent called in July, 1936, at the office of appellant\\\\u2019s sewer inspector and superintendent and requested permission to install a cesspool on his premises at Ninth avenue and Perry street. After inspection of respondent\\\\u2019s property, one of the officers of appellant\\\\u2019s sewer department informed the respondent that he would be required to connect with the Perry street sewer and that he would not be permitted to install a cesspool; that is, the city sewer superintendent and the city sewer inspector knew that respondent\\\\u2019s basement was too low to properly drain to the sewer, yet they required him to make the sewer connection, which they later inspected and approved.\\\\nThe basement drains and fixtures of respondent\\\\u2019s property were, pursuant to the foregoing instructions, connected in July, 1936, to the sewer in Perry street. Neither the superintendent of sewers nor the inspector, who required respondent to use iron pipe instead of clay pipe he contemplated installing, informed respondent that a back water trap was necessary or would be required; nor does the city ordinance require the installation of a back water trap. The sewer connection was installed by a man who had constructed sewers for more than twenty-five years. Doubtless, the installation of the connection was in the usual, customary, and workmanlike manner, as it was approved in all respects by appellant\\\\u2019s sewer inspector.\\\\nSince the construction of the Perry street sewer in 1908, the city\\\\u2019s population has greatly increased and many additional house connections \\\\u2014 eight hundred and ninety-one in 1933 \\\\u2014 have been made to the sewer. Many of the streets sloping toward Perry street have been paved within the past few years, so that the surface waters feed into the catch basins, and the remainder of the surface water that does not run into the catch basins accumulates at the comer of Ninth avenue and Perry street, in front of respondent\\\\u2019s property, where the street levels off and a pocket is formed at that intersection. Whenever it rains and the sewer becomes overloaded in that intersection, and often when it accumulates in the street, respondent\\\\u2019s basement receives some of the water.\\\\nDuring the heavy rains in the early part of June,\\' 1937, respondent complained to one of appellant\\\\u2019s commissioners concerning the flowing of water \\\\u2014 not in great quantities \\\\u2014 into his basement. The commissioner suggested to respondent that he install a \\\\u201cback water trap.\\\\u201d Respondent employed a plumber to install such a trap or check valve inside the basement. Whether the plumber did or did not advise respondent that the trap should be installed outside of the building, is not material. The plumber did advise respondent that a back water trap installed in the basement would protect the plumbing therein. There is some evidence that a back water trap installed outside the basement would not wholly prevent the backing up of sewage and water. It is clear, however, that respondent had no further serious difficulty subsequent to installation of a trap following the damage of which he now complains.\\\\nOn June 18, 1937, during a severe rain storm, respondent\\\\u2019s basement was flooded by reason of the backing up of the water and sewage from the Perry street sewer. Great damage was inflicted to property three miles from respondent\\\\u2019s property, it was testified, by the heavy rains. While there is evidence that the rainfall for the entire month of June was Very heavy, there is evidence from which it is reasonably inferable that the total rainfall for the month of June would not have overtaxed the sewer if it had functioned properly.\\\\nDuring the twenty-four hour period of June 18, 1937, forty-seven hundredths of an inch of rain fell. The weather bureau records disclosed that this rainfall was not unusual or excessive; that it had been exceeded many times during other twenty-four hour periods. On June 17, 1937, the day before the rainfall which it is claimed caused the flooding of respondent\\\\u2019s basement, five hundredths of an inch of rain fell. The testimony of one of the weather bureau officials was that, so far as the rainfall on June 18th and 19th, 1937, was concerned, \\\\u201cwe have had rainfall that was greater than that on numerous occasions in the city of Spokane.\\\\u201d On cross-examination, he testified that the rainfall on those two days was unusually heavy; \\\\u201c. . . it was unusual as compared to the normal.\\\\u201d\\\\nThat is, the rainfall was such as had occasionally occurred in the past and which the city should reasonably have expected to occur again. Under such circumstances, if the sewers are so inadequate that they can not take care of the water, the municipality is not relieved from responsibility because the rainfall was extraordinary.\\\\n\\\\u201cWhatever the rule may be as to ordinary surface water or rainfalls, it is settled that a municipal corporation is not liable for damages caused by an overflow of its sewers occasioned by extraordinary rains or floods. However, although the rain doing the damage be of an extraordinary character, yet if the negligence of the city in failing to keep the sewers open concurred and contributed to the damage, then the city has been held liable. And if drains are so inadequate that they cannot take care of the water in case of an ordinary storm, the municipality is not relieved from responsibility because the rainfall was extraordinary.\\\\u201d 6 McQuillin Mun. Corp., Revised (2d ed.), 1226, \\\\u00a7 2868.\\\\n\\\\u201cIn order to give a stream or body of water the character of an extraordinary flow it is not necessary that it should be the greatest flow within memory, but its character in this respect is to be tested by comparison with the usual volume of floods ordinarily occurring. The mere fact, however, that a rainfall was unusual for the particular season in which it occurs does not relieve the municipality from liability. A municipality, as a general rule, is required to guard against such floods or heavy rains as have occasionally occurred, and which may reasonably be expected to occur again, although their occurrence may be at irregular and wide intervals of time.\\\\u201d 43 C. J. 1137, \\\\u00a7 1895.\\\\nThe respondent was compelled by ordinance to connect his property to the sewer. The sewer connection was made in the manner approved by the appellant city. While the overflow of the sewer was caused by unusual rainfall, the rainfall was such as had occasionally occurred in the past and which the appellant should reasonably have expected to occur again. The appellant failed in its duty to guard against such heavy rainfall as that which overtaxed the Perry street sewer, which, though\\' adequate when constructed, had become of insufficient capacity in 1937 to carry off the water.\\\\nThe case at bar is controlled by Boyer v. Tacoma, 156 Wash. 280, 286 Pac. 659, 70 A. L. R. 1342, in which we held that a city is hable for the flooding of property required to be connected with a sewer which, though sufficient when constructed, had become of insufficient capacity to carry off the sewage conducted into it. We there said:\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is true that in other cases from this court statements have been made by way of argument which indicate that the contrary rule might be followed. See Vittucci Importing Co. v. Seattle, 72 Wash. 192, 130 Pac. 109. But the statements therein contained are not necessary to a decision of the case. The theory of all of the cases which we have examined, which hold the city liable under circumstances such as we have outlined above, seems to be that the property owner is required to connect with the sewer; that he is not permitted to dispose of his sewage in any other way than the one way provided by the city; that he has no power or authority to remove the cause, or to in any way remedy the defect from which his injury arises; that the city alone has the power and the means to remedy the defective sewer or to replace an inadequate sewer, and that no person should be required to suffer an injury caused by an agency over which he has no control and over which the city has absolute control, and that if an injury is inflicted by such an agency he should be properly compensated therefor. We think this is the better rule and is well supported by both reason and authority.\\\\u201d\\\\nWoolworth Co. v. Seattle, 104 Wash. 629, 177 Pac. 664, is cited by appellant in support of its theory that there can be no recovery for damages from flooding where the loss was due to the concurrent negligence of the city in the maintenance of sewers of insufficient capacity to carry off an average rainfall and the contributory negligence of the owner in failing to keep clean and in proper repair a back water valve required by ordinance in all cellar and basement drains.\\\\nIn the case cited, a city ordinance required the installation of back water valves; while, in the case at bar, there was an absence of such requirement. There is no ordinance, nor is there any regulation of any department, of appellant which required the respondent to install a back water trap to protect his basement. The sewer connection was approved by appellant in all respects. The back water trap was voluntarily installed by respondent inside of his building to protect the plumbing in the basement upon the suggestion of one of appellant\\\\u2019s commissioners when respondent complained of water coming into his basement. In spite of that precaution, he sustained damages; and even if he had installed a back water trap outside of his building, it is not improbable, under the circumstances, that he would have sustained damages.\\\\nError is next assigned on the allowance of the cost of fifty-five dollars for the installation of a back water trap. If appellant had required respondent to install, as it now insists he should have done, the back water trap at the time of the connection of his property to the sewer, that installation would have entailed very little expense. As appellant did not require that installation, which appellant insists would have prevented the dam\\\\u00e1ge, respondent should not be compelled to pay that which he would not have been required to expend if it had not been for appellant\\\\u2019s failure to perform its duty in the first place. Respondent acted in good faith and endeavored to comply with all the requirements exacted by appellant. The court correctly awarded to him the amount he expended in the installation of the back water trap.\\\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\\\nSteinert, C.

Hardman Estate et al., Respondents.\"],\"opinions\":[{\"text\":\"Morris, J.\\\\nAppeal from an order of nonsuit and dismissal, in an action brought by a tenant to recover damages for injuries to her goods, caused by leakage of water from an upper story. The facts, so far as they are pertinent to our inquiry, are about these: The Hardman Estate is the owner of a building on Yesler Way, in Seattle, the lower portion of which is divided into storerooms, and the upper is used as a hotel. Appellant, who was engaged in the millinery business, occupied one of the storerooms under a written lease. Some time in August, 1911, the lessee of the hotel portion, although his lease had not expired, vacated the upper stories, and they continued vacant until after the damage complained of. This lessee not having paid his water rent, the city turned off the water from the hotel portion of the building some time in September. This water service so turned off, it appears, did not affect the storeroom occupied by appellant. There was, however, a dwelling on the rear of the lot which was supplied with the same service pipe as the hotel, and which had been vacated for some time. This vacant dwelling in the rear was rented on November 15, and orders given the city to turn on the water, which was done on November 16. Soon after the water was turned on, it began to o flow through the ceiling and into the room occupied by appellant, causing the damage complained of. An examination of the premises disclosed the fact that, in one of the rooms over the storeroom occupied by appellant, a washstand had been torn from the wall and the water pipes broken,\\' making quite a hole through which the water was escaping. It was also discovered that a large rear window opening on the alley had been broken, making an opening large enough for a person to enter the building. It was also shown that, on three other occasions during the vacancy of the hotel portion, the windows on the alley had been broken, supposedly by boys getting into the building. The lease contained the following clause:\\\\n\\\\u201cThat the said lessee shall hold harmless the said lessor and the said lessor\\\\u2019s agents- from all damages of every kind or nature whatsoever that may occur by reason of any accident on said premises, -and from any damage done or occasioned by or from plumbing, gas, water, steam, or other pipes or sewerage ; or the bursting, leaking or running of any cistern, tank, wash-stand, or waste-pipe in, .above, upon or about said building or premises; and from any damage occasioned by water, snow, or ice being upon or coming through the roof, skylight, wall, trapdoor, or otherwise, and from damages arising from acts of neglect of co-tenants or other occupants of the same building, or of any owners or occupants of the adjacent or contiguous property.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis stipulation, in the judgment of the lower court, exempted the respondents from any responsibility in the matter, and was the basis of the ruling complained of. Stipulations of this character cannot be enlarged upon to include any damage not expressly waived, and it is generally held that such a stipulation will not excuse an injury occasioned by the negligence of the landlord in the management and use of any part of the premises remaining under his control. Levin v. Habicht, 45 Misc. 381, 90 N. Y. Supp. 349; 1 Thompson, Negligence, \\\\u00a7 1143. It has also been held that such stipulations cover only ordinary wear and tear, or sudden action of the elements which could not be guarded against, or negligent acts of other tenants. Randolph v. Feist, 23 Misc. 650, 52 N. Y. Supp. 109; Worthington v. Parker, 11 Daly (N. Y.) 545.\\\\nIt is clear from the facts that the damage to appellant was not caused by any breaking of water pipes on the premises leased to her, nor was it due to any negligence of cotenants, nor of owners or occupants of adjacent property, but was due to the bursting or breaking of water pipes on premises not covered by the lease but within the building, and fall within that clause of the waiver exempting damage occasioned by bursting or leaking of washstands in, above, upon, or about the building, or by water coming through the walls. We think it is also clear that the cause of the damage was not an ordinary leak due to defective plumbing or usual wear, such as might be anticipated in any building and thus be within the contemplation of the parties when entering into a stipulation of this character, but was an unusual and unexpected happening, due to other than natural and anticipated defects or lack of repair in any fixture forming part of the water system of the building.\\\\nThere was no evidence that the proximate cause of this damage was any act of the landlord; and if appellant\\\\u2019s cause must rest upon some positive act of the landlord, it must fail. Negligence, however, may be predicated upon the failure to act where the law imposes a duty; and as between the appellant and the landlord, the occupancy and possession of the upper stories, with all the duties .flowing from such a relation, were with the landlord. The landlord could not excuse itself from this duty to appellant because of -the fact that, as between it and the lessee of the upper stories, the possession and occupancy was that of the latter. And this, we think, is so notwithstanding the tenant of the upper story had vacated within the term covered by the lease and the legal right of possession still remained in him. This might be and doubtless was true, as between the landlord and the upper tenant; and as between them, the upper tenant was still bound under his lease. But, whatever may have been the legal fiction, the facts were the upper tenant had vacated the premises and thus occasioned an actual, if not a legal, vacancy. Possession and control must rest somewhere, and as between the landlord and appellant, who was no party to the lease held by the upper tenant and not bound by any contract between this tenant and the landlord, this possession and control was, we think, with the landlord. It, therefore, seems to us, conceding the rule to be that the landlord is under no legal obligation to repair the demised premises, that it was the duty of the landlord to so control and preserve the upper stories as to keep them in a condition of reasonable safety, in so far as such a condition affected the tenant of the lower story; that, if it negligently suffered the upper story to be out of repair to such an extent as to damage the tenant of the lower story, it must respond in damages, and that the ordinary rule we have just referred to does not cover such condition as the facts here present. Priest v. Nichols, 116 Mass. 401.\\\\nSo far as we can gather from the facts, the injury was .caused by evilly disposed persons breaking into the building through the windows in the alley and outside of the premises covered by the lease to appellant. But the duty to guard the premises, so that such persons could not break into the building and injure the fixtures in the upper story, rested with the landlord and not with the appellant; and as it also appeared that these rear windows had been broken on three previous occasions, thus affording entrance to the upper stories, the landlord is chargeable with knowledge of the fact, and having knowledge it was its duty to guard against any recurrence and the natural consequences of such a trespass, by either protecting the premises from such a breaking, or investigating as to any harm that might have been occasioned thereby. The landlord also knew that the hotel section and the house in the rear were connected with the same water service pipe, and before the water was turned on, should have made an investigation of the upper floors to ascertain whether or not such an act could be done with safety to the premises occupied by appellant. Such failure to properly exercise superintendence over the upper story might, it seems to us, within the facts of this case, be\\\\u2019held negligence. Rosenfield v. Newman, 59 Minn. 156, 60 N. W. 1085. At least, we are not so clear it was not negligence as to say the question should not have been submitted to the jury. This disposes of the dismissal as to The Hardman Estate.\\\\nJohn Davis & Company was only the rental agent of the owner. Appellant, having dealt with a known owner and having sought to enforce her cause of action against the principal, cannot hold the agent, and. as to this respondent the dismissal is sustained.\\\\nThe judgment is affirmed as to John Davis & Company, and reversed as to The Hardman Estate.\\\\nCrow, C.

Wood, Appellant, v. The City of Tacoma, Respondent.\"],\"opinions\":[{\"text\":\"Ellis, J.\\\\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of non-suit and dismissal of an action to recover damages consequent upon the grading of, and construction of storm sewers in, certain streets in the city of Tacoma.\\\\nAbout three years before any of the streets in the vicinity of her property had been graded, the appellant bought lots 5 to 10, inclusive, in block 4, of Elsmere addition to Tacoma. Block 4 fronts to the south on 60th street, and is bounded on the east by J street, on the west by K street, and on the north by the alley between blocks 3 and 4. We reproduce a plat from respondent\\\\u2019s brief the correctness of which seems not to be questioned, merely for the purpose of illustration and to show the location of streets in relation to the appellant\\\\u2019s lots. See nest page.\\\\nElsmere addition is in an outlying part of the city. Some houses had been built there and in that neighborhood, apparently before any of the streets were graded or any drainage provided. The general slope of the land iif that vicinity is from the south and east to the north and west. Appellant\\\\u2019s lots occupy low ground, across which originally the natural drainage of the country to the south and east for a considerable distance flowed. Originally this surface water ran off of appellant\\\\u2019s lots and across block 3 to the northwest. At the time when the city began the grading here in question, improvements and filling by the owners of block 3 had obstructed the natural course of the water, so that it ran in a small ditch \\\\u2014 it does not appear by whom dug\\\\u2014 along the alley to K street, and thence north. There was also a ditch on the southerly side of 60th street which carried a part of the surface water to K street. This was apparently dug after the appellant had purchased and built on her lots; and, also, after that time, the city dug a ditch northward along K street to carry all this surface water to a large drain on 58th street. It appears that these ditches, and also other ditches and drains on this sloping territory, the location and character of which are not made clear by\\\\nthe evidence, had been made, some of them by the city, and others by the owners of different properties. It seems to be admitted that no permanent system of drainage had been constructed or adopted by the city in this territory when appellant purchased her lots and built her house, nor up to the time of the grading complained of in this action. Up to that time, the drainage, such as it was, was merely temporary in character and construction and adapted to the natural surface of the ground.\\\\nIn the fall of 1909, the city, by contract, began the grading of the streets and alleys in the vicinity of appellant\\\\u2019s property. The work apparently included all of these streets, excepting south 60th street. This grading was the initial improvement of these streets, the first change from the natural contour of the ground. Just before the heavy rains of November, the grading of K street had been completed; and between 60th and 59th streets, it had been necessary to raise the level of the street and sidewalks a little above the natural surface. At the same time, and as a part of the same work, the alley between blocks 3 and 4 was correspondingly raised. There was, therefore, a fill, variously estimated at from a foot to two feet, in the alley in the rear of appellant\\\\u2019s lots. This grading of the street and alley filled the ditch\\'in the alley and stopped up the K street end of the ditch on 60th street. At the same time, the city was constructing a storm sewer, from 64th street north along J street to 60th street, and along 60th to K street. \\' The heavy rains stopped the work before it reached K street. It does not appear that this sewer was fully completed from 64th street down to 60th street, but it does appear that the pipes were laid at 60th and J street, and that there was a manhole at 61st street and another at 60th street.\\\\nIn the grading of 61st street, there was a slight cut between K and- J streets, and the surplus dirt-was used in filling the lots in the vacant block 6, abutting on the north side of 61st street. This whole block was filled to about 18 inches above the street. When the heavy rains of November came, the water, following its usual course from the higher ground from the south and east, being arrested by this filling of block 6, collected in 61st street and vicinity forming a pond. A part of the filling on the lots near J street washed away, and some of the water which had collected in 61st street flowed into the unfinished storm sewer, and out again through the manhole at 60th and J street, thence down 60th street onto appellant\\\\u2019s lots, and was there retained by the filled grade of K street and of the alley in the rear of her lots, causing the injury complained of.\\\\nIt is fairly deducible from the whole of the evidence that little if-any\\'more water was thus collected upon appellant\\\\u2019s lots than would have been the case had no water been allowed to collect in 61st street and had no storm sewer been constructed in J street. The water which came from 61st street would simply have collected in the first instance in 60th street and upon the appellant\\\\u2019s lots. It was merely delayed in its progress by the filling in of block 6, and reached appellant\\\\u2019s lots possibly a little later than otherwise by going around the block instead of crossing it diagonally. But even if there was an increase in the amount of water, it has been held not to create a liability unless the water be cast in a concentrated and destructive body upon the land. Davis v. Crawfordsville, 119 Ind. 1, 21 N. E. 449, 12 Am. St. 361; Jordan v. Benwood, 42 West Va. 312, 26 S. E. 266, 57 Am. St. 859, 36 L. R. A. 519; Hume v. Des Moines, 146 Iowa 624, 29 L. R. A. (N. S.) 126; Miller v. Morristown, 47 N. J. Eq. 62, 20 Atl. 61.\\\\nThe real cause of the water collecting upon appellant\\\\u2019s lots was the raising of the grade of K street and the alley back of these lots, which stopped the drains in 60th street and the alley, thus impounding the water. The evidence fairly indicates that, but for this grading, the water would have passed off as formerly. The appellant herself makes this plain. With reference to the old drains in the alley in 60th street and K street, she testified:\\\\n\\\\u201cQ. This is 60th street, as I understand you; what do you call this (referring to Identification A). There was a drain which you say the city made some time down there, and opened it down there in 60th street? A. Yes. Q. Was the ditch in K street at that time the same kind of a drain? A. No, it was a box. Q. Was it open on K, on this side? A. No they covered it up. Q. How far does it run? A. Run down as I understood down to 58th; they had a big ditch down 58th. Q. If it was not for putting that drain in there by somebody by Mr. Wright or somebody, all of this water would have come across your place? A. Yes. Q. So far as that is concerned, that relieved you some? A. Yes, after they graded the street last winter, they put the dirt in here (indicating on Exhibit). Q. That is what you complain of? A. Yes, I complain of them stopping the ditches and the natural drain. Q. Is it not a fact that the natural drain went down across the lots further? A. No, it went through the alley, not through Hadland\\\\u2019s lots at all.\\\\u201d\\\\nIt is now established law in this state that damages cannot be recovered for consequential injuries to private property occasioned by the original grading of streets and alleys. The dedication of streets and alleys to the public use implies an agreement of the dedicator and his successors in interest that the city may establish grades and improve the streets and alleys thereto in aid of such use. Ettor v. Tacoma, 57 Wash. 50, 106 Pac. 478, 107 Pac. 1061; Fletcher v. Seattle, 43 Wash. 627, 86 Pac. 1046, 88 Pac. 843; Laws 1909, p. 151, \\\\u00a7 1 (Rem. & Bal. Code, \\\\u00a7 7815) ; 4 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (5th ed.), \\\\u00a7 1684.\\\\nIt is also the settled doctrine in this state that surface water caused by the falling of rain or the melting of snow, is to be regarded as an outlaw or common enemy against which every proprietor of land may defend himself, even if in consequence of such defense injury result to others. As to surface waters, this court has definitely adopted the rule of the common law, as - distinguished from the contrary rule of the civil law. Cass v. Dicks, 14 Wash. 75, 44 Pac. 113, 53 Am. St. 859; Harvey v. Northern Pac. R. Co., 63 Wash. 669, 116 Pac. 464; Gould, Waters (3d ed.), \\\\u00a7 265; 30 Am. & Eng. Ency. Law (2d ed.), p. 330.\\\\n\\' Erom the adoption by this court without qualification or restriction of these two doctrines, namely, that a municipal corporation is not liable for injuries consequent upon the initial grading and improvement of its streets, and that surface water is a common enemy against which any one may defend himself, arises the corollary that a city is not liable in damages for injuries to private property by the collection of surface water thereon, caused by the initial grading or improvement of its streets and alleys. Injuries resulting from the reasonable exercise of a legal power are consequential, and cannot be made the basis of recovery. Such is the rule in all those jurisdictions which have adopted without modification the common-enemy doctrine of the common law.\\\\n\\\\u201cIn the jurisdictions which adopt the common law rule, it is held that the rule applies fully to municipal or quasi-municipal corporations as to individuals, and that such a corporation does not incur any liability if in the improvement of its streets or highways it prevents the flow of surface water from adjacent lots; and the same has been held true with regard to the improvement of city lots owned by a municipality. On the other hand, it has been held that a landowner may, by erections or obstructions on his own lands, prevent the flowage of surface waters from a highway upon his land.\\\\u201d 30 Am. & Eng. Ency. Law (2d ed.), pp. 331-332.\\\\nSee, also, 4 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (5th ed), \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 1732, 1733; Elliott, Roads & Streets (3d ed.), \\\\u00a7 556; Gould, Waters (3d ed.), \\\\u00a7 269.\\\\nThere is an exception to this rule of nonliability, which, though not indorsed by some of the courts, and which we do not find has often been applied to the initial grading of streets, we nevertheless believe to be sound in any case. A\\' city may not gather np surface water and discharge it upon land in a concentrated volume to the injury of the land without liability, whether the water be such as naturally would have flowed onto the land or not. The reason is that when collected and discharged in considerable volume upon the land at a given point it may erode and wash channels in the land thus becoming very destructive and injurious. Johnson v. White, 26 R. I. 207, 58 Atl. 658, 65 L. R. A. 250, and note to p. 262. The appellant contends that the evidence bi\\\\u2019ings this case within the exception. But we think not. It fails to show that the water was discharged upon the appellant\\\\u2019s lots in a concentrated volume. It escaped from the manhole in the street, and flowed upon the appellant\\\\u2019s land in a diffused form, as it would have done in any event. In such a case, the mere fact that the water was concentrated in its course to appellant\\\\u2019s land does not create a liability which would not otherwise exist. Clay v. St. Albans, 43 West Va. 539, 27 S. E. 368, 64 Am. St. 883.\\\\nThere remains to be considered the question of negligence. It must be conceded that a municipal corporation, like an individual, is liable for injuries resulting from the negligent exercise of legitimate powers. There is no evidence whatever that, on the completion of the storm sewer on J and 60th street and the new drain on K street, they did not furnish adequate drainage for this district, including appellant\\\\u2019s property; nor was there any evidence that, if the improvement had been completed before the rainy season, any injury would have occurred. The evidence does not make a case of improper or negligent final construction, but merely shows a failure to provide adequate temporary drainage during the progress of the work and the delay made necessary by the rainy season. There is no negligence where there is no violation of duty. There was no absolute duty on the part of the city to furnish temporary drainage for appellant\\\\u2019s lots pending the grading and placing of drains in K street and the construction of the storm sewer on J and 60th streets; nor was it bound to do this if it would entail expense or cause any considerable interference with the prosecution of the work of grading the streets after it had been undertaken, or if it was incompatible with the plan of improvement adopted by the city. Nor was the city bound to do this at all, if the appellant had sufficient notice of the contemplated improvement of the streets, and the manner in which the work was to be done, to have enabled her to protect her lots by providing drainage herself, or by filling the lots, as the evidence shows she has since done. The fact that the old temporary ditches had been dug in the ungraded alley and in the ungraded 60th street, either by the city or with its permission, can make no difference. The city did not thereby abdicate its right to establish an initial grade for its streets and fill them to that grade even if in so doing it filled these ditches. Any other view would make the city liable to some one for some inconvenience every time it sought to grade a street for the first time, and thus render the statute nugatory. The rule in such a case which appeals to us as reasonable, and especially as in. consonance with our statute which does not permit recovery for damages for injuries resulting from the reasonable exercise of the power to grade streets for the first time (Rem. & Bal. Code, \\\\u00a7 7815) is declared by the supreme court of Iowa, in a case cited by appellant, as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cThe true rule here, as we understand it, is that, as the city had power to grade and gutter its streets, it is not liable for defective plans, for in adopting them it acts in a judicial capacity. But it is liable if it negligently carries out such plans, or if, without the adoption of any plans, it proceeds in a negligent manner to make embankments or fills, to the injury of an abutting or adjoining proprietor. As applied to the facts of the case, the city was not liable because of its establishment of grades for West Walnut and West Sixteenth streets, because its act in so doing was either legislative or judicial in character; but in bringing the streets to these grades established, it was bound to the exercise of ordinary care and prudence, and if it unnecessarily or negligently filled ditches and drains in West Sixteenth street, and thus cast surface water back upon plaintiff\\\\u2019s lots, without notice to her, and without her knowledge, and without giving her a reasonable time to bring her lots to grade, the city is liable, not because of defective plans, but by reason of negligence in doing a purely ministerial act; that is, of bringing the streets to the established grade, and, in so doing, filling the ditches and drains for the escape of surface water without providing an escape, either temporary or permanent, for the surface water. Moreover, there was evidence tending to show that it so filled the streets as to collect surface water and discharge it upon plaintiff\\\\u2019s lot. As plaintiff had the right to fill her lot by bringing it to the established grade, doubtless defendant was not obliged to provide permanent culverts, drains, or bridges, although that point we do not now decide. If, after her property is brought to grade, such culverts, ditches, or drains should be constructed, a question may then arise as to defendant\\\\u2019s duty in the premises.\\\\u201d Hume v. Des Moines, supra, 29 L. R. A. (N. S.) 127-136.\\\\nThe evidence shows that the appellant had notice of the city\\\\u2019s intention before the old ditches were filled. She says she protested to the city officials, and in fact that she brought suit against the city in an attempt to stop the grading of K street. She made no attempt to protect her lots, either by filling, diking, or by opening.the old drains, which the city would doubtless have permitted after the drain in K street was completed. This was before the rains set in. The evidence sufficiently shows that this would have been permitted, since the city, in about two days after the first accumulation of water, as appellant admits, \\\\u201cdrained it out the best they could,\\\\u201d by digging a ditch in the alley; and in the spring she says, \\\\u201cThey drained it all out and finally put in a box.\\\\u201d The testimony of both the appellant and her husband shows that, neither before the fall rains nor after, did they, themselves do anything whatever, either to protect the property from water or to drain it off after it accumulated. Surface water being a common enemy, they had the same right to protect their property from it as the city had to protect its streets. 4 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (6th ed.), \\\\u00a7 1733.\\\\n\\\\u201cIt is clear that there is no liability on the part of a municipal corporation for not exercising the discretionary or legislative powers it may possess to improve streets, and, as part of such improvement, to construct gutters or provide other means of draining for surface-waters, so as to prevent them from flowing upon the adjoining lots. And even when the work of grading the streets has been entered upon, there is not ordinarily, if ever, any liability to the adjoining owner arising merely from the non-action of the corporation in not providing means for keeping surface-waters from property situate below the established grade of the street. There are, indeed, cases which go further, and assert that there is no such liability where, in making improvements upon streets or elsewhere, authorized by law, surface-waters are purposely turned from one\\\\u2019s own land to that of another,\\\\u2014 from the street directly upon the adjacent property owner.\\\\u201d 4 Dillon, Municipal Corporations (6th ed.), \\\\u00a7 1734.\\\\nIt would be worse than useless to attempt to harmonize the wilderness of decisions from other states on the questions here involved. Some of them follow the common law rule, others the opposite rule of the civil law, and still others a modified form of the one or the other. So far as we are able to discover by a careful reading of the authorities cited by the appellant, they nearly all arose upon a change of an established grade and not upon an initial grading of the street. In none of them was there a statute involved such as we have here. Manifestly they would not apply under the provisions of our statute which expressly limits recovery to injury by changes of grade. Moreover, they differ widely in their facts from the case before us. In view of the \\'statute as construed in Ettor v. Tacoma, supra, and the rule as to surface water as announced in Cass v. Dicks, supra, we are compelled to hold that the evidence here fails to make a prima ;facie case against the city. The judgment is affirmed.\\\\nDunbar, C.

The facts as we find them are taken from the pleadings, the attached exhibits and opening statement. The defendants entered into an agreement with the plaintiff to erect a building in the city of Seattle, in accordance with certain plans and specifications which had theretofore been agreed upon. The building was to be held under a lease with stipulated rent reserved for a period of seven years. The agreement and lease was made in one writing, and provided that plaintiff should take possession of the building upon its completion, and that he would thereafter \\\\u201cand during the continuance of this lease keep said building including the roof and all sewer connections in good and substantial repair and condition,\\\\u201d and also \\\\u201cthat if at any time repairs to said building may be necessary or required and the party of the second part [plaintiff] shall have neglected or refused to make the same, the parties of the first part [the defendants] may order such repairs made at the cost and expense of the party of the second part, and the party of the second part will upon demand pay to the said parties of the first part and to their order such cost or expense.\\\\u201d\\\\nPlaintiff was notified on the 11th day of January, 1910, that the building was completed and ready for occupancy. The building at that time was apparently completed, but when it rained it was found to be in a leaky condition. Plaintiff then demurred, and we take it from the statement that he refused to take the building. Thereafter defendant served another notice calling upon him to take the property, and plaintiff again protested. Finally it was agreed that defendants would get the building in proper shape. Plaintiff relied upon this assurance and accordingly, on the 14th day of February, moved into the building. Plaintiff also alleges and offers to prove that when he discovered that the roof was still defective and would not turn water, defendants promised to fix it, and from time to time thereafter made such promises and on one or two occasions rebated rent on account of the damage occasioned by the rains. He also offered to prove that the building was at all times when it rained uninhabitable; that his tenancy was only continued because of the promises of defendants to remedy the defects. Relying upon such promises, he kept possession until December 8, 1910, when he was forced to abandon the building.\\\\nThe trial judge did not discuss the motion for judgment, and from the arguments made here we assume that his ruling was based upon that clause of the lease which binds the plaintiff to keep the premises in repair. The court evidently believed that plaintiff had taken possession and had therefore waived his right to insist that the building be completed according to the plans and specifications before he moved in. Before defendants can invoke that clause of the contract for their protection, they must show a performance on their part. They must show that they have built and tendered a habitable structure for the use of the plaintiff; if they tendered a building which, because of defective construction, fails to meet the obligations that they had assumed, they cannot shift the burden of the loss by saying that plaintiff should not have relied upon their promise to perform, or their implied guaranty that the building was habitable at the time they notified plaintiff that it was ready for occupancy. Defendants\\\\u2019 contract was to build; plaintiff\\\\u2019s, to repair. The defect here alleged is one of original construction, not one arising from waste, damage or the ravages of time. This principle was recognized by this court in Hardman Estate v. McNair, 61 Wash. 74, 111 Pac. 1059, where we held that one leasing a room for a particular use was bound to put it in fit condition. The only difference between that case and this is that there the lessee refused to take possession when notified; while here, plaintiff was persuaded to take possession upon a promise to make the building habitable; that is, to perform the contract. It was not a new contract. It was simply a reaffirmation and assurance that the one which already existed would be performed.\\\\nDefendants seek to distinguish the Hardman Estate case by saying that there the lease expressly specified the use to which the premises were to be put, and that we held that this amounted to a warranty that the room would be fit for the uses intended. The case will bear no such distinction. When an owner agrees to erect a building to be rented for a graduated rental ranging from $400 to $600 per month, the law will imply a warranty to put a roof on it. The specifications are not before us, but it is safe to assume that they provide for a roof that will shelter the building, and if so the cases are the same.\\\\nSeveral cases are cited by defendants, but they go to the defense of waiver. Whether plaintiff waived his right to insist upon a full performance of the contract is to be decided upon the evidence. It cannot be decided upon the pleadings and opening statement.\\\\nThe judgment is reversed, with directions to the lower court to let the trial- proceed.\\\\nCrow, C.

Defendant denied the agreement. The case was tried to the court and a jury. A verdict was returned in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant appeals from the judgment entered upon the verdict.\\\\nIt appears that, in the year 1905, the defendant leased lot 2, block 10, Boren & Denny\\\\u2019s addition to Seattle, from the Cyrus F. Clapp estate, for the period of five years. Defendant thereupon erected a one-story brick building upon this lot. This building consisted of several store rooms facing upon Madison street in said city. When the building was about completed, plaintiffs entered into negotiations with the defendant to lease two of these store rooms, numbered 215 and 217 Madison street. The rental and terms of the lease were agreed upon in November, 1905, and upon the 1st of December, 1905, the plaintiffs took possession of the rooms. On the 9th day of December a written lease was entered into, as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cThis indenture of lease made this 9th day of December, 1905, by and between R. J. Ferguson of the city of Seattle, county of King, state of Washington, party of the first part (hereinafter called the lessor) and A. P. Hockersmith, of said city, county and state, party of the second part, (hereinafter called the lessee),\\\\n\\\\u201cWitnesseth: That the said lessor does by these presents lease and demise unto the lessee that certain store room, designated and known as Nos. \\\\u00a315 and \\\\u00a317 Madison street, situated upon lots \\\\u00a3, in Boren & Denny\\\\u2019s addition to the city of Seattle, for a period of two years from the first day of January, 1906, to the 31st day of December, 1907, for the rent or sum of thirty-six hundred dollars ($3,600) payable in gold coin of the United States of America in twenty-four (\\\\u00a34) equal monthly installments amounting to one hundred and fifty dollars ($150) payable in advance on the first day of each and every month during the term of this lease. That said lessee hereby accepts said premises for the term of two years and agrees to pay therefor the sum of thirty-six hundred dollars ($3,600) said sum to be paid at the office of John Davis & Co., No. 709 Second avenue, Seattle, Washington, in the manner and at the times hereinafter specified. That said lessee agrees to pay any and all charges for heat, light and water rates, which shall become due or shall be taxed or assessed against said premises during the term of this lease, and further agrees to make all necessary repairs of whatsoever nature to the interior of said premises, and to deliver up said premises at the expiration of this lease in as good condition as they are now in, excepting the necessary wear and tear thereof and damages by the elements or fire. That said lessee, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns shall hold harmless said lessor\\' from all damages or accidents of every kind or nature whatsoever that may occur on said premises. That said lessee shall not use said premises for saloon or restaurant purposes, nor let or sub-let the whole or any part thereof, nor make or permit to be made any changes \\\\u2022 or alterations whatsoever without the written consent of the said lessor, or John Davis & Co., his agents, nor assign this lease or any part thereof without said written consent. That said lessee shall not use said premises for immoral or illegal purposes, nor under any circumstances permit gambling or the sale of intoxicating liquors upon said premises. It is hereby agreed that if any rent shall be due and unpaid, or if default shall be made in any of the covenants or agreements herein contained, it shall be lawful for the said lessor or John Davis & Co., his agents, to reenter said premises and remove all persons therefrom. That the said lessor, or his agents, shall have the right to enter said premises at all reasonable times, and shall have the further right to place Tor Rent\\\\u2019 signs on said premises thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of this lease.\\\\n\\\\u201cIn witness whereof the parties hereunto have set their hands and seals the day and year first above written.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe lease was signed, sealed, and acknowledged. After the plaintiffs had occupied the building about three months, the defendant sold and conveyed all of his interest in the property to the Cyrus F. Clapp estate, the owner of the fee, and thereafter, on April 2, 1906, the Cyrus F. Clapp estate sold and conveyed the property to Sullivan & Considine. The plaintiffs thereafter, on April 9, with notice of the sale, recorded the lease in the county auditor\\\\u2019s office. Thereafter, in October or November of the same year, the city of Seattle, by its contractors, entered upon the street in front of the property, tore up its sidewalks, and cut away the street some eighteen feet, leaving for several months no means of ingress to or egress from the premises. The plaintiffs brought this action against the defendant for damages caused thereby, and alleged, in paragraph 6 of the complaint, the following:\\\\n\\\\u201cThat at the time of the lease as aforesaid the said premises were desirable particularly for the purpose of plaintiffs\\\\u2019 said business as well as valuable for other commercial purposes, the same being located at 215 and 216 Madison street in the city of Seattle, then and there a popular and valuable location in the business district of said city; then graded and improved and easily accessible to the general public; that at the said time as aforesaid there was then in contemplation a great public improvement of the city known generally and publicly as the 2d Avenue regrade, and which, if the same took place during the life of the said lease, proposed it would, by reason of the interruption and disturbance in the enjoyment of the said premises render the said leasehold of little value as was then and there mutually agreed. That at the time of making the said lease, the plaintiffs and said defendants, by reason of the uncertain condition with respect to the contemplated change of grade in said Madison street, made no provision except as aforesaid in said indenture of lease regarding the remodeling and rebuilding of the said premises and store rooms situated therein. The said defendant landlord and these plaintiffs then and there further agreeing, by an oral, collateral contemporaneous agreement that if the said public improvement did take place during the life of the said lease, with its then agreed attendant damage, and the beneficial enjoyment of the possession be interrupted, that the said defendant R. J. Ferguson would remodel, reconstruct and repair said building as leased, by lowering the floors of the store rooms so leased, to wit eighteen feet, so as to put the same to the level of said Madison street, these plaintiffs agreeing to remove to said store rooms when said floors should have been so lowered. That by so lowering said floor, as aforesaid, the said R. J. Ferguson would be permitted thereby to create a new and additional rentable room in said building above the store rooms then to be occupied by these plaintiffs; and the said lessor then and there further agreed as a further and a part consideration, and as an inducement to enter into said lease hereinbefore described between the plaintiffs and the said defendant R. J. Ferguson, to build and construct a new entrance to the said store rooms, with an attractive glass front and with tiled flooring at the entrance, and to put in new and additional side and end windows, thereby creating said building, whence said floor had been so lowered, into an attractive and desirable store room for the use of these plaintiffs. And as a further part of said agreement, agreed to cause to be constructed a sidewalk in front of said building and premises, and otherwise to so improve the same that they would present an attractive and inviting appearance.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe complaint did not set out a copy of the lease. The defendant, when he appeared in the action, moved the court to strike this paragraph from the complaint. When this motion was denied, defendant demurred, and when the demurrer was overruled, filed an answer setting up the lease, and denied all the facts as alleged in regard to a collateral, contemporaneous, oral agreement. WTien the case was on trial, the defendant objected to the testimony offered in support of the allegations of the complaint as quoted above. These objections were overruled, and the plaintiffs were permitted to testify to the facts substantially as alleged in the complaint. At the close of plaintiffs\\\\u2019 evidence, defendant moved to strike it and for a dismissal.\\\\nThe defendant contended below, and now urges here, that the facts alleged and testified to contradicted and varied the terms of the written lease and were therefore incompetent. The plaintiffs maintain that the evidence was admissible, because it tended to prove an oral, collateral, contemporaneous agreement. The rule is elementary that a written contract may not be varied or contradicted by parol. The rule is also well settled that parol evidence of collateral, oral agreements may be received where the parties have not, by their written contract, appeared to intend to reduce their entire negotiations to written form. Puget Sound Iron & Steel Works v. Clemmons, 32 Wash. 36, 72 Pac. 465; 1 Elliott, Evidence, \\\\u00a7 578. So that the main and controlling question here is, Was the alleged oral agreement a collateral one, or was it a part of the contract of lease. In Elliott on Evidence, \\\\u00a7 578, it is said:\\\\n\\\\u201cParol evidence of a distinct, valid, parol agreement between the parties, although prior to or contemporaneous with the written contract, is not excluded by the rule in question where it does not in any way vary or contradict the writing, and there are some cases in which this is true, although the parol agreement may be collateral to the written contract and relate in some way to the same subject-matter, at least where the writing is silent upon the subject and the parol agreement does not appear to be so closely connected with the matter of the written contract that it should be deemed to have entered into the negotiations or formed a part of the transactions or matter of which the writing was intended to be a complete and final statement. But a complete, valid, written contract merges all prior and contemporaneous negotiations and agreements within its purview, and if the parol agreement is not really collateral, but is an element of the written contract, or tends to vary or contradict the same, either in its express provisions or its legal import, it is inadmissible. The question usually is as to whether the parol evidence sought to be introduced contradicts or alters the written contract, or leaves it to stand unchanged and simply tends to establish an additional collateral agreement. It is often difficult to determine this question, and there is much conflict among the authorities.\\\\u201d\\\\nIn the next section, 579, the same author says:\\\\n\\\\u201cThere is also a class of cases in which it is held that oral evidence of a collateral contemporaneous- agreement which assumes the. contract as indicated by. the writing and undertakes to deal with some contingency, or new relation of the parties in the future that may arise under the written agreement, is admissible. It has also been held that parol evidence is admissible ... to show an agreement to destroy game, rebuild or repair as collateral to a lease, and to show an agreement by a vendor or lessor not to engage in a rival or competing business. But many of these decisions are of questionable soundness, and, as shown in the next section, the weight of authority is against some of them.\\\\u201d\\\\nAnd in the next section, 580, it is said:\\\\n\\\\u201cSo, contrary to decisions referred to in the preceding section, it has been held that a prior or contemporaneous parol agreement by a vendor or lessor not to carry on a competing business is inadmissible where the written contract appears to be complete. And so the better rule is that an oral warranty of the condition of the premises or agreement on the part of the lessor to make repairs .or improvements cannot be shown in such a case.\\\\u201d\\\\nThis appears to be the correct rule, and the one substantially followed by us in Gordon v. Parke & Lacy Mach. Co., 10 Wash. 18, 38 Pac. 755; Morris v. Healy Lumber Co., 46 Wash. 686, 91 Pac. 186, and Tobin v. McArthur, 56 Wash. 523, 106 Pac. 180. It is, therefore, not necessary for us to review the numerous cases which follow or deny the rule.\\\\nIt is conceded in this case that, after negotiations which led up to it, the lease in question was made. It bears upon its face evidence of careful preparation, and shows that the parties to it had considered the many questions in regard to the property; and upon the evidence introduced, it is not questioned that the parties discussed and considered the change in the street grades and its effect upon the property. The written lease provides: \\\\u201cThat said lessee hereby accepts said premises for the term of two years;\\\\u201d \\\\u201cthat said lessee agrees to pay any and all charges for heat,\\\\u201d \\\\u201cand agrees to make all necessary repairs of whatsoever nature to the interior of said premises;\\\\u201d \\\\u201cthat the said lessee shall not use said premises for saloon or restaurant purposes nor let or sub-let the whole or any part thereof nor make or permit to be made any changes or alterations whatsoever without the written consent of the lessor.\\\\u201d This appears to be a plain lease, where the lessor agreed to do nothing except to deliver possession of the premises to the lessee, who agreed to accept the premises as they then were, for a period of two years, and agreed to make all necessary repairs to the interior, and to make no changes or alterations to the building without the written consent of the lessor or his agents. Where there is no express agreement for the lessor to repair or alter the building, no such obligation will be implied. The duty devolves upon the lessee. 24 Cyc. 1081 et seq.; 18 Am. & Eng. Ency. Law (2d ed.), p. 226; Ward v. Hinkleman, 37 Wash. 375, 79 Pac. 956.\\\\nIf there was an agreement by the lessor prior to this writing, to change or repair the building during the term of the lease, that agreement was as much a part of the contract of lease as any other, and should have been incorporated in it. It was clearly not a collateral agreement under the rule first above stated. If tfye agreement was made as alleged and attempted to be proved, it was a part of the contract of lease, and it is strange that so important a matter should have been left out of the written agreement. As was said by Lord Ellenborough, in Powell v. Edmunds, 12 East 6, at page 10:\\\\n\\\\u201cIf the parol evidence were admissible in this case, I know\\' of no instance where a party may not. by parol testimony superadd any terms to a written agreement; which would be setting aside all written contracts and rendering them of no effect.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe trial court therefore erred in not sustaining the defendant\\\\u2019s objection to the evidence, and in refusing to dismiss the case upon the defendant\\\\u2019s motion.\\\\nThe judgment is therefore reversed, and the cause ordered dismissed.\\\\nDunbar, C.

H. Gowman, its tenant, of a water pipe in the upper story of a building owned by the trust company, and negligently permitting the pipe to burst from freezing, thereby causing a large quantity of water to be precipitated upon the goods of the plaintiff in its store, occupying the ground floor of the building. A trial resulted in verdict and judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant trust company, and exonerating the defendant \\' Gowman. The trust company has appealed.\\\\nThe clothing company occupied the ground floor and basement of the building under a lease as a tenant of the trust company, while Gowman occupied the entire second floor of the building under a lease as tenant of the trust company. Both tenants had been in the occupancy of their respective leased premises for several years. These were entirely separate tenancies. In so far as the right of either tenant to go upon or interfere with the premises leased by the other, such right was no different than as if each occupied a separate building under their respective leases. The provisions of the leases do not call for any particular notice here, except possibly the following provision found in each of them:\\\\n\\\\u201cAnd the said party of the second part [the tenant] does covenant and agree with the said party of the first part, its successors and assigns, that the said party of the second part shall and will make all interior repairs to said rooms during the life of this lease and without any cost to the party of the first part.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe building is situated at 716, Riverside avenue, in Spokane, being on the northerly side of that avenue. It is but two stories high in addition to its basement. It is not supplied with heat other than such as the respective tenants supplied for themselves. The second floor was occupied by Gowman and wife with a photograph gallery and their living rooms, and also by a dentist who was a subtenant of Gowman. Water was supplied to the second floor through a pipe which ran from the avenue into the basement and up through the clothing company\\\\u2019s store on its westerly wall, some distance back from the avenue, passing into a toilet room on the second floor, situated near the middle of that floor on the westerly side of a hallway running north and south. In the basement, there was a cut-off in the pipe leading to the upper floor by which the water could be entirely shut off from that floor. From the toilet on the upper floor, a pipe ran under the floor of the hallway to a sink in the room on the east side of the hall. This room was included in Gowman\\\\u2019s tenancy, though seemingly unoccupied, save possibly as a storeroom. The pipe leading to the sink in this room had a cut-off near the bowl in the toilet room. Whether reasonable inspection by Gowman under the circumstances would have disclosed to him the fact that this pipe carried water across the hall to the sink, and that the water could have been cut off therefrom by this cut-off, is one of the principal controverted questions touching both his and the trust company\\\\u2019s negligence. The damage occurred from the bursting by freezing of this pipe at a point near the sink in this room, on the east side of the hall, during a very cold night in January, when such freezing and bursting of the pipe might have been anticipated with the water left in it, and might have been prevented by the use of the cut-off in the toilet room. Another pipe ran under the floor of the hall into the dental rooms at the front of the building. There was a cut-off in this pipe under the floor of the hall nearly opposite the sink in the room to the east of the hall. Gowman claims that he thought this cut-off could be used to stop the flow of water to the sink as well as to the dental rooms. This cut-off was accessible by raising a loose board left for that purpose over it in the floor of the hall.\\\\nDuring the evening of the night when the bursting of the pipe at the sink occurred, Gowman, deeming it a necessary precaution because of the intense cold, turned the cut-off in the hall floor to stop the flow of water, as he had often done during previous cold .spells. Gowman testified, in substance, that, when he went into possession of the upper floor under his lease, the cut-off in the floor of the hall was called to his attention by the agent of the trust company and that the agent then requested him \\\\u201cto see that this shut-off was shut off during cold weather, to prevent any freezing of the water in the dental rooms;\\\\u201d also, that other cut-offs in the upper floor were then called to his attention but the one in the toilet room was not then mentioned; though we may assume, for argument\\\\u2019s sake, that Gowman knew it was there. He also testified, in substance, that there was nothing to indicate that the pipe supplying the sink in the room to the east of the hall came from the toilet room. Two experienced plumbers testified, in substance, that the cut-off in the toilet room was simply such as are usually installed in such places to enable repairs to be made to toilets and that there was nothing, so far as the outward appearance of the plumbing was concerned, to indicate that the pipe leading to the sink came from the toilet room or that the cut-off therein controlled the flow of water to the sink, but that from outward appearances, the cut-off under the hall floor seemed to be the one to check the flow of water to the sink, though, as demonstrated by the freezing and bursting of the pipe here involved, that was not the fact. The trial court submitted to the jury a special interrogatory, which it answered and returned with its verdict, as follows:\\\\n\\\\u201cDid the defendant Gowman, under all the circumstances of this case, at and immediately prior to the time of the alleged freezing and bursting of the water pipe, act as an ordinary prudent man would have acted relative to the water pipe? Ans. Yes.\\\\u201d\\\\nThe principal contention made by counsel for the trust company is that the trial court erred in refusing to dispose of the cause in its favor as a matter of law upon its motions for nonsuit, for instructed verdict, and for judgment nothwithstanding the verdict. It is argued that the trust company was entitled to have the cause so disposed of, (1) because of failure of proof showing any negligence on the part of the trust company; and (2) because the evidence conclusively showed that whatever damage the clothing company suffered was the result of its own negligence. We will notice these in order.\\\\nWas there sufficient evidence to sustain the jury\\\\u2019s conclusion that the trust company\\\\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of the damage? We ignore, for the present, the question of the clothing company\\\\u2019s contributory negligence. Had the trust company been in the actual occupancy of the second floor as owner, instead of such occupancy being by its tenant Gowman, it seems to us there would be but little room for serious argument in defense of the trust company, in view of the well recognized necessity of taking precautions against the bursting of water pipes by freezing and the means readily at hand on that floor to exercise such precaution. The trust company actually knew of the cut-off in the floor of the hall, and in the absence of evidence showing to the contrary, we think the jury were warranted in believing that the trust company also knew that the cut-off in the toilet room would stop the flow of water to the sink; the placing of the pipe leading from the toilet to the sink in the store room being before Gowman\\\\u2019s tenancy commenced, and done presumably at the instance of the trust company, the owner of the building. Now, if all this knowledge of the trust company, which we conclude the jury were warranted in believing it possessed, touching the means at hand for cutting off the water to prevent freezing, had been in possession of Gowman, counsel for the trust company might well argue that it was Gowman\\\\u2019s negligence in not shutting off the water flowing to the sink which was the proximate cause of the damage. But it was the duty of the trust company, as owner of the building, to inform Gowman of the means provided by it to shut off the water flowing to the sink, either by specific directions, as it did relative to the cut-off in the hall floor, and other cut-offs upon Gowman\\\\u2019s leased premises, or by having the plumbing so constructed in its building as to render it apparent to Gowman upon reasonable inspection that the cut-off in the toilet room would stop the flow of water to the sink. In view of the apparent condition of the plumbing, indicating, as testified to by the plumbers, that the cut-off in the hall would stop the flow of water to the sink as well as the flow to the dental rooms, and the other circumstances the evidence tends to show, we think the jury was justified in malting their special finding which, in effect, exonerated Gowman from all negligence in his failure to cut off the flow of water to the sink by the use of the cut-off in the toilet room, and that the negligence of the trust company induced Gowman to so act, and thus became, as we think the jury could rightfully conclude, the proximate cause of the damage. Among the decisions called to our notice dealing with the negligence of tenants on upper floors causing damages to those on lower floors, the following are of interest: Lederer v. Fox, 151 Ill. App. 300; McCarthy v. York County Sav. Bank, 74 Me. 315, 43 Am. Rep. 591; Allen v. Smith, 76 Me. 335; Kenny v. Barns, 67 Mich. 336, 34 N. W. 587; Lebensburger v. Scofield, 155 Fed. 85, 12 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1025, and note.\\\\nThese decisions, however, turn upon the question of the negligence of the upper tenant, and are of but little aid here, in view of the jury\\\\u2019s finding exonerating Gowman, the upper tenant, from negligence, which finding, we conclude, was justified by the evidence. The following decisions are of interest touching the question of a landlord\\\\u2019s negligence in allowing water to escape in upper stories under his control, thereby causing damage to his tenant\\\\u2019s goods occupying a lower story: Priest v. Nichols, 116 Mass. 401; Freidenburg Co. v. Jones, 63 Ga. 612; and our own recent decision in LeVette v. Hardman Estate, 77 Wash. 320, 137 Pac. 454.\\\\nThese decisions, however, cannot be said to be directly in point upon the exact question here involved, nor has any decision come to our notice which can be said to be exactly in point. We think, however, the logic of the decisions above noticed, relating to negligence of tenants and landlords controlling upper floors resulting in damage to tenants occupying lower floors, support the conclusion that the facts of this case warranted the jury in finding that the negligence of the trust company was the proximate cause of the injury here complained of in that such negligence resulted in Gowman\\\\u2019s failure to shut off the water flowing in the pipe to the sink. Our attention has been called to Buckley v. Cunningham, 103 Ala. 449, 15 South. 826, 49 Am. St. 42. That decision, however, in so far as it may be regarded as applicable to this situation, is seemingly not in harmony with our views expressed in Le Vette v. Hardman Estate, supra.\\\\nWas the evidence such as to enable the court to determine, as a matter of law, that the clothing company\\\\u2019s contributory negligence was the proximate cause of the damage suffered? We think not. It is true, there was, in the basement occupied by the clothing company, a cut-off which would, if used, have stopped the flow of water to the entire upper floor. The failure of the clothing company to stop this flow of water to the upper floor and thereby prevent freezing, by the use of this cut-off, is claimed to be the principal act of contributory negligence on its part. We have seen that the tenancies were entirely separate.\\' It seems quite clear to us that the clothing company would have no more right to turn this cut-off and stop the flow of water to the upper floor than it would to go off its own leased premises and stop the flow of water to that floor. That pipe and the water flowing through it, while upon the clothing company\\\\u2019s leased premises, was not for its use, and was no more a part of its leased premises than as if it had been, in fact, physically off such premises. The argument amounts in substance to this; that the clothing company did not anticipate the negligence of those who were in control of, or responsible for, the taking of proper precaution to prevent the freezing and bursting of water pipes on the upper floor, which floor, we have noticed, was no part of the premises leased by the clothing company. While it may be contributory negligence under some circumstances not to anticipate fault in others, yet it cannot be said, as a matter of law, that it was so on the part of the clothing company under the circumstances here shown. Thompson, Negligence, \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 190, 191. The clothing company had occupied the ground floor and basement of this building for a number of years. It had manifestly never had occasion to anticipate that proper precaution would not be taken by those in control of the upper floor to prevent freezing and bursting of the water pipes on that floor; though it is apparently conceded that, in the climate of Spokane, in a building such as this, without any other heat than such as the tenants themselves furnished, it was necessary, during the winter months, to take such precautions. We have had occasion to deal with the question of damages occurring upon leased premises as between the landlord and the tenant of the particular premises upon which the claimed negligence occurred, in Howard v. Washington Water Power Co., 75 Wash. 255, 134 Pac. 927, and Mesher v. Osborne, 75 Wash. 439, 134 Pac. 1092. This, however, is not a case of the clothing company exercising the proper control and care over its own leased premises, but, so far as its contributory negligence is concerned, it becomes a question of its anticipating the negligence of others upon premises which it did not occupy.\\\\nSome contention is made rested upon the duty of these tenants, to wit, the clothing company and Gowman, to make \\\\u201cinterior repairs\\\\u201d upon their respective leased premises as provided in their leases. We are unable, however, to see that this provision touches any duty of the clothing company as to needed repairs upon Gowman\\\\u2019s premises, defective condition of plumbing therein, or negligence on the part of Gowman or the trust company in failing to properly control the water on that floor, in view of the fact that the respective tenancies were entirely separate and independent of each other. We think what we have said disposes, in substance, of the numerous assignments of error made by counsel for the trust company, and that further discussion is not called for.\\\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\\\nFullerton, Morris, and Mount, JJ., concur.\",\"type\":\"majority\",\"author\":\"Parker, J.\"}],\"attorneys\":[\"David Herman and W.

The negligence of a landlord of a two-story building, the different floors of which were leased to separate tenants, in failing to prevent the pipes from freezing and flooding the lower story, is a question for the jury, where there was evidence that one cut-off for that purpose was so located as not to attract the attention of the upper tenant, in the exercise of reasonable care, and that the landlord did not point it out to him, so that the upper tenant was not guilty of negligence in failing to discover it and shut off the water.\\\\nSame \\\\u2014 Contributory Negligence \\\\u2014 Question for Jury. A tenant in a lower story is not guilty of contributory negligence, as a matter of law, preventing a recovery for damages when pipes in the upper story were frozen and burst, flooding the lower premises, from the fact that, in the basement occupied by him, there was a cut-off to the pipe serving the second story which, if used, would stop the flow of water to the upper story; since the pipe was not under his control and he was not bound to anticipate the negligence of the upper tenant in not taking proper precautions to prevent the pipes from freezing.\\\\nSame \\\\u2014 Injury to Tenant\\\\u2019s Goods \\\\u2014 Lease\\\\u2014Effect of Provisions.

       "\"The prominent legal precedents in Washington regarding water leaking into an apartment from the floor above can be grouped under two main legal principles: **Negligence** and **Implied Warranty of Habitability**.\\n\\n### 1. Negligence\\nNegligence involves a failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances. In the context of landlord-tenant relationships, this principle can apply when a landlord or tenant fails to maintain the premises in a way that prevents foreseeable harm, such as water damage from leaking pipes.\\n\\n#### Prominent Cases:\\n- **Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co.**: The court found that the landlord could be liable for damages resulting from the negligent maintenance of a water pipe that burst and caused water damage to the tenant's property. The court emphasized the landlord's duty to inform the tenant of the means to prevent such damage.\\n- **Jorgensen v. Massart**: The court held that a tenant who undertook to mop up water leaking from a neighboring apartment was not necessarily acting unreasonably or negligently, and the issue of contributory negligence was a question for the jury.\\n\\n### 2. Implied Warranty of Habitability\\nThis principle implies that landlords must provide and maintain rental properties in a condition fit for human habitation. Breaches of this warranty can provide tenants with defenses against claims for unpaid rent and grounds for damages.\\n\\n#### Prominent Cases:\\n- **Foisy v. Wyman**: The court recognized an implied warranty of habitability in rental agreements, holding that tenants could raise this as a defense in unlawful detainer actions. The court found that the tenant should be allowed to introduce evidence of the landlord's failure to maintain the premises in a habitable condition.\\n- **DeHoney v. Gjarde**: The court found that a contractor's failure to construct a building according to plans and specifications, resulting in water damage, constituted a breach of contract. This case supports the idea that landlords (or builders) must ensure the property is constructed and maintained to prevent such issues.\\n\\n### Grouping of Prominent Cases by Legal Principles:\\n- **Negligence**:\\n  - **Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co.**\\n  - **Jorgensen v. Massart**\\n\\n- **Implied Warranty of Habitability**:\\n  - **Foisy v. Wyman**\\n  - **DeHoney v. Gjarde**\\n\\nThese cases collectively establish that landlords have a duty to maintain rental properties in a habitable condition and can be held liable for damages resulting from their negligence or failure to uphold this implied warranty.\""

       "\"The prominent legal precedents in Washington regarding water leaking into an apartment from the floor above can be grouped into two main legal principles: \\n\\n1. **Landlord's Duty to Repair and Maintain Safe Conditions**:\\n   - **Principle**: Landlords have a duty to maintain the premises in a condition that is safe and habitable. This includes addressing issues such as water leaks that can cause damage to a tenant's property or affect the habitability of the premises.\\n   - **Cases**:\\n     - **Mabel Le Vette v. Hardman Estate (1914)**: The Washington Supreme Court held that a landlord is responsible for maintaining the premises in a condition of reasonable safety. If a landlord negligently fails to repair or maintain the premises, resulting in damage to a tenant's property, the landlord can be held liable for damages. In this case, the landlord was found negligent for failing to repair a broken water pipe, which caused water to leak into the tenant's storeroom, damaging her goods.\\n     - **Stuart v. Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, Inc. (1987)**: The court recognized a duty of proper construction and maintenance, including nonnegligent construction of elements within common and limited common areas. The court held that a builder-vendor could be liable for negligent construction practices that left structures unsafe and unfit for their intended purpose.\\n\\n2. **Implied Warranty of Habitability**:\\n   - **Principle**: There is an implied warranty of habitability in residential leases, which means that the landlord guarantees that the premises are fit for living. This includes ensuring that the property is free from significant defects such as water leaks.\\n   - **Cases**:\\n     - **Westlake View Condominium Ass'n v. Sixth Avenue View Partners, LLC (2008)**: The court held that the implied warranty of habitability applies to serious structural deficiencies that present a substantial risk of future danger. In this case, the court found that issues such as water intrusion, inadequate drainage, and structural problems with decks and windows could breach the implied warranty of habitability.\\n     - **Burbo v. Harley C. Douglass, Inc. (2005)**: The court recognized that significant construction defects, including water leaks and structural issues, could breach the implied warranty of habitability. The court emphasized that such defects must be shown to impair the fitness of the home for its intended purpose.\\n\\nIn summary, Washington courts have established that landlords have a duty to repair and maintain safe conditions in rental properties and that there is an implied warranty of habitability that protects tenants from significant defects such as water leaks. These principles are supported by cases such as Mabel Le Vette v. Hardman Estate and Westlake View Condominium Ass'n v. Sixth Avenue View Partners, LLC.\""
