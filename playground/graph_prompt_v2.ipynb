       "\"The prominent legal precedents in Washington regarding water leaking into an apartment from the floor above can be grouped into two main legal principles: **Landlord's Duty to Repair and Maintain** and **Negligence and Liability**.\\n\\n### 1. Landlord's Duty to Repair and Maintain\\nThis principle involves the landlord's obligation to keep the premises in a habitable condition and to make necessary repairs to prevent damage to the tenant's property.\\n\\n**Prominent Cases:**\\n- **Foisy v. Wyman**: This case established that landlords have an implied warranty of habitability, meaning they must maintain the premises in a condition fit for human habitation. The court held that the landlord's failure to maintain the premises in a habitable condition constitutes a breach of this warranty and can be a defense in an unlawful detainer action.\\n- **Thomas v. Housing Authority of the City of Bremerton**: The court held that a public housing authority could not exempt itself from liability for its own negligence through a lease provision. The landlord was found liable for injuries caused by excessively hot water due to a defective water heater, emphasizing the landlord's duty to maintain safe and habitable conditions.\\n\\n### 2. Negligence and Liability\\nThis principle addresses the landlord's liability for damages caused by their negligence in maintaining the premises, particularly when such negligence leads to property damage or personal injury.\\n\\n**Prominent Cases:**\\n- **Le Vette v. Hardman Estate**: The court found the landlord liable for water damage caused by a broken water pipe in the upper story of a building. The landlord's failure to inspect and repair the premises, despite knowing about the potential for damage, constituted negligence.\\n- **Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co.**: The court held the landlord liable for water damage to the tenant's property caused by a burst water pipe in the upper story. The landlord's failure to inform the tenant about the means to prevent freezing and bursting of the pipe was deemed negligent.\\n\\nThese cases collectively highlight the landlord's responsibility to maintain the premises in a habitable condition and their liability for damages resulting from their negligence in failing to do so.\""

       "\"The prominent legal precedents in Washington regarding water leaking into an apartment from the floor above can be grouped into two main legal principles:\\n\\n1. **Negligence and Duty of Care**:\\n   - **Landlord's Duty to Maintain Premises**: Landlords have a duty to maintain the premises in a condition of reasonable safety, especially when they retain control over parts of the building that can affect tenants' safety. This includes ensuring that water pipes and other fixtures are properly maintained to prevent leaks and other hazards.\\n     - **Mabel Le Vette v. Hardman Estate**: The court held that the landlord was responsible for maintaining the upper stories of a building in a condition of reasonable safety. The landlord's failure to inspect and repair broken water pipes, which led to water damage in the tenant's storeroom, constituted negligence.\\n     - **Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co.**: The court found the landlord negligent for failing to inform the tenant about the proper cut-off valves to prevent water pipes from freezing and bursting, which caused water damage to the tenant's property.\\n\\n2. **Res Ipsa Loquitur**:\\n   - **Exclusive Control and Inference of Negligence**: The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur allows for an inference of negligence when the instrumentality causing the damage was under the exclusive control of the defendant, and the accident is of a type that ordinarily does not happen without negligence.\\n     - **United Mutual Savings Bank v. Riebli**: The court applied the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, holding that the tenant in control of the premises where the water pipe burst was presumed negligent because the pipe was under their exclusive control, and such an incident typically does not occur without negligence.\\n     - **Imperial Candy Co. v. City of Seattle**: The court found the city negligent for failing to inspect and maintain the foundation of a water meter, which led to a pipe break and subsequent water damage. The city's failure to inspect and replace the defective foundation was deemed a lack of reasonable care.\\n\\nThese cases illustrate the principles of landlord liability for maintaining safe premises and the application of res ipsa loquitur in situations where the cause of damage is under the exclusive control of the defendant.\""

    "\"The prominent legal precedents in Washington regarding water leaking into an apartment from the floor above can be grouped into two main legal principles:\\n\\n1. **Negligence and Duty of Care**:\\n   - **Le Vette v. Hardman Estate**: This case established that a landlord has a duty to maintain and control the premises in a condition of reasonable safety, especially when the upper floors are vacant and under the landlord's control. The landlord was found negligent for failing to inspect and secure the upper floors, which led to water damage in the tenant's storeroom below.\\n   - **Uhl Bros. v. Hull**: This case reinforced that a landlord is not an insurer of the premises but is liable for negligence if they fail to exercise ordinary care. The landlord was not found liable because the defect in the water pipes was not known and could not have been discovered through ordinary care.\\n   - **Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co.**: This case highlighted that a landlord could be held liable for damages caused by water from the upper floors if the landlord failed to inform the tenant of the means to prevent such damage or if the landlord's negligence induced the tenant's failure to act.\\n\\n2. **Implied Warranty of Fitness**:\\n   - **Frisken v. Art Strand Floor Coverings, Inc.**: This case dealt with the implied warranty of fitness, where the seller (or contractor) is expected to provide goods or services that are fit for the intended purpose. The contractor was held liable for failing to inform the property owner of potential issues with the flooring installation, which led to damage.\\n\\nProminent cases grouped by these principles:\\n\\n**Negligence and Duty of Care**:\\n- **Le Vette v.

The landlord must respond in damages if it negligently allows the upper story to be out of repair, causing damage to the tenant below.\\n   - **Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co.

Housing Authority of the City of Bremerton (1967)**: The court emphasized that a landlord could be held liable for maintaining a dangerous condition if the general type of danger was reasonably foreseeable. The landlord's knowledge of the potential danger and failure to take reasonable precautions could result in liability for injuries caused by such conditions.\\n   - **Imperial Candy Co. v.

If they fail to do so and this failure results in damage to a tenant's property, they may be held liable for negligence.\\n   - **Cases**:\\n     - **Le Vette v.

The landlord's knowledge and failure to act were key factors in establishing negligence.\\n     - **Thomas v. Housing Authority of the City of Bremerton**: The court held that the housing authority was negligent for not ensuring the safety of the water heater, which caused severe burns to a child. The landlord's duty to provide safe and sanitary housing was highlighted.\\n\\n2. **Tenant's Contributory Negligence and Reasonable Care**:\\n   - **Principle**: Tenants may also have a duty to take reasonable care to prevent damage. However, if the landlord's negligence is the primary cause of the damage, the tenant's contributory negligence may not bar recovery.\\n   - **Cases**:\\n     - **Jorgensen v. Massart**: The court discussed the tenant's actions in response to a water leak and whether they constituted contributory negligence. The tenant's reasonable efforts to mitigate damage were considered.\\n     - **Imperial Candy Co. v. City of Seattle**: The court found that the tenant was not contributorily negligent for using a basement without a drain, as the primary cause of the damage was the city's negligence in maintaining the water main.\\n     - **Tombari v. City of Spokane**: The court held that the city was liable for flooding caused by an inadequate sewer system, despite the tenant's failure to install a backwater trap. The tenant's contributory negligence did not bar recovery because the city's negligence was the primary cause.\\n\\nThese cases illustrate the balance between the landlord's duty to maintain safe premises and the tenant's duty to take reasonable care, with a focus on the landlord's primary responsibility for preventing and addressing hazardous conditions.\""
