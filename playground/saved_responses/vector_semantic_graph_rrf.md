"In Washington, several legal principles and cases address the issue of water leaking into an apartment from the floor above. Here are the top legal principles and prominent cases that illustrate them:

1. **Landlord's Duty to Repair and Maintain**:
   - **Principle**: Landlords have a duty to maintain and repair the premises to ensure they are habitable and safe for tenants. This includes addressing issues like leaks that can cause damage or make the premises uninhabitable.
   - **Prominent Cases**:
     - **Foisy v. Wyman, 83 Wash. 2d 22 (1973)**: The court held that in all contracts for renting premises, there is an implied warranty of habitability. Breach of this warranty constitutes a defense in an unlawful detainer action. The landlord must keep the premises fit for human habitation, including maintaining roofs, floors, walls, and other structural components in reasonably good repair.
     - **Thomas v. Housing Authority of the City of Bremerton, 71 Wash. 2d 69 (1967)**: The court found that a landlord's failure to maintain hot water heaters, resulting in excessively hot water and injury, constituted a breach of duty. The case emphasizes the landlord's responsibility to ensure the safety and habitability of rental units.

2. **Negligence and Liability for Damages**:
   - **Principle**: A landlord can be held liable for damages resulting from negligence in maintaining the property. This includes failing to address known issues that lead to water damage or other hazards.
   - **Prominent Cases**:
     - **Martindale Clothing Co. v. Spokane & Eastern Trust Co., 79 Wash. 643 (1914)**: The court held that a landlord could be liable for damages caused by the failure to prevent pipes from freezing and bursting, which resulted in flooding and damage to the tenant's property.
     - **Boyer v. City of Tacoma, 156 Wash. 280 (1930)**: The court ruled that a city (acting as a landlord) was liable for damages caused by an inadequate sewer system that resulted in flooding. The case underscores the principle that landlords must take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable damage from known issues.

3. **Implied Warranty of Habitability**:
   - **Principle**: There is an implied warranty that rental properties are habitable and fit for living. This warranty requires landlords to maintain the property in a condition suitable for occupancy.
   - **Prominent Cases**:
     - **Foisy v. Wyman, 83 Wash. 2d 22 (1973)**: The court established that there is an implied warranty of habitability in all rental agreements, requiring landlords to maintain the premises in a livable condition.
     - **Pappas v. Zerwoodis, 21 Wash. 2d 725 (1944)**: The court discussed the landlord's obligation to repair and maintain the premises, emphasizing that failure to do so could result in liability for damages.

These principles and cases illustrate the legal framework in Washington regarding a landlord's duty to maintain rental properties and the potential liability for failing to address issues like water leaks that can cause damage to tenants' property."
